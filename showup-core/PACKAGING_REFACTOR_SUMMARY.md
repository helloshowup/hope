# Showup Core Packaging and Import Refactor Summary

**Date:** 2025-05-22

## Overview

This document records the major packaging, import, and structural improvements made to the `showup-core` codebase to ensure robust Python packaging, maintainability, and compliance with modern development standards.

## Actions Performed

1. **Analyzed and Audited Intra-Package Imports**
   - Identified all intra-package imports across core modules.
   - Converted all intra-package imports to relative imports (e.g., `from .file_utils import ...`) for clarity and resilience to refactoring.

2. **Standardized Public API Imports**
   - Ensured all public APIs and external-facing imports use absolute imports (e.g., `from showup_core import ...`).
   - Updated `__init__.py` to expose public APIs using absolute imports, supporting external use and documentation.

3. **Directory Renaming for Python Packaging Compliance**
   - Renamed the `core/` directory to `showup_core/` to match the package name and Python import conventions.
   - Updated all references and packaging metadata to reflect the new structure.

4. **Created and Updated Python Packaging Files**
   - Added a `setup.py` file for editable installs and dependency management.
   - Updated `setup.py` to reference the correct package directory and dependencies.
   - Documented all changes in `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`.

5. **Validated Package Installation and Imports**
   - Installed the package in editable mode using `pip install -e .`.
   - Ran comprehensive smoke tests to confirm that `import showup_core` and all public modules work without `ImportError`.

6. **Maintained Compliance with Project Rules**
   - Ensured atomic moves, no code duplication, and single-source-of-truth for all modules.
   - Updated all documentation and migration records for traceability.

## Validation

- All modules now importable via `import showup_core` and `from showup_core import ...`.
- Intra-package imports use relative paths, reducing risk of import errors during future refactoring.
- Packaging is PEP-420 compliant and ready for further development or distribution.
