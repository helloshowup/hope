As market trends, consumer preferences, and design technologies change over time, graphic designs in a logo or packaging that once seemed modern, may now appear outdated, disconnected or often irrelevant.   \nRefreshing a logo allows brands to signal growth, innovation, or a shift in direction, helping them stay competitive and resonate with both existing and new audiences. Another reason for a design update might be to address more practical needs, such as improving logo visibility and adaptability in digital spaces (e.g. websites and mobile apps). A redesigned logo can simplify complex elements, ensuring clarity of smaller sizes and across a range of platforms. Beyond aesthetics, a brand’s design update often accompanies broader brand strategies, like mergers, expansions, or repositioning efforts.\n\n## Case Study\n\nFounded in 2005 and launched in 2007, Chobani is a popular Greek yoghurt brand in the U.S., created by Turkish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya after acquiring a defunct yoghurt factory in upstate New York. Under his leadership, Chobani became the top-selling yoghurt brand in the U.S. and earned a place as the preferred Greek yoghurt. By 2012, Chobani's remarkable growth led to it becoming an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic Team. In 2017, they redesigned the look and packaging of their brand:  \n![][image1]  \nFig 1\\. Earlier design (left) and updated 2017 design (right).\n\n## Over to you…\n\nIn the following task, you will critically analyse and compare the Chobani 2017 design with its earlier version, and suggest actionable improvements to enhance its effectiveness and appeal even more. By evaluating the current design's use of elements and principles, you will identify areas that can be optimised to better communicate the intended message or purpose. \n\n1. Examine the differences between the \"before\" and \"after\" Chobani designs and answer the following questions:  \n* What specific design elements (e.g. typography, colour, imagery, layout) have been modified?  \n* How have the design principles (e.g. balance, contrast, hierarchy, unity, etc.) been applied differently in the new version?\n\n\n2. Critically assess the changes and answer the following questions:  \n* Are the changes successful in improving functionality, aesthetics, or communication? Why or why not?  \n* How effectively does the \"after\" design address the intended audience or purpose compared to the \"before\" design?\n\n3. Using learned design principles, suggest potential enhancements to the \"after\" design:  \n* What additional changes could further improve the design?  \n* How would these changes enhance the message, usability, or overall impact?\n\nThis exercise aims to enhance critical analysis skills and application of design principles in real-world scenarios. You are encouraged to answer the above comparison, evaluation, and proposal questions and save your responses in digital format for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n### File: Step 52_Design Analysis Skills exercise.md ###\n\n## Introduction\n\nReflection is a major part of the growth process in any creative discipline, but particularly in graphic design. Consolidating one's learning through reflection allows you to recognise your strengths and areas for improvement, paving the way for more informed decisions in future projects. Identifying opportunities to apply analysis skills not only enhances technical execution, but also fosters a deeper understanding of design principles in real-world contexts. In the following exercise, you will be asked to do all of the above and create an actionable plan for personal implementation. This will help you transform abstract insights into practical strategies, ultimately refining your craft and advancing your creative journey.\n\n## Over to you…\n\nIn this task, you will need to consolidate the insights you have gained from analysing the Chobani design examples (Lesson 51\\) and reflect on how these skills can be integrated into your personal design work. \n\n![][image1]  \nFig 1\\. Earlier design (left) and updated 2017 design (right)\n\nBy engaging in structured reflection, you will be able to identify opportunities for improvement and create a detailed, actionable plan to apply critical analysis in your future projects. \n\n1. Produce a guided reflection in your sketchbook or in digital format, where you answer the following questions:  \n* What are the three most valuable insights you gained from previous analysis exercises, for instance, the Chobani design evolution?  \n* How have these insights shaped your understanding of effective design?  \n* Reflect on a recent personal design project. Where could you have applied these insights to improve the outcome?\n\n  Summarise your reflections by writing a concise paragraph (5–7 sentences) outlining their key takeaways and their significance in personal design practice.\n\n2. Identify areas in your personal work where critical analysis skills can be applied. To do this, consider the following:  \n* Which design principles do you find challenging to implement effectively?  \n* What opportunities exist in your current or upcoming projects to apply a more critical and analytical approach?  \n* How can these changes enhance the quality and impact of your work?\n\n3. Create an action plan that outlines your approach to integrating critical analysis skills. Include the following sections:  \n* **Goal:** What specific skill or insight will you focus on implementing?  \n* **Steps:** Outline 3–5 actionable steps to achieve this goal in a project.  \n* **Resources:** Identify resources (tools, techniques, feedback mechanisms) needed to execute the plan.  \n* **Evaluation:** Describe how you will measure the effectiveness of your improvements.\n\n\n  \nThis exercise aims to enhance critical analysis skills and the application of design principles in real-world scenarios. You are encouraged to answer the above reflective questions, skills analysis and action plan, and save your responses in digital format for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n### File: Step 53_Components of Design Brief.md ###\n\n## Understanding Key Elements of a Design Brief: A Guide for Graphic Design Students\n\n**Audio**  \n**Script**\n\nThe first thing to understand is \\- what exactly is a design brief? A design brief is a document that outlines the scope, goals, and requirements of a design project. The reason it exists is to act as a communication bridge between the client and designer \\- setting clear expectations for the requirements of the project. The brief ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project's direction and objectives \\- which ultimately saves time, minimises revisions, and fosters creativity.  \nNext are the key elements of a design brief. By understanding a design brief, designers can enhance their ability to meet project expectations effectively. Let’s look at the fundamental components of a design brief \\- by using real-life examples. \n\nWhen it came to the rebranding of Airbnb, the brief included detailed insights into its target audience, emphasising the need for a logo that reflected inclusivity and community. This clear definition allowed the design team to create the globally recognised \"Bélo\" logo, embodying belonging and connection.\n\n\\<Airbnb logo\\>\n\nSo \\- Let’s look at the different components of a design brief:\n\n#### First is the Project Overview\n\nThe overview provides a summary of the graphic design project, including its background and context. It introduces the designer to the project's purpose and the problem it seeks to solve.   \nFor Example \\- Nike’s brief for their “Just Do It” campaign highlighted their aim to inspire athletes globally while reinforcing the brand's identity.\n\n\\<Nike slogan\\>\n\n#### Then there is the target audience which involves a detailed description of the intended audience. This helps the designer create work that resonates with the specified demographic. \n\nLook at the Coca-Cola holiday campaigns, the brief specified families as the audience \\-  thus introducing the use of heartwarming imagery and cheerful tones.\n\n\\<Coca-Cola holiday ad\\>\n\n#### Another key element of a design brief is the Project Goals and Objectives\n\nWhich ultimately outlines what the project seeks to achieve. This includes increasing brand awareness, boosting sales, or promoting a specific event.   \nAn example of a clear objective can be found in Spotify Wrapped. This expresses Spotify's desire to thank their users, artists and creators on an annual basis with personalised playlists, therefore directing the design process towards more personal, impactful results.\n\n\\<Spotify Wrapped screenshot\\>\n\nAn important element is of course \\- Design requirements. This will specify the visual elements, colour palettes, typography, and any design constraints for the project. An example of design requirements is Apple's product packaging briefs that include strict guidelines to ensure sleek, minimalist designs \\- consistent with their brand identity. \n\n\\<Apple packaging\\>\n\n#### Then there is the Timeline and Budget \\- A realistic timeline and budget will set expectations for delivery and the allocation of resources. \n\n#### And finally \\- Deliverables \n\nThis section lists the expected outcomes, such as logos, advertisements, or product packaging.   \nBranding projects often include deliverables like logo files, promotional materials, and digital assets for social media.\n\nUnderstanding the elements of a design brief through real-world examples empowers graphic design students to grasp its practical applications.   \nBy mastering this essential skill, students can develop designs that align with client expectations, reflect the brand’s identity, and effectively communicate to the target audience. Each project brief becomes a stepping stone in building successful, impactful design solutions.\n\n\n\n### File: Step 54_Project Planning overview.md ###\n\nAudio script  \nAn overview of project planning\n\n## \n\nEffective project planning is the backbone of successful graphic design projects.   \nIt enables designers to manage resources, timelines, and deliverables efficiently.  \nUtilising project planning tools and techniques ensures that creative goals align with client expectations and that every stage of the process runs smoothly.  \nProject planning is essentially \\- a roadmap from concept to completion. \n\nTake for example the creation of **London’s 2012 Olympics logo**. This project had high-profile demands and tight deadlines.   \nBut \\- proper planning ensured a cohesive visual identity that resonated globally \\- emphasising the value of structured approaches in delivering impactful designs.\n\n### Let’s take a look at an Overview of Essential Project Planning Tools\n\n#### First \\- Gantt Charts\n\nA Gantt chart is a timeline-based visual planning tool that outlines tasks, their duration, and dependencies.   \nUsing a **Gantt chart** in a branding project for example \\- means tasks like research, logo creation, and final approval can be visually tracked.   \nTools like Microsoft Project or online options like Smartsheet, allow designers to easily create and interpret Gantt charts, ensuring every task is completed on schedule.\n\n#### Another option is to use **Kanban Board**s. Kanban boards \\- popularised by tools like Trello and Asana \\- use a card-based system to manage tasks. \n\nEach card represents a task and *moves* across stages such as,\"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" and \"Completed.\"   \nFor example \\- During a web design project, cards can track stages such as wireframing, prototyping, and final deployment.   \nKanban boards make it easy to manage workloads and visually track your progress.\n\n### Those are some tools \\- let’s have a quick look at some techniques for estimating project timelines and resources\n\n#### First and foremost is how to break down tasks. Rather than becoming overwhelmed with the size of a project \\-  begin by dividing the project into smaller, more manageable tasks. \n\nSometimes reverse planning can be helpful. This involves assessing the end point or delivery date and working back from that point in time to the current point in time.  \nSay for example you are designing a promotional flyer? This can involve research, concept sketches, drafting, and revisions. This breakdown helps estimate the time and resources needed for each stage.\n\n#### Then you will need to remember to allow for Buffer Time. This is to cover inevitable unexpected delays. A good rule of thumb is to add 10-15% extra time to each task’s estimated duration. \n\nSo in the example of an illustration project \\- buffer time can cover unforeseen revisions or technical hiccups.\n\n#### Finally \\- a vital step in project planning is Resource Allocation. Use tools like resource planners or spreadsheets to assign tasks to team members based on their skills. So \\- you would assign a  typographer for text layout to ensure efficient resource usage and to reduce bottlenecks.\n\n### \n\nBy employing tools like Gantt charts and Kanban boards \\- and applying effective planning techniques, graphic designers can navigate complex projects with confidence. These methods not only enhance productivity but also ensure the delivery of high-quality results that meet client expectations and deadlines.\n\n\n\n### File: Step 55_Guided Case Study.md ###\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this guided case study, you will see how the design process translates from theory to practice in a real-world context, using a coffee rebranding as an example. The design process (i.e. research, define, ideate, prototype, and test) serves as a structured approach to solving creative graphic design challenges, ensuring that designs are purposeful, impactful, and focused on the client and their requirements. \n\nThrough looking at a hypothetical company called “Cold Brew”, this case study is an example of how professional designers approach a project from start to finish, navigating constraints, addressing client needs, and refining ideas to deliver innovative solutions. This hands-on exploration will not only deepen your understanding of the design process but also inspire you to apply these principles to your own creative projects.\n\n## Detailed walkthrough of a real-world graphic design project\n\n### Step 1: Analysing the project brief\n\nThe project begins with a comprehensive briefing from the client. In this example, the client is the owner of a boutique coffee brand. They need branding and packaging for a new line of artisanal coffee beans. The key goals for the project include conveying the brand’s premium quality and eco-friendly ethos. \n\nDuring this step, the designer meets with the client to understand their vision, target audience, and key deliverables.\n\nTo-do list for this step:\n\n* Clarify project objectives.  \n* Define deliverables: logo, packaging, and social media visuals.  \n* Establish timelines and budget.\n\n![][image1]  \nFig. 1\\. Unsplash (n.d.) Meeting with client \n\n### Step 2: Research and Inspiration Gathering\n\nNext, the designer conducts research on the coffee industry, competitors, and design trends. They explore design styles that resonate with the target audience (identified in Step 1), such as minimalist aesthetics and earthy colour palettes. The designer also collects inspiration from a variety of sources, including Pinterest, Behance, and packaging stores.\n\nTo-do list for this step:\n\n* Analyse competitors’ designs for strengths and weaknesses.  \n* Create a mood board with imagery, textures, and colour schemes.\n\n### Step 3: Concept Development and Sketching\n\nBased on the research, the designer begins brainstorming ideas and sketching initial concepts for the logo and packaging layout. This stage is exploratory and focuses on generating multiple rough ideas to later refine.\n\nTo-do list for this step:\n\n* Sketch potential logos incorporating coffee-related symbolism.  \n* Develop layout ideas for packaging, considering elements like text placement and graphic illustrations.\n\n![][image2]  \nFig. 2\\. Unsplash (n.d) Developing ideas through hand-drawn sketches\n\n### Step 4: Design Execution Using Industry-Standard Software\n\nOnce the strongest concepts are chosen, the designer digitises them using software like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. This stage involves creating vector logos, applying the chosen colour palette, and designing packaging mockups.\n\nTo-do list for this step:\n\n* Digitise the selected logo design and refine the typography.  \n* Develop a packaging template and apply the design to a 3D mockup.\n\n### Step 5: Client Feedback and Revisions\n\nThe designer presents the initial concepts to the client for review. Feedback is collected to further refine the designs. For example, the client might request a brighter colour palette or adjustments to the logo’s typography.\n\nTo-do list for this step:\n\n* Incorporate client feedback into the design.  \n* Ensure the revisions align with the project goals.\n\n![][image3]  \nFig. 3\\. Pexels (n.d.) Mock up\n\n### Step 6: Final Presentation and Delivery\n\nThe final step involves presenting the polished designs to the client, showcasing how the branding works across different mediums. The deliverables are handed over to the client including high-resolution files and usage guidelines.\n\nTo-do list for this step:\n\n* Prepare a professional presentation highlighting the design’s strengths.  \n* Deliver files in the required formats (e.g. AI, PDF, PNG).\n\n[\n"
