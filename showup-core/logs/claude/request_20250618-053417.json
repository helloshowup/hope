This will be added during student orientation\n\n\n# Content to Enhance:\n\n# 1.12 Robotics Glossary for Module 1\n\n## Actuator\n**Definition:** A device that converts energy into movement or action, allowing robots to move or interact with their environment.\n\n**Example:** The motors in a robot's wheels are actuators that help it move around your classroom.\n\n## Algorithm\n**Definition:** A step-by-step set of instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.\n\n**Example:** The algorithm for a line-following robot might say: 'If you see the line, go forward. If you lose the line, turn until you find it again.'\n\n## Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n**Definition:** Computer systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions similar to humans. AI helps robots get smarter over time.\n\n**Example:** A smart speaker uses AI to understand your voice commands, even when you say things in different ways.\n\n## Autonomous\n**Definition:** Able to operate and make decisions without human control. Autonomous robots work independently.\n\n**Example:** An autonomous robot vacuum cleans your house by itself, deciding where to go without you controlling it.\n\n## Bump Sensor\n**Definition:** A simple touch sensor that activates when a robot collides with something in its path.\n\n**Example:** When your robot toy hits a wall, its bump sensor tells it to back up and turn another way.\n\n## Camera Sensor\n**Definition:** A device that captures images, allowing robots to \"see\" their surroundings and recognize objects.\n\n**Example:** Self-driving cars use camera sensors to see traffic lights, road signs, and other vehicles.\n\n## Chassis\n**Definition:** The main body or frame of a robot that supports and protects all the other components.\n\n**Example:** The chassis of your LEGO robot holds the motors, sensors, and controller together like a skeleton.\n\n## Cobot\n**Definition:** A collaborative robot designed to work safely alongside humans, often with special sensors to avoid accidents.\n\n**Example:** In a car factory, cobots help human workers lift heavy parts without bumping into people.\n\n## DC Motor\n**Definition:** An electric motor that provides continuous rotation, commonly used to power wheels in robots.\n\n**Example:** The DC motors in your remote-control car make the wheels spin forward or backward.\n\n## Distance Sensor\n**Definition:** A device that measures how far away objects are without touching them, helping robots avoid collisions.\n\n**Example:** Your robot uses a distance sensor like bat sonar to stop before bumping into walls.\n\n## End Effector\n**Definition:** The device at the end of a robot arm that interacts with objects, like a gripper, tool, or specialized attachment.\n\n**Example:** A robot in a chocolate factory might have a suction cup end effector to pick up delicate candies.\n\n## Encoder\n**Definition:** A sensor that tracks the position and movement of motors, helping robots know how far they've moved.\n\n**Example:** Encoders in a robot's wheels count rotations so it knows exactly how far it has traveled across the room.\n\n## Gripper\n**Definition:** A robot hand or claw that can grab, hold, and release objects. Grippers come in many different designs.\n\n**Example:** The claw in an arcade machine is a simple gripper that picks up prizes when you play the game.\n\n## Gyroscope\n**Definition:** A sensor that measures rotation and orientation, helping robots maintain balance and know which way they're facing.\n\n**Example:** A drone uses a gyroscope to stay level in the air, even when it's windy.\n\n## Humanoid Robot\n**Definition:** A robot designed to look and move like a human, with a head, torso, arms, and legs.\n\n**Example:** The robots in your science museum that can walk, wave, and dance are humanoid robots.\n\n## Input\n**Definition:** Information that a robot collects from its environment through sensors. This is how robots \"sense\" the world.\n\n**Example:** When you speak to a smart speaker, your voice is the input it uses to understand your request.\n\n## Input-Processing-Output Model\n**Definition:** A framework that explains how robots work by gathering information, making decisions, and taking actions.\n\n**Example:** A smart thermostat senses temperature, decides if it's too hot or cold, then turns heating or cooling on or off.\n\n## Light Sensor\n**Definition:** A device that detects brightness levels or colors, allowing robots to \"see\" and respond to light changes.\n\n**Example:** A line-following robot uses light sensors to detect the dark line against a light background.\n\n## Lidar\n**Definition:** A sensing system that uses laser light to measure distances and create detailed 3D maps of surroundings.\n\n**Example:** Self-driving cars use lidar to create a 3D map of the road, other vehicles, and pedestrians.\n\n## Machine Learning\n**Definition:** A type of AI that allows robots to improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every situation.\n\n**Example:** A robot vacuum learns the layout of your home over time and gets better at cleaning efficiently.\n\n## Microcontroller\n**Definition:** A small computer on a single chip that serves as the brain of simpler robots, processing sensor data and controlling actions.\n\n**Example:** The microcontroller in your robot kit reads sensor information and decides which motors to turn on.\n\n## Microphone\n**Definition:** A sensor that detects sound waves, allowing robots to \"hear\" voices, noises, and audio commands.\n\n**Example:** Smart speakers use microphones to hear when you say \"Hey Google\" or \"Alexa\" to wake them up.\n\n## Output\n**Definition:** Actions a robot takes to affect its environment, such as moving, making sounds, or displaying information.\n\n**Example:** When your robot toy moves its arms, flashes lights, or plays sounds, those are all outputs.\n\n## Processing\n**Definition:** How robots think and make decisions using computers or microcontrollers to interpret sensor data.\n\n**Example:** When your game console processes your controller movements to make characters move on screen.\n\n## Proximity Sensor\n**Definition:** A device that detects when objects are nearby without touching them, helping robots avoid collisions.\n\n**Example:** Automatic doors use proximity sensors to detect when you're approaching so they can open for you.\n\n## Sensor\n**Definition:** A device that detects changes in the environment and converts them into electrical signals robots can understand.\n\n**Example:** The sensors in your phone know when you rotate it and change the screen from portrait to landscape.\n\n## Servo Motor\n**Definition:** A motor that can move to exact positions and hold there, perfect for robot arms and precise movements.\n\n**Example:** The servo motors in a robot arm can position its gripper exactly where it needs to grab an object.\n\n## Social Robot\n**Definition:** A robot designed to interact with humans in a natural way, often recognizing faces, speech, or emotions.\n\n**Example:** Robot classroom assistants that can answer questions and help students with their work are social robots.\n\n## Stepper Motor\n**Definition:** A motor that moves in precise, fixed steps rather than rotating continuously, allowing for very accurate positioning.\n\n**Example:** 3D printers use stepper motors to move the printing head to exact locations with pinpoint accuracy.\n\n## Temperature Sensor\n**Definition:** A device that measures heat levels, allowing robots to detect hot or cold objects or monitor environmental conditions.\n\n**Example:** A cooking robot uses temperature sensors to know when food is properly cooked without burning it.\n\n## Touch Sensor\n**Definition:** A sensor that detects physical contact, acting like a robot's sense of touch to know when it bumps into something.\n\n**Example:** The buttons on your game controller are simple touch sensors that respond when you press them.\n\n## Ultrasonic Sensor\n**Definition:** A sensor that uses sound waves humans can't hear to measure distances, similar to how bats navigate.\n\n**Example:** Parking assist systems use ultrasonic sensors to beep faster as your car gets closer to obstacles.\n\n## Unimate\n**Definition:** The first industrial robot, created in 1961 to work in a car factory. It could be reprogrammed for different tasks.\n\n**Example:** Unimate was like a giant robot arm that could pick up hot metal parts that would burn human workers.\n\n\n\n"
