Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HNC Interior Design Student\n\n## Core Demographics\n- No prior formal interior design training\n- Adult (18+) with completed secondary education\n- Career-changer with diverse professional background\n- Basic computer literacy\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Obtaining HNC qualification for entry-level interior design positions\n- Developing industry-relevant technical skills\n- Building a preliminary professional portfolio\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- Has: Basic math, English proficiency (B2), computer fundamentals\n- Needs: Technical drawing, space planning, CAD software, professional communication, project workflow management\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Thrives with hands-on, practical application of concepts\n- Benefits from structured guidance transitioning to self-direction\n- Requires regular, constructive feedback\n- Learns best through tangible outcomes and application\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Building technical design competencies from beginner level\n- Adapting to professional standards and expectations\n- Developing organizational discipline and documentation habits\n- Balancing creative aspirations with technical requirements\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Structured, progressive skill-building exercises\n- Clear connections between theory and practical application\n- Scaffolded learning with decreasing guidance\n- Opportunities for reflection and self-assessment\n- Industry-relevant examples and scenarios\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# Multiple-Choice Test: Design Analysis and Project Planning\n\n## Question 1\nWhen brands update their logos, which of the following is NOT typically a primary reason for the redesign?\n\nA) To maintain relevance and reflect evolving brand identity\nB) To improve visibility and adaptability in digital spaces\nC) To completely abandon their existing customer base\nD) To signal growth, innovation, or shifts in direction\n\n**Correct Answer: C**\n\n**Explanation:** Brands update logos to stay relevant and connect with both existing and new audiences, not to abandon their current customers.
