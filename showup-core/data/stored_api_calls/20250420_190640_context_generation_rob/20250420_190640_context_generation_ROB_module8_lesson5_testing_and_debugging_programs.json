Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

In fact, professional programmers spend a lot of their time finding and fixing problems in their code! This podcast discusses how having a step-by-step plan for finding bugs (errors) in your code can save you time and frustration. \n\nJust like a doctor uses a systematic approach to figure out why someone is sick, programmers use debugging techniques to diagnose what's wrong with their code. By following a clear process instead of making random changes, you can solve problems more quickly and learn from your mistakes.\n\n## Common Programming Errors\nWhen programming robots to help people, even small errors can cause the robot to behave unexpectedly. Understanding common errors will help you identify and fix them more efficiently.\n\n### Syntax Errors\nSyntax errors occur when your code doesn't follow the programming language's rules. These are typically caught by the programming environment before the program runs.\n\nExamples include:\n- Missing punctuation (forgetting semicolons or brackets)\n- Misspelled commands or variable names\n- Incorrect capitalization in languages that are case-sensitive\n\nThink of syntax errors like spelling or grammar mistakes in writing. The computer can't understand what you're trying to say because you're not following the rules of the language. The good news is that most programming tools will point out these errors with underlines or error messages to help you fix them quickly.\n\n### Logic Errors\nLogic errors are more challenging to identify because the program runs without crashing, but doesn't behave as expected.\n\nExamples include:\n- Using the wrong mathematical operator (+ instead of -)\n- Creating infinite loops that never terminate\n- Setting incorrect values for variables\n- Writing conditions that never evaluate as expected\n\nLogic errors are like giving someone directions to your house but accidentally telling them to turn left when they should turn right. The person follows your instructions exactly, but ends up in the wrong place! These errors can be tricky because the computer doesn't know what you intended - it just follows your instructions precisely.\n\n### Runtime Errors\nRuntime errors occur while the program is running and often cause it to crash.\n\nExamples include:\n- Dividing by zero\n- Accessing undefined variables\n- Attempting to use resources that don't exist\n- Memory overflow errors\n\nRuntime errors happen when your program tries to do something impossible during execution. Imagine telling a robot to pick up an object that isn't there or asking it to move through a wall. The robot can't complete the task and has to stop. Similarly, when your program encounters a runtime error, it usually stops running and displays an error message explaining what went wrong.\n\n## The Debugging Process\nDebugging is a systematic approach to finding and fixing errors in your code. Following a structured process makes troubleshooting more efficient.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nBefore attempting to fix an issue, clearly identify:\n- What is the robot currently doing?\n- What should the robot be doing instead?\n- When exactly does the problem occur?\n\nThis first step is crucial because you can't fix a problem if you don't understand it. Take time to observe exactly what's happening. For example, if your robot is supposed to follow a line but keeps veering off to the right, make note of exactly when and how this happens. Does it happen immediately or after a certain amount of time? Does it happen on straight sections or only on curves?\n\n### Step 2: Reproduce the Error\nCreate a reliable way to make the error happen consistently. You can't fix what you can't see.\n\nIf you can make the error happen every time under specific conditions, you'll be able to test whether your fix actually works. For example, if your robot only crashes when it tries to turn left, create a simple test program that makes it turn left repeatedly. This helps you focus on the specific part of the code that's causing problems.\n\n### Step 3: Isolate the Issue\nNarrow down where in your code the problem is occurring:\n- Use print statements to show variable values\n- Comment out sections of code to identify which part causes the problem\n- Check one piece of functionality at a time\n\nThis step is like being a detective. You're gathering clues about what might be causing the problem. Print statements are especially helpful because they let you see what's happening inside your program as it runs. For example, if your robot is turning at the wrong angle, you could add print statements to show what angle value the program is calculating.\n\n### Step 4: Fix and Test\nMake one change at a time and test after each change to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nIt's important to make just one change at a time. If you change multiple things and the problem is fixed, you won't know which change actually solved it! After each change, run your program to see if the error still occurs. Keep track of what you've tried so you don't repeat the same attempts.\n\n## **Activity 1: Find the Bug**\nReview the following robot navigation program that should guide a helper robot through a room to deliver medicine to a patient, but it's not working correctly:\n\n\nfunction navigateToPatient(startPosition, patientPosition):\n    current = startPosition\n    path = []\n    \n    while current != patientPosition:\n        if current.x < patientPosition.x:\n            current.x += 1\n        else if current.x > patientPosition.x:\n            current.x -= 1\n        if current.y < patientPosition.y:\n            current.y += 1\n        else if current.y > patientPosition.y:\n            current.y -= 1\n        path.append(current)\n    \n    return path\n\n\nIdentify the error in this code and determine how to fix it. Hint: The robot sometimes gets stuck moving in only one direction.\n\n## Testing with Different Scenarios\nThorough testing is essential for creating reliable robot programs that help people safely.\n\n### Edge Cases\nTest your program with unusual or extreme inputs:\n- What happens if the robot is asked to navigate to its current position?\n- What if it needs to move a very long distance?\n- What if obstacles are present?\n\nEdge cases are special situations that might not happen often but could cause big problems if not handled correctly. For example, what if someone accidentally tells your delivery robot to bring medicine to room 999, but your building only has 10 rooms? A good program should recognize this impossible request and respond appropriately instead of malfunctioning.\n\nTesting edge cases helps make your robot more reliable in unexpected situations. Think about what might happen in rare or unusual circumstances, and make sure your program can handle these situations gracefully.\n\n### User Scenarios\nTest your program based on real-world situations:\n- How would different users interact with the robot?\n- What if the user gives unexpected commands?\n- What if the environment changes while the robot is operating?\n\nUser scenario testing means thinking about how real people will use your robot in the real world. For example, if you're programming a robot to help elderly people, you might need to make the interface extra simple and provide clear feedback. If children might interact with the robot, you should make sure it responds safely to unpredictable commands.\n\nConsider different environments too. A robot that works perfectly in your classroom might struggle in a busy hospital hallway or a home with pets running around. Testing with realistic scenarios helps ensure your robot will be helpful in actual use.\n\n### Systematic Testing\nCreate a testing plan that covers all possible scenarios:\n- Start with simple, known inputs\n- Progress to more complex cases\n- Document results to track improvements\n\nSystematic testing means having an organized plan to test your program thoroughly. Start with basic tests that you know should work, like having your robot move forward 10 centimeters. Once those pass, try more complicated tests like navigating through a simple maze.\n\nKeep a record of what you've tested and the results. This helps you track your progress and avoid repeating tests unnecessarily. It also helps you remember what worked and what didn't if you need to make changes later.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you encountered a problem with a device or application. How did you go about troubleshooting it? Did you follow steps similar to the debugging process we discussed?\n\n## Improving Your Programs\nOnce your program works correctly, you can focus on making it better.\n\n### Code Readability\nClear, well-organized code is easier to debug:\n- Use meaningful variable and function names\n- Add comments explaining complex sections\n- Format your code consistently\n\nWriting readable code is like writing a clear essay instead of a messy note. When you use descriptive names like \"robotSpeed\" instead of just \"s\", anyone reading your code (including your future self!) will understand what it means. Comments are like footnotes that explain your thinking and help others understand tricky parts of your code.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n```\nx = 5\ny = x * 2\n```\n\nYou could write:\n```\n// Set the robot's maximum speed\nmaxSpeed = 5\n// Calculate safe turning speed (half of maximum)\nturningSpeed = maxSpeed * 2\n```\n\nThis makes it much easier to understand what your code is doing and why.\n\n### Defensive Programming\nAnticipate potential problems in your code:\n- Validate user inputs before processing them\n- Include error handling for unexpected situations\n- Add safeguards for critical operations\n\nDefensive programming is like wearing a helmet when riding a bike - it's about protecting your program from things that might go wrong. For example, if your program asks for a number between 1 and 10, check that the input is actually a number and is within that range before using it.\n\nError handling means your program can respond gracefully when something unexpected happens. Instead of crashing when a sensor fails, your robot could display a message saying \"Sensor error detected\" and safely stop moving until the problem is fixed.\n\n#### Graceful Degradation\nAn important part of defensive programming is graceful degradation - making sure your robot can still function in a limited way even when something goes wrong.\n\nFor example, if your kitchen helper robot has three sensors to detect obstacles but one stops working:\n- A poorly programmed robot might crash or freeze completely\n- A robot with graceful degradation would display a warning message, move more slowly, and continue working with the remaining sensors\n\nThis is like how your phone can still make calls even when the internet isn't working. Your robot should have backup plans for when things don't go perfectly!\n\n### Incremental Development\nBuild and test your program in small pieces:\n- Start with a minimal working version\n- Add one feature at a time\n- Test thoroughly after each addition\n\nIncremental development means building your program step by step instead of all at once. It's like building with blocks - you make sure each piece is solid before adding the next one. For example, when programming a helper robot, you might:\n\n1. First make sure it can move forward and stop safely\n2. Then add turning capabilities\n3. Then add object detection\n4. Finally add the specific helper functions\n\nThis approach makes it much easier to find and fix problems because you know exactly what changed when something stops working.\n\n## **Activity 2: Test Different Inputs**\nTake the corrected robot navigation program from the earlier activity and test it with these different scenarios:\n\n1. Starting and ending positions are the same\n2. The robot needs to navigate around a simple obstacle\n3. The destination is unreachable\n\nFor each scenario, predict what will happen, run the test, and record the results. What changes would you make to improve the program's handling of these situations?\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how systematic debugging differs from random trial-and-error approaches. How does having a structured debugging process help you solve programming problems more efficiently? Think about how this might apply to other types of problem-solving beyond programming.\n\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhat is the first step in debugging a program that isn't working?\nA. Start over with a new program\nB. Ask someone else to fix it\nC. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen\nD. Add more code to fix the problem\n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen. Effective debugging starts with clearly understanding the problem by identifying the difference between the current behavior and the expected behavior. If you chose a different answer, remember that fixing a problem requires first understanding it thoroughly - adding code blindly or starting over are inefficient approaches when a systematic process can help identify the specific issue.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Debugging is a normal part of programming that becomes easier with practice and a systematic approach\n- Systematic testing with various inputs helps uncover and address potential problems before they affect users\n- Small, incremental tests and changes make debugging easier and help create more reliable programs\n\n## Instructional designer notes of lesson 8.5\n**This lesson fits into the overall module of Robots Helping People in the following ways:**\n- It provides essential troubleshooting skills needed for programming reliable robot assistants\n- It emphasizes the importance of thorough testing when robots interact with humans\n- It builds on previous programming concepts by focusing on quality and reliability\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nDebug challenge where students compete to identify and fix errors in provided programs. For example, students could be given a robot assistance program with 5-7 deliberately placed errors (syntax, logic, and runtime). They must identify all errors, explain the problem, and provide the correct solution within a time limit. Points would be awarded for speed, accuracy of fixes, and quality of explanations.\n</CONTENT>\n",
