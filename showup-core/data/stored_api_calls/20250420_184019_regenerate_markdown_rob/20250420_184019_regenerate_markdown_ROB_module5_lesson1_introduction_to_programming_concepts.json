They can hold numbers, text, or more complex data. In robotics, variables might store sensor readings, motor speeds, or position coordinates.\n### **Conditions**\n\nConditions allow programs to make decisions based on certain criteria. \"If-then-else\" statements help robots respond differently depending on their environment.\nProgramming involves several core concepts that appear across different programming languages:\n### **Loops**\n\nLoops allow programs to repeat actions multiple times.

  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for proper HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\n\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs. A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n### 3. Page Break Markers\n\nInsert `---pagebreak---` markers at logical page breaks in the document where it makes sense for PDF printing.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics\nThis chapter covers the basic concepts of robotics, including definitions, history, and key components.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Chapter 2: Robot Sensors\nThis chapter explores the various types of sensors used in robotics.\n```\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\nNote that each question and each answer option MUST be separated by an empty line for proper HTML rendering.\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Identify major section transitions where a page break would be appropriate\n2. Focus on these key locations:\n   - Between major sections or chapters\n   - After complete topic areas\n   - Where content naturally transitions to a new concept\n   - Before or after large diagrams or image descriptions\n3. Use page breaks sparingly - when in doubt, use fewer page breaks\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense for printing\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance.\nAnother misconception is that all robots are autonomous. In reality, many robots require continuous human control and are not capable of making decisions on their own.\n\n## Types of Robot Control Systems\nThere are several methods for controlling robots, from direct manual control to fully autonomous operation.\n```\n\n**Transformed:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

These instructions, called **code**, are written in special languages that computers can understand. In essence, programming is how we communicate with machines to make them do what we want.\n\n### **Core Programming Principles**\n\n**Programming** follows several fundamental principles:\n- **Precision**: Unlike human communication, programming requires exact instructions\n- **Logic**: Instructions follow logical patterns and sequences\n\n## **Programming in the Input-Processing-Output Framework**\n\nThe **input-processing-output (IPO) framework** provides a clear way to understand how programming works, especially in robotics:\n\n### **Robotics Application**\n\nIn robotics, this framework comes to life:\n- **Input**: Sensors detect the environment (light sensors, touch sensors, cameras)\n- **Processing**: The robot's program interprets the sensor data and decides what to do\n- **Output**: The program produces results based on the processing, which might be movement, displays, sounds, or other actions\n\n### **Real-World Example: School Security System**\n\nLet's look at how the input-processing-output framework works in a school security system:\n\nThis framework helps us visualize how robots interact with their environment through our programming instructions.\n\nThis same framework applies whether we're programming a simple robot that follows a line or a complex robot that navigates a building.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Key Programming Concepts**\n\nProgramming involves several core concepts that appear across different programming languages:\n\n### **Variables**\n\n**Variables** are like containers that store information. They can hold numbers, text, or more complex data. In robotics, variables might store sensor readings, motor speeds, or position coordinates.\n\n### **Conditions**\n\n**Conditions** allow programs to make decisions based on certain criteria. \"If-then-else\" statements help robots respond differently depending on their environment.\n\n### **Loops**\n\n**Loops** allow programs to repeat actions multiple times. They're essential for tasks that require repetition without writing the same code over and over.\n- Example: A loop might make a robot check its distance sensor repeatedly while moving forward.\n\n### **Functions**\n\n**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help organize code and prevent repetition.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## **Stop and reflect**\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the last time you gave someone directions to complete a task. How clear and precise were your instructions? Consider how the person might have misinterpreted your directions if they were ambiguous, much like a robot would fail to execute imprecise programming instructions.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Introduction to Block-Based Programming**\n\n**Block-based programming** provides a visual approach to coding that's especially helpful for beginners:\n\n### **Visual Programming Environment**\n\nInstead of typing text commands, block-based programming lets you drag and drop colorful blocks that represent different programming instructions. These blocks fit together like puzzle pieces, making it easy to see how code flows.\n\n### **Benefits for Learning**\n\n- **Reduced syntax errors**: Blocks only fit together in ways that make logical sense\n- **Visual feedback**: You can see the structure of your program at a glance\n- **Focus on concepts**: You can learn programming logic without worrying about typos or punctuation\n- **Immediate testing**: Many block environments let you run your code instantly to see results\n\n### **Examples in Robotics**\n\nSeveral platforms use block-based programming for robotics:\n- LEGO MINDSTORMS\n- VEX Blocks\n- micro:bit MakeCode\n\nThese platforms make it easier to start programming robots without extensive coding knowledge.\n\n## **Programming Challenges in the Real World**\n\nWhen programming robots, engineers face several challenges:\n\n### **Dealing with Unpredictable Environments**\n\nUnlike computers that operate in controlled settings, robots interact with the real world, which can be unpredictable:\n\n### **From Code to Action: Bridging the Gap**\n\nSometimes a robot doesn't move exactly as programmed because:\n- Motors might not be perfectly matched in strength\n- Sensors might give slightly different readings each time\n- Physical parts like wheels can wear down over time\n\nProgrammers solve these problems by:\n- Calibrating sensors regularly\n- Testing programs in different conditions\n- Adding code that can adjust to small differences in how the robot performs\n\n![Robot Programming Diagram](https://example.com/robot_programming_diagram.jpg)\n*This diagram shows how programming instructions translate to physical robot actions*\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich of the following best describes programming in the context of robotics?\n\nA. Writing code in any language\n\nB. Creating art with computers\n\nC. Giving precise instructions that connect inputs to outputs\n\nD. Making websites\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is C. Giving precise instructions that connect inputs to outputs. Programming in robotics is about creating instructions that tell the robot how to process inputs and create appropriate outputs. If you chose a different answer, remember that while programming can involve writing code (A), creating digital art (B), or making websites (D), in robotics specifically it's about creating the instructions that allow robots to interpret their environment and respond appropriately.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---"
