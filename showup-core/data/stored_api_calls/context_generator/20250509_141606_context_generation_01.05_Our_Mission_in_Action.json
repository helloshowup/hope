Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Unified Target Learner Profile  \n**Excel Education Systems (Grades 6–12)**\n\n## GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\n- **Age Range:** 11–18 years old, covering middle and high school grades (6–12).\n- **Enrollment Type:** Students are enrolled full- or part-time in an accredited, asynchronous online learning environment.\n- **Learning Format:** All courses are asynchronous and self-paced, requiring students to work independently and manage their own schedules.\n- **Geographic Reach:** Students are globally distributed, participating from diverse countries and time zones.\n- **Language:** Instruction is in English.

  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module that introduces and explains Excel High School's mission statement. It covers the key elements of the mission, how the mission is reflected in student support services and programs, and how students can connect the mission to their personal educational goals. The content is structured around learning objectives, an overview of the mission statement, real-world examples, and a guided exercise for students to create their own personalized success plan.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests the addition of two paragraphs to the \"Student Success Stories\" and \"Support Systems That Reflect Our Mission\" sections to make the content flow more naturally and avoid an overly \"AI-like\" writing style. The prompt also emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document, as well as preserving all special marker tags.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are middle and high school students (ages 11-18) enrolled in Excel High School's asynchronous online learning environment. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Reading level: Use plain language with short sentences, aiming for a 5th-6th grade reading level for younger students and progressively increasing complexity for high schoolers.\n- Engagement: Break content into manageable chunks and favor visual, interactive elements like diagrams, examples, and videos to maintain interest.\n- Flexibility: Design activities that can be completed with minimal materials and adapted for small or shared learning spaces.\n- Cultural sensitivity: Ensure examples and references are inclusive and widely understandable for a globally distributed student population.\n- Self-management: Provide clear task directions and explicit objectives to support students' independent learning and time management.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nAs an asynchronous online course, the content must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without daily external supervision. This includes:\n\n- Avoiding overly complex formatting or structural changes that could disrupt the flow of the self-guided module.\n- Ensuring all resources and support systems referenced are accessible and functional within the online learning environment.\n- Designing activities that can be completed using common devices and software available to students, without requiring specialized equipment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose and structure of the existing content, which effectively introduces Excel High School's mission and guides students in connecting it to their personal goals.\n- Enhance the \"Student Success Stories\" and \"Support Systems\" sections to improve the narrative flow and make the content more engaging for the target audience, while maintaining the overall tone and style.\n- Ensure the enhanced content continues to provide a clear, actionable framework for students to create their own personalized success plan.\n- Avoid making significant changes to the formatting or organization of the module, as this could disrupt the self-guided nature of the asynchronous online learning experience.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Analyze the current \"Student Success Stories\" and \"Support Systems\" sections to identify opportunities for adding transitional paragraphs that bridge the existing content more seamlessly.\n2. Craft new paragraphs that:\n   - Maintain the instructional tone and technical depth of the surrounding text\n   - Highlight relevant student success stories and support services in a compelling, narrative style\n   - Connect these examples back to the school's mission and how they benefit the target learners\n3. Ensure the new paragraphs flow logically with the existing content and preserve the document's formatting and structure.\n4. Review the enhanced content to verify it meets the requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt, including preserving all special marker tags.\n\nThe goal of this enhancement is to improve the narrative quality and engagement of the content while preserving its core educational value and alignment with the target learner profile. The resulting module should provide a cohesive, learner-centered introduction to Excel High School's mission and how students can leverage the school's resources to achieve their personal goals."
