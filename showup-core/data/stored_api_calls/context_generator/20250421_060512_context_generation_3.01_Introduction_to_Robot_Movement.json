Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

When we see a robot move, we're witnessing its ability to change its position or the position of its parts to accomplish tasks. Think about it - without movement, many robots would simply be stationary computers!\n\nMovement gives robots the power to interact with the world around them. Whether it's a robot arm assembling a car part, a drone delivering a package, or a robot vacuum cleaning your home, movement is what allows these machines to be useful in our daily lives.\n\nThe ability to move is what transforms a simple computer into a machine that can physically change its environment. This is why movement is considered such a fundamental part of what makes many robots truly robotic.\n\n### **Why Robots Need to Move**\n\nRobots need to move for many different reasons, all connected to their specific jobs or purposes. Here are some of the main reasons:\n\nFirst, robots often need to move to complete tasks. A delivery robot must travel from one location to another. A manufacturing robot arm needs to reach, grab, and place objects. Even a simple educational robot like Sphero needs to roll around to draw shapes or navigate mazes.\n\nSecond, movement allows robots to explore and gather information about their surroundings. Mars rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance move across the Martian surface to study different areas and collect samples. Robot vacuums move around your home to find and clean dirty spots.\n\nThird, movement enables robots to adapt to changing environments. Search and rescue robots need to navigate through disaster areas that may be constantly changing. Agricultural robots must move through fields with varying terrain and plant growth.\n\n### **Moving vs. Non-Moving Robots**\n\nNot all robots need to move to be useful. Some robots are designed to stay in one place, while others need mobility to fulfill their purpose.\n\nStationary robots include industrial robot arms that are fixed to a specific spot on a factory floor. These robots can move their arms and tools with incredible precision, but the base of the robot remains in place. Other examples include automated teller machines (ATMs), which process banking transactions without needing to move locations, and some smart home devices like voice assistants.\n\nMoving robots, on the other hand, change their location to perform their tasks. Examples include self-driving cars, delivery drones, robot vacuums, and exploration robots. Their ability to navigate through space is essential to their function. A delivery robot that couldn't move would be useless for its intended purpose!\n\nThe choice between a moving or non-moving design depends entirely on what the robot needs to accomplish. A robot surgeon needs precise arm movements but doesn't need to travel around the hospital. A warehouse robot, however, must be able to travel throughout the facility to retrieve items.\n\n## **Activity 1: Robot Movement Classification**\nStudents sort images of various robots based on whether they move or not, then categorize moving robots by purpose and movement type. Consider how each robot's movement capability relates to its function and what would happen if that movement capability was removed.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots move to complete tasks, explore their surroundings, and adapt to changing environments.\n- Some robots are designed to stay in one place (like factory arms), while others need to move around (like delivery robots) to fulfill their purpose.\n- A robot's movement capabilities directly connect to its job - the right type of movement helps the robot accomplish its specific tasks.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
