Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

The best power source depends on what the robot needs to do, where it will work, and how long it needs to run without recharging or refueling.\n\nBatteries are the most common way to power robots that move around because they store energy that can be used anywhere. Here are some types of batteries used in robotics:\n\nLithium-ion batteries are popular in many robots because they hold a lot of energy in a small, light package. These are the same batteries used in cell phones and laptops. They can be recharged hundreds of times and give steady power. But they can be expensive and might get too hot if damaged.\n\nAlkaline batteries (like AA or AAA batteries) are sometimes used in simple or school robots. They're cheap and easy to find but can't be recharged and don't last very long for robots that need a lot of power.\n\nLead-acid batteries, like the ones in cars, are heavier but cheaper than lithium-ion. They're often used in bigger robots that don't need to be very light, such as some robot lawnmowers.\n\nScientists are always creating newer battery types. For example, solid-state batteries promise to be safer and hold more energy than today's lithium-ion batteries. Some test robots even use biological batteries that work like how living things make energy!\n\n### **Direct Power Connections**\n\nSome robots don't use batteries at all - instead, they plug right into a power outlet. These robots are called \"tethered\" because they're connected by a power cord.\n\nTethered robots have some big advantages. They never run out of power and can work non-stop for as long as needed. They can also use parts that need more power since they don't have to save battery life. Factory robots that work in the same spot all day often use direct power connections.\n\nThe main downside is clear - they can't move around much! A tethered robot can only go as far as its power cord reaches. This makes tethered power best for robots that stay in one place or work in a small area. The cord can also get in the way or become tangled.\n\nSome robots use a mix of both approaches, running on battery power but automatically going back to a charging station when their batteries get low. This gives them freedom to move while fixing the problem of limited battery life.\n\n### **Alternative and Renewable Power Sources**\n\nEngineers are developing cool new ways to power robots that are better for the environment and can work in faraway places:\n\nSolar-powered robots use panels that turn sunlight into electricity. These robots can possibly work for very long times in sunny places without needing to recharge. NASA's Mars rovers use solar panels to power their exploration of the red planet. The drawback is that they need sunlight to work well.\n\nFuel cells make electricity through chemical reactions, often using hydrogen. They can provide more power than batteries of the same weight and can be refilled quickly. Some test delivery robots use fuel cells to work longer between charges.\n\nEnergy harvesting technologies let robots generate power from their surroundings. This might include collecting energy from the robot's own movements, temperature differences, or even from radio waves in the air. While these methods usually don't make much power, they can help a robot work longer.\n\nWireless power transfer is a new technology that lets robots get power without being plugged in. Special charging pads or stations send energy through the air, which the robot can collect. This technology is still being developed but could someday allow robots to charge automatically as they work.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** How might a robot's power source limit or expand its potential applications? Consider a robot designed for deep sea exploration - what power constraints would it face and how would these constraints affect its design and functionality?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- A robot's power source affects where it can work and for how long - batteries allow robots to move freely but eventually need recharging, while plugged-in robots can work non-stop but can't move far.\n- Different robot jobs need different power sources - small indoor robots typically use batteries, factory robots that stay in one place use direct power connections, and outdoor robots might use solar power.\n- Engineers are creating new ways to power robots that don't need to be plugged in or have batteries changed, like solar panels and systems that collect energy from the environment.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n</CONTENT>\n",
