Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\n# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary fitness terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new exercise or activity\n- Use diagrams to show proper body positions and form\n- Add labeled illustrations for exercise variations and modifications\n- Include visual examples of completed activities\n- Provide clear visual representations of safety considerations\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make fitness concepts relatable\n- Create achievable challenges that can be done in various home environments\n\n### Equipment and Space Considerations\n- Provide alternatives using common household items\n- Include adaptations for small spaces (apartment, bedroom, hallway)\n- Design activities with minimal noise impact for shared living spaces\n- Offer variations for different surfaces (carpet, hard floor, outdoors)\n- Suggest creative solutions for tracking progress without specialized equipment\n\n### Safety Guidelines\n- Provide clear safety warnings for each activity\n- Include detailed warm-up and cool-down instructions\n- Offer modified versions for different physical abilities\n- Emphasize proper form over speed or repetitions\n- Include guidance for when to stop an activity if discomfort occurs\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n- Include printable tracking sheets with simple, clear layouts\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"Cardiovascular endurance activities enhance pulmonary efficiency, enabling sustained physical exertion through improved oxygen utilization across multiple muscle groups.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"Cardio exercises make your heart and lungs stronger.
