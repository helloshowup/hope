The secret is balance. A good workout routine includes warming up, building strength, improving flexibility, and cooling down properly. This guide will help you create a workout plan that's safe, effective, and tailored to your fitness level.\n\n## Warm-Up (5 minutes)\nYour warm-up is like the first few minutes of waking up in the morning—your body needs time to get going. A proper warm-up:\n- Increases your heart rate through light activities like jogging in place, jumping jacks, or dancing\n- Activates your muscles with arm circles, leg swings, and gentle twists\n- Prepares your joints with ankle rotations and knee lifts\n- Should last about 3-5 minutes, involving your whole body\n\nRemember: Skipping your warm-up is asking for trouble. It helps prevent injuries and makes the rest of your workout more effective.\n\n## Strength Training (10-15 minutes)\nNow for the part that builds muscle power. Strength training improves your posture, makes you stronger, and boosts your metabolism (how efficiently your body uses energy). Try these bodyweight exercises:\n\n- Push-ups (regular or modified on your knees)\n- Squats (imagine sitting down in an invisible chair)\n- Lunges (stepping forward and bending both knees)\n- Plank holds (keeping your body straight like a board)\n- Superman lifts (lying on your stomach and lifting arms and legs)\n\nAim for 2 sets of 10-15 repetitions of each exercise with 30-60 seconds rest between sets. If something feels too easy, try a harder version. If it's too challenging, use an easier modification.\n\n## Flexibility (5-10 minutes)\nStretching keeps your muscles and joints healthy and helps with everyday movement. When stretching:\n- Hold each position for 20-30 seconds without bouncing\n- Breathe deeply throughout\n- Feel a gentle pull, but never pain\n\nTry these stretches:\n- Hamstring stretch (reach for your toes while sitting)\n- Quad stretch (pull your foot toward your bottom while standing)\n- Butterfly stretch (sit with soles of feet together)\n- Arm across chest stretch (for shoulders)\n- Child's pose (kneel and reach forward with arms)\n\n## Cool-Down (2-3 minutes)\nThink of your cool-down like gradually slowing down on a bike rather than slamming on the brakes. It helps your heart rate return to normal and prevents dizziness. Your cool-down should include:\n- Slow walking or gentle marching in place\n- Deep breathing exercises (in through nose, out through mouth)\n- Light stretching of any tight muscles\n- A moment to notice how your body feels after exercise\n\n## Sample Workout for Beginners\nHere's a complete workout you can try right away in your own space:\n\n**Warm-Up (5 minutes)**\n- 1 minute: March in place\n- 1 minute: Arm circles (forward and backward)\n- 1 minute: High knees (lifting knees toward chest)\n- 1 minute: Leg swings (front to back, side to side)\n- 1 minute: Jumping jacks\n\n**Strength Training (10 minutes)**\n- 2 sets of 10 modified push-ups (rest 30 seconds between sets)\n- 2 sets of 12 squats (rest 30 seconds between sets)\n- 2 sets of 10 lunges (5 each leg, rest 30 seconds between sets)\n- 2 sets of 20-second plank holds (rest 30 seconds between sets)\n\n**Flexibility (5 minutes)**\n- Hamstring stretch (30 seconds each leg)\n- Quad stretch (30 seconds each leg)\n- Shoulder stretch (30 seconds each arm)\n- Lower back stretch (30 seconds)\n\n**Cool-Down (3 minutes)**\n- 1 minute: Slow walking in place\n- 1 minute: Deep breathing with arm raises\n- 1 minute: Gentle neck and shoulder rolls\n\n## Tracking Your Progress\nKeeping a workout log helps you see your improvements. In your personal log, note:\n- Which exercises you did\n- How many sets and repetitions you completed\n- How difficult the workout felt on a scale of 1-10 (where 1 is dead easy and 10 is nearly impossible)\n\nAim for a difficulty level of 5-7 out of 10. If your workout feels like a 4 or below, it's time to make it more challenging. If it feels like an 8 or above, you might need to dial it back a bit.\n\n## Over to You\nThink about your favourite physical activities. How could you incorporate them into a balanced workout routine? What parts of your body would you most like to strengthen or make more flexible? Create your own 15-minute workout plan that includes all four components. You can use items around your home like water bottles for weights or a sturdy chair for support.\n\nYou now know how to create a balanced workout that covers all the bases: warm-up, strength training, flexibility, and cool-down. The best workout is one you'll actually do regularly, so choose activities you enjoy. Start with the sample workout, then design your own routine. Your body will thank you, and you'll feel stronger, more flexible, and more energised day by day.\n</CONTENT>\n",
