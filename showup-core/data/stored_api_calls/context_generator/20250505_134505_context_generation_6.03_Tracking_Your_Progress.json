Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

That's exactly why tracking fitness matters. When you record your activities, you can actually see your improvements, which feels awesome and keeps you going. You'll also develop self-awareness and goal-setting skills that help in school, sports, and other areas of your life.\n\n## Why Track Your Progress?\n\nTracking your fitness turns exercise from something you just do into something you can actually measure and feel good about. Plus, when you write things down or record them, your brain pays more attention to what you're doing, which helps you make better choices about staying active.\n\nTracking what you do during workouts helps you know where you started and how far you've come. Here's why it's worth doing:\n\n- **See Your Improvements**: Looking back at your records shows how much stronger or faster you've become\n- **Stay Motivated**: Seeing your progress makes it easier to keep exercising, especially on tough days\n- **Set Better Goals**: Your records help you create realistic targets based on what you've already done\n- **Build Confidence**: Nothing beats the feeling of looking back and seeing how much you've improved\n\n## Simple Ways to Track Progress\n\n### Fitness Journal\n\nA fitness journal is like keeping a diary, but instead of writing about your day or your feelings, you're writing about your workouts. Many professional athletes keep training journals! You don't need anything fancy - just a notebook or even a notes app on your phone works great. The cool thing about a journal is you can look back weeks or months later and actually see how much stronger or faster you've gotten.\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n- Find a notebook or create a digital document on your computer/tablet\n- Divide each page into sections: Date, Exercise, Duration, Intensity, and Notes\n- Keep your journal somewhere visible (like on your desk or bedside table)\n\n**What to Record:**\n- The specific exercises you did (example: \"10 push-ups, 15 squats, 5-minute jog\")\n- How long you exercised (example: \"20 minutes total\")\n- How you felt during and after (example: \"Legs tired but happy I finished\")\n- Any achievements (example: \"Did 2 more push-ups than yesterday\")\n\n**Example Journal Entry:**\n```\nDate: October 15\nExercise: Jump rope, Push-ups, Stretching\nDuration: 15 minutes\nIntensity: Medium (3/5)\nNotes: Jump rope felt easier today! Did 50 jumps without stopping.\n```\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you forget to record for a day, just start again the next day\n- If writing feels like too much work, try voice recording your notes\n- For younger students: Drawing pictures of the exercises works too!\n\n### Calendar Method\n\nUsing a calendar to track your fitness is super simple and gives you a big-picture view of how active you are. It's kind of like those sticker charts from elementary school, but for fitness! The best part is seeing all those colorful marks add up over time. When you look at your calendar and see lots of colors, it's a quick reminder that you're building healthy habits. Plus, it's really satisfying to add a new sticker or mark after a good workout!\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n- Use a wall calendar, printable calendar sheet, or digital calendar app\n- Gather 4 different colored markers, stickers, or digital icons\n- Create a color key at the bottom of your calendar\n\n**Tracking System:**\n- Blue = walks, runs, or cardio activities\n- Red = strength exercises (push-ups, sit-ups)\n- Green = sports or active play\n- Yellow = personal best or milestone achieved\n\n**How to Evaluate:**\n- Count the total number of active days each week\n- Look for the most common color to see what type of exercise you do most\n- Set a goal to increase your active days each week\n\n**Example Goal:** \"This week I'll aim for at least 4 colored dots on my calendar.\"\n\n### Milestone-Based Fitness Checks\n\nMilestone tracking is perfect if you like to challenge yourself and celebrate specific achievements. It's like leveling up in real life! Instead of focusing on daily workouts, you're aiming to reach certain fitness abilities - like being able to hold a plank longer or run without stopping. The great thing about milestones is they give you clear targets to aim for, and when you reach one, it feels amazing! You can even take a victory selfie or video when you hit a milestone to remember your achievement.\n\nInstead of timed tests, try these milestone checks whenever you feel ready:\n\n**Beginner Level:**\n- Push-up milestone: Complete 5 good-form push-ups (from knees is fine)\n- Plank milestone: Hold a plank for 20 seconds\n- Movement milestone: Walk/jog without stopping for 5 minutes\n- Flexibility milestone: Touch your toes while sitting with legs extended\n\n**Intermediate Level:**\n- Push-up milestone: Complete 10 good-form push-ups\n- Plank milestone: Hold a plank for 45 seconds\n- Movement milestone: Jog without stopping for 10 minutes\n- Flexibility milestone: Hold a butterfly stretch for 30 seconds\n\n**Advanced Level:**\n- Push-up milestone: Complete 15+ good-form push-ups\n- Plank milestone: Hold a plank for 60+ seconds\n- Movement milestone: Run without stopping for 15+ minutes\n- Flexibility milestone: Touch palms to the floor in a standing forward bend\n\n**Recording Your Milestones:**\nCreate a milestone tracker with:\n\n- Date you attempted the milestone\n- Whether you achieved it (Yes/No)\n- Notes on how it felt\n- Date to try again if not achieved\n\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities. ask them to consider the thee tracking options.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n## Celebrating Your Progress\n\nDon't just track your progress - celebrate it! Think about it: when you work hard on something, it feels great to be recognized. The same goes for your fitness journey. Taking a moment to celebrate tells your brain \"Hey, this is important!\" which makes you more likely to keep going. Even small celebrations - like putting a gold star on your calendar or texting a family member about your achievement - can give you a boost of motivation that lasts for days.\n\nTaking time to recognize your improvements is important! Try these ideas:\n\n- Create a \"Fitness Wins\" section in your journal where you record each milestone\n- Take a photo when you reach a goal (like touching your toes or doing your first push-up)\n- Design a reward system (example: \"After 10 active days, I get to pick a movie for family night\")\n- Make a progress chart for your wall with stickers for each achievement\n\n## Activity: Create Your Tracking System\n\n**Step 1: Choose Your Method**\nLook at the tracking options and pick one that feels right for you:\n\n- Fitness Journal (great for writing details and thoughts)\n- Calendar Method (perfect if you like visual reminders)\n- Milestone Tracking (ideal if you love reaching specific goals)\n- Rating System (helpful for figuring out which exercises you enjoy most)\n\n**Step 2: Gather Materials**\nFor a Fitness Journal:\n\n- Notebook OR digital document\n- Pen/pencil OR device for typing\n- Ruler for making sections (optional)\n\nFor a Calendar Method:\n\n- Calendar (wall, desk, or printable) OR calendar app\n- Colored markers/stickers OR digital icons\n- Tape to hang it somewhere visible (if using paper)\n\nFor Milestone Tracking:\n\n- Tracking sheet (create using paper or digital document)\n- List of appropriate milestones for your fitness level\n\nFor Rating System:\n\n- Rating sheets (create or print multiple copies)\n- Folder or envelope to store completed sheets\n\n**Step 3: Set Up Your System**\n1. Prepare your chosen tracking tool using the setup instructions above\n2. Complete the first entry as practice\n3. Place your tracking tool somewhere you'll see it daily\n4. Schedule a regular time to update your tracker (after exercise or before bed)\n\n**Step 4: Set Specific Goals**\nWrite down 2-3 specific, measurable goals:\n\n<br/>\nExample poor goal: \"Get better at running\"\nExample good goal: \"Be able to jog for 10 minutes without stopping by November 1st\"\n\n<br/>\nYour goals:\n1. ________________________________ (Target date: ________)\n2. ________________________________ (Target date: ________)\n3. ________________________________ (Target date: ________)\n\n**Step 5: Implementation Plan**\nFill in this plan:\n\n- I will update my tracker: _________________ (when/how often)\n- I will keep my tracker: __________________ (where)\n- If I miss a day, I will: __________________ (backup plan)\n- I will review my progress every: __________ (day/week/month)\n\n## Self-Assessment\nAfter one week of using your tracking system, answer these questions:\n\n- Did I consistently record my activities? (Yes/Mostly/No)\n- What made tracking easy or difficult for me? _________________\n- One thing I learned about my exercise habits: _________________\n- One way I can improve my tracking system: _________________\n\nTracking isn't just about physical improvements - it teaches you to set goals, stick with them, and celebrate when you succeed. These skills will help you in many areas of your life. When exercise feels challenging, your records will remind you of how far you've come and encourage you to keep going. Start tracking today - your future self will thank you!\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Tracking your fitness progress helps you see improvements, stay motivated, and set better goals based on actual performance data.\n- Choose a tracking method that works for you—whether it's a fitness journal, calendar system, milestone tracking, or rating system—and stick with it consistently.\n- Celebrating your achievements and regularly reviewing your progress builds confidence and reinforces the habit of physical activity.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
