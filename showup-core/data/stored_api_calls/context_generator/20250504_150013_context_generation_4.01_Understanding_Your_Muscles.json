Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

In this lesson, we'll explore the main muscle groups, see how they team up to create movement, and learn what makes muscles both strong and long-lasting. You'll discover how your muscles coordinate like players on a sports team and how this knowledge can improve your fitness.\n\n## Your Amazing Muscles\nYour muscles make everything from standing up to scoring goals possible. When you sprint across a field, climb stairs, or lift your backpack, your muscles are doing the work. These powerful tissues connect to your bones and create all the movements you make every day.\n\n## The Major Muscle Groups \nYour body contains more than 600 muscles, but we'll focus on six main groups that handle most movements:\n\n1. **Arms**: Your biceps run along the front of your upper arm while your triceps cover the back. Bend your arm and feel your biceps tighten. Now straighten it and notice your triceps activate instead.\n\n2. **Shoulders**: Your deltoids form a cap over the top of each shoulder. These muscles lift your arms forward, sideways, and backward.\n\n3. **Chest**: Your pectoral muscles span across your chest. They activate when you push a door open or do a push-up.\n\n4. **Back**: Your latissimus dorsi spread across your back like wings. These muscles work when you pull a door closed or do a pull-up.\n\n5. **Core**: Your abdominal muscles in front and lower back muscles behind stabilize your body, help you bend, and protect your spine.\n\n6. **Legs**: Your quadriceps cover the front of your thighs, hamstrings run along the back, and calf muscles power your lower legs. These muscles carry you everywhere you go.\n\n## Muscles Working in Pairs\nYour muscles have an interesting limitation - they can only pull, never push! That's why they work in pairs. One muscle contracts (shortens) while its partner relaxes (lengthens).\n\n**Muscle Pairs Activity:**\n1. Find a comfortable space where you can move your arms freely\n2. Slowly bend your arm at the elbow and place your opposite hand on your bicep\n3. Feel how your bicep tightens and bulges as you bend\n4. Now straighten your arm completely and place your hand on your tricep (back of upper arm)\n5. Notice how your tricep activates while your bicep softens\n\nThis partnership happens throughout your body. Try these additional movements:\n- Sit in a chair and slowly extend your leg straight out. Feel your quadriceps (front of thigh) tighten while your hamstrings (back of thigh) relax\n- Now bend your knee back down and notice the opposite happens - your hamstrings contract while your quadriceps relax\n\n## Muscles in Everyday Activities \nNow let's see how these muscle groups work together in actions you do every day:\n\n**Picking up your backpack:**\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert an \"Audio Instructions\" section within the markers ---audioinstructions--- and ---audioinstructionsEND---.

Pay attention to which muscles you feel working the hardest\n\n**Self-assessment:**\n- Were you able to maintain good form for all 5 repetitions?\n- Which muscles did you feel working the most? (likely chest, shoulders, and arms)\n- Rate your effort level from 1-5, with 5 being maximum effort\n- If you completed Level 1 or 2 easily, consider trying the next level next time\n\n**Troubleshooting tips:**\n- If your wrists hurt, try doing the push-ups on your knuckles or with hands on a raised surface\n- If you feel pain in your shoulders or back, check that your hands are positioned directly under your shoulders\n- If you can't complete all 5 repetitions, take longer rest periods or try an easier variatio\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Your body has six major muscle groups (arms, shoulders, chest, back, core, and legs) that work in pairs—when one muscle contracts, its partner relaxes.\n- Muscles can only pull (not push), which is why they must work together in pairs to create movement in different directions.\n- Muscle strength (ability to exert maximum force) and muscle endurance (ability to sustain effort over time) are different fitness qualities that serve various purposes in sports and daily activities.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the major muscle groups in the human body and how they work together to enable various movements and activities. It covers the concept of muscle pairs, where one muscle contracts while its partner relaxes, as well as the differences between muscle strength and muscle endurance. The content also includes a hands-on activity to explore muscle strength through push-ups.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Incorporate additional \"Audio Instructions\" sections to provide verbal guidance for key concepts and activities.\n2. Add linking paragraphs to improve the flow and readability of the content.\n3. Expand the section on muscle strength vs. muscle endurance to provide more detailed explanations.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical Space/Equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use language and examples appropriate for the target audience, with a focus on clear, concise explanations and step-by-step instructions.
