Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\n# Educational Content Authenticity Enhancement\n\nRefine educational content to eliminate formulaic AI writing patterns while preserving structural integrity and educational substance.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a pattern analysis by identifying:\n1. Predictable comparison structures (\"think of X as Y\", \"imagine X is Y\")\n2. Overused intensifiers and generic language\n3. Formulaic transition phrases\n4. Artificial enthusiasm markers\n5. Repetitive explanation patterns\n\n## REFINEMENT REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - Preserve all educational substance and learning objectives\n   - Maintain the overall document structure and organization\n   \n2. PATTERN ELIMINATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks\n   - Substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions\n   - Convert formulaic transitions to natural connections\n   - Replace artificial excitement markers with inherently interesting content\n   - Eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clich√©s\n   \n3. AUTHENTIC VOICE ENHANCEMENT (SUPPORTING):\n   - Vary sentence structure and length throughout\n   - Replace generic explanations with specific examples\n   - Add natural language variations and conversational elements\n   - Create authentic progression between ideas\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Maintain exact section headings and structural elements\n2. Focus exclusively on language patterns and voice authenticity\n3. Preserve all educational substance while enhancing authenticity\n4. Prioritize natural, varied expression over formulaic patterns\n\nThis refinement creates more authentic, engaging educational content while maintaining perfect structural and educational integrity.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary fitness terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new exercise or activity\n- Use diagrams to show proper body positions and form\n- Add labeled illustrations for exercise variations and modifications\n- Include visual examples of completed activities\n- Provide clear visual representations of safety considerations\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make fitness concepts relatable\n- Create achievable challenges that can be done in various home environments\n\n### Equipment and Space Considerations\n- Provide alternatives using common household items\n- Include adaptations for small spaces (apartment, bedroom, hallway)\n- Design activities with minimal noise impact for shared living spaces\n- Offer variations for different surfaces (carpet, hard floor, outdoors)\n- Suggest creative solutions for tracking progress without specialized equipment\n\n### Safety Guidelines\n- Provide clear safety warnings for each activity\n- Include detailed warm-up and cool-down instructions\n- Offer modified versions for different physical abilities\n- Emphasize proper form over speed or repetitions\n- Include guidance for when to stop an activity if discomfort occurs\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n- Include printable tracking sheets with simple, clear layouts\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"Cardiovascular endurance activities enhance pulmonary efficiency, enabling sustained physical exertion through improved oxygen utilization across multiple muscle groups.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"Cardio exercises make your heart and lungs stronger.
