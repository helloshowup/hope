Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

These robots typically use springs, compressed air, or special motors to store energy and release it quickly, launching themselves into the air.\n\n**Jumping robots** excel at navigating rough terrain with lots of obstacles. While a wheeled robot might get stuck trying to climb over a rock, a jumping robot can simply hop over it! Some jumping robots can leap more than 30 times their own height. The Salto robot developed by UC Berkeley can jump higher than most NBA basketball players!\n\nThese robots are particularly useful for exploring places like disaster zones with rubble, rocky planets like Mars, or even for search and rescue operations where the ground might be uneven or dangerous. Some small jumping robots are being developed that could one day hop through your body to deliver medicine exactly where it's needed.\n\nNew materials are making jumping robots even more impressive. Engineers are now using special elastic materials that can store and release energy like a super-powered rubber band. These materials help robots jump higher while using less battery power. Some jumping robots also use sensors to measure the ground beneath them, adjusting their jumps based on whether they're on soft sand or hard concrete.\n\n### **Snake-like and Inchworm Movement**\n\n**Snake-like robots** use a series of connected segments that bend and twist to create a slithering motion similar to real snakes. These robots excel at squeezing through tight spaces and can navigate through pipes, collapsed buildings, or other confined areas that wheels or legs can't access.\n\nSome snake robots use small wheels or scales along their bodies to help them move forward, while others rely purely on the wave-like motion of their segments. They can climb poles, wrap around objects, and even swim in some cases. Engineers have used snake robots to inspect nuclear power plants, search for survivors in earthquake rubble, and perform minimally invasive surgery.\n\n**Inchworm robots** move by alternately gripping and releasing surfaces while extending and contracting their bodies. This slow but steady approach lets them climb vertical surfaces or move through very narrow spaces. Some inchworm robots can even climb up inside pipes against the flow of water or gas!\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon University snake robot is a real-world example that shows how these designs solve practical problems. This robot has inspected damaged nuclear power plants in Japan after the Fukushima disaster, going into radioactive areas too dangerous for humans. Its camera and sensors send back valuable information while its snake-like body can move through tight spaces between debris. The robot's movement is controlled by special software that coordinates all its segments, making it move smoothly like a real snake.\n\n### **Rolling and Tumbling Designs**\n\nSome of the most creative robot designs move by rolling or tumbling across terrain. **Spherical robots** contain all their components inside a ball-shaped shell that rolls in any direction. These robots are well-protected from dust and water and can move efficiently across flat surfaces.\n\nOther robots can transform their shape to roll when needed. The \"Mixbot\" can switch between walking on legs and tucking into a ball to roll down hills, saving energy. NASA has developed several tumbling robot concepts for exploring other planets, including a \"tumbleweed rover\" that would be blown across Mars by the wind.\n\nSome of the most advanced rolling robots use a principle called **tensegrity**, where rigid parts are connected by flexible cables in a way that lets the whole structure absorb impacts while maintaining its shape. These robots can be dropped from heights or roll down steep slopes without breaking, making them ideal for exploring rough terrain on other planets.\n\nNASA's Super Ball Bot is a fascinating example of tensegrity in action. This robot looks like a jumble of rods and cables, but it can be dropped onto a planet's surface from space without a parachute! The flexible design absorbs the impact, and then the robot can roll across the surface by carefully adjusting the tension in different cables. This design is much lighter than traditional rovers with wheels and can explore more difficult terrain.\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots can move by jumping or hopping to clear obstacles, using springs or elastic materials to store energy and leap over rough terrain that would stop wheeled robots.\n- Snake-like robots use connected segments to slither through tight spaces like pipes or rubble, while inchworm robots grip and release surfaces to climb vertically or through narrow passages.\n- Rolling robots protect their components inside ball-shaped shells or use tensegrity (flexible cables connecting rigid parts) to absorb impacts and move efficiently across different types of terrain.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n</CONTENT>\n",
