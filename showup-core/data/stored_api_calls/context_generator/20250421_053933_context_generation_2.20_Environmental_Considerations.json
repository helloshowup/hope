Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

Sustainable approaches to robot power can help reduce environmental impact.\n\n## **Ecological Impact of Power Sources**\n\nDifferent robot power sources affect the environment in different ways:\n\nManufacturing impacts vary widely between power sources. For example, making lithium-ion batteries requires mining special minerals and uses a lot of energy. Solar panels also need resources to make, though they create clean energy once built.\n\nDisposal challenges happen when robot power systems get too old to use. Batteries can contain harmful materials that need special handling. Lead-acid batteries (like those in cars) can be recycled easily, while some newer battery types are harder to recycle properly.\n\nOperational emissions depend on how the robot gets its power. Robots that plug into wall outlets indirectly create pollution based on how that electricity is made (from coal, natural gas, solar, etc.). Battery-powered robots don't make pollution while they work, but the electricity used to charge them might come from power plants that do.\n\nBy looking at the whole life of robot power systems - from making to throwing away - engineers can make choices that are better for the environment.\n\n## **Sustainable Energy for Robots**\n\nMany cool approaches are making robot power systems more environmentally friendly:\n\nRenewable energy integration lets robots use clean power sources. Solar-powered robots are becoming more common, especially for outdoor jobs like checking farm crops or testing water quality. Some places are even building robot charging stations powered by wind or solar energy.\n\nClean energy benefits go beyond just reducing pollution. Robots powered by renewable energy can work in sensitive places like nature parks without bothering animals with noise or exhaust. They can also work in faraway areas where bringing in fuel would be difficult and possibly harm the environment.\n\nCircular design approaches focus on making robot power systems that can be easily fixed, upgraded, or recycled. Some companies are designing robots with battery packs that can be replaced one by one when they wear out, instead of throwing away the whole power system.\n\nThese sustainable approaches help reduce the environmental impact of robotics while often providing practical benefits like working longer in remote areas.\n\n## **Future Trends in Robot Power**\n\nThe future of robot power looks exciting, with several new technologies that could change how we power robots:\n\nBiological power sources copy how living things make energy. Some test robots can turn sugar into electricity, similar to how our bodies use food for energy. Others use microbial fuel cells, where tiny organisms create electricity as they break down organic matter.\n\nAmbient energy harvesting allows robots to collect small amounts of energy from their surroundings - from vibrations, temperature differences, radio signals, or even small air movements. While these methods don't make much power by themselves, combining several approaches could someday let robots work indefinitely without needing to plug in or recharge.\n\nHybrid power systems combine multiple power sources to get the best of each. For example, a robot might use solar panels for everyday work but have a fuel cell backup for cloudy days or tasks that need more power. These flexible approaches could make robots more versatile and reliable in challenging environments.\n\nAs these technologies develop, we might see robots that can power themselves indefinitely in the environment, creating new possibilities for long-term environmental monitoring, space exploration, and other jobs where humans can't easily help.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** What would be the implications of developing robots that can harvest their own energy from the environment? Consider how this capability might transform robot applications, deployment scenarios, and our relationship with autonomous machines.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n### **Check your understanding**\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nA robot designed to operate continuously in a remote forest location for environmental monitoring would most likely use which power source?\n\nA. Standard alkaline batteries that need frequent replacement\n\nB. A direct power cord connected to an electrical outlet\n\nC. Solar panels with rechargeable battery storage\n\nD. A small nuclear power cell\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is C. Solar panels with rechargeable battery storage. For continuous operation in a remote forest location, the robot needs a renewable power source with storage capability. Solar panels can harvest energy during daylight hours, while the rechargeable batteries provide power during nighttime or low-light conditions. This combination offers sustainability and self-sufficiency without requiring human intervention for battery replacement or access to power outlets, making it the most practical solution for this application.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robot power sources affect the environment in different ways when they're made, used, and thrown away.\n- Using renewable energy (like solar power) and designing robots with parts that can be reused helps make robots better for the planet.\n- New technologies like energy harvesting and biological power sources could help future robots work for a long time without harming the environment.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n</CONTENT>\n",
