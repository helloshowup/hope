  "prompt": "\n# Analysis Task: Generate Preparatory Context for Enhancement\n# Content Type: Educational Material\n# Processing Mode: Batch Enhancement\n\nPlease analyze the current content, enhancement prompt, and target learner profile to create a comprehensive \ncontext that will guide content enhancement while:\n1. Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Unified Target Learner Profile  \n**Excel Education Systems (Grades 6–12)**\n\n## GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\n- **Age Range:** 11–18 years old, covering middle and high school grades (6–12).\n- **Enrollment Type:** Students are enrolled full- or part-time in an accredited, asynchronous online learning environment.\n- **Learning Format:** All courses are asynchronous and self-paced, requiring students to work independently and manage their own schedules.\n- **Geographic Reach:** Students are globally distributed, participating from diverse countries and time zones.\n- **Language:** Instruction is in English. Students are required to read, write, and communicate at a minimum of a 6th-grade level to succeed.\n- **Technology Access:** Students have varying levels of digital literacy and access to devices. Most use laptops or desktop computers with basic office software and reliable internet.\n\n## ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL BACKGROUNDS\n\n- **Academic Diversity:** Learners come from a wide range of educational experiences. Some are advanced and college-bound; others are catching up on credits or exploring alternative education pathways.\n- **Skill Levels:** Varying levels of prior knowledge, especially in middle school where formal instruction in certain subjects may be limited.\n- **Career and College Orientation:** High school students are often preparing for post-secondary education or career pathways. Some are enrolled in dual credit or honors tracks.\n- **Special Circumstances:** Many students enroll due to the need for flexibility—balancing academics with travel, work, family obligations, or social/emotional considerations.\n\n## LEARNING ENVIRONMENT & SUPPORT NEEDS\n\n- **Self-Management:** Success depends heavily on student motivation, time management, and initiative. Students need tools and strategies to stay on track without daily external supervision.\n- **Parental Involvement:** Particularly important for younger learners (grades 6–8), where parents often help set routines, provide motivation, and monitor progress.\n- **Physical Learning Space:** Students complete coursework from home or other informal settings.
