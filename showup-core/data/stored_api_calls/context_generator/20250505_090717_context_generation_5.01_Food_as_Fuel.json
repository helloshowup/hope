Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\nThink of your body like a car that needs the right fuel to run properly. Just as cars need gasoline, your body needs nutrients to move, play, and grow. When you're active - whether you're playing basketball at recess or riding your bike after school - your body uses three main types of nutrients to keep you going. Let's explore each one and discover how they help power all the amazing things your body can do!\n\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\nImagine you're about to race your friend across the playground. Your body needs energy right away! That's where carbohydrates come in. Carbs are like the kindling that starts a campfire - they light up quickly and give you immediate power. When you eat foods like pasta before a soccer game or an apple at lunch, you're giving your body the quick fuel it needs to run, jump, and play.\n\n- Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n- You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n- Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n- Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n- Activity: Stand up and do 10 jumping jacks. Take a moment to notice how your breathing changes. Your body just used carbohydrates to power that movement.\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\nHave you ever noticed how your legs feel a bit sore the day after a long bike ride or hike? That's your muscles saying, \"Hey, we worked hard and now we need to rebuild!\" Proteins are the construction workers of your body. After you exercise, these tiny workers rush in to repair and strengthen your muscles. Foods like chicken in your sandwich or beans in your burrito are sending in these helpful workers to make your body stronger.\n\n- Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n- Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n- Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n- This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n- Activity: Gently squeeze your arm muscle. The firmness you feel is made of protein that helps your body move.\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\nIf carbs are like kindling for a fire, then healthy fats are like the big logs that keep the fire burning for hours. When you're playing in an all-day soccer tournament or going on a long hike, your body needs energy that lasts. Healthy fats provide this slow-burning fuel that helps you keep going when your quick energy is used up.\n\n- Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n- Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n- Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n- Your brain needs fats to work well\n- We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein, but they're still important for health\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a two paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n---audioinstructions---\n### Audio Instructions: How to Sort Foods by Nutrients\n\nhttps://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/5-1-1.mp3\n---audioinstructionsEND---\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items\n2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings\n4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in\n3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle\n4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)\n5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:\n\n- Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)\n- An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database\n- A food guide chart (included below)\n\n### Example of Completed Activity:\n\n- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana\n- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt\n- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\nDon't worry if you get stuck during this activity – even nutrition scientists sometimes debate about how to classify certain foods! Many of the foods we eat daily are combinations of different nutrients. For example, whole milk contains both protein and fat, while beans have both protein and carbs. If you're unsure, try looking at the food label or asking an adult at home. Remember, the goal isn't to get everything perfectly right, but to start thinking about what's in your food and how it helps your body.\n\n- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.\n- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.\n- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\nJust like you wouldn't fill your water bottle after finishing a long bike ride (when you're already thirsty!), timing your food is super important for feeling your best during physical activities. Your body needs different types of fuel depending on whether you're about to start playing, in the middle of a game, or recovering afterward. The food choices you make can be your secret weapon for having more energy, playing better, and feeling stronger after exercise.\n\nTiming matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  - 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  - 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  - After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n\nA \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  - 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  - 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  - 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  - Small amount: Healthy fats\n\nBalanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  - Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  - Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  - Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  - Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your body needs three main nutrients for physical activity: carbohydrates for quick energy, proteins for muscle building and repair, and fats for long-lasting energy.\n- Timing your meals matters for performance - eat larger balanced meals 2-3 hours before activity, quick carbs 30-60 minutes before, and protein with carbs after exercise for recovery.\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" for active bodies includes half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains, one-quarter protein foods, and a small amount of healthy fats.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
