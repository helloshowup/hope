Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\n# Educational Content Quality Assurance & Practical Implementation Review\n\nReview and refine educational content that has been transformed from classroom-based to online learning, ensuring practical effectiveness beyond technical compliance.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a critical assessment by identifying:\n1. Superficial transformations that merely shifted perspective without meaningful adaptation\n2. Self-directed instructions that remain impractical for independent learning\n3. Activities that still implicitly require a classroom, teacher, or group setting\n4. Assessment components that lack clear self-evaluation mechanisms\n5. Instances where the spirit of adaptation was not fulfilled despite technical compliance\n\n## CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. PRACTICAL ADAPTATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Convert superficial self-prompts to genuinely independent activities\n   - Replace \"ask yourself\" or \"give yourself prompts\" with concrete, actionable tasks\n   - Transform timed assessments to milestone-based progress measurements\n   - Provide specific success criteria for self-assessment\n   \n2. IMPLEMENTATION CLARITY (IMPORTANT):\n   - Add specific setup instructions for home-based learning environment\n   - Provide concrete alternatives for any specialized equipment\n   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common implementation challenges\n   - Clarify exactly how to perform and evaluate each activity independently\n   \n3. LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS (SUPPORTING):\n   - Ensure each activity reinforces specific learning objectives\n   - Add self-reflection components that guide deeper understanding\n   - Include examples of completed activities where helpful\n   - Provide multiple difficulty options for diverse learning needs\n\n## REVISION GUIDELINES:\n1. Maintain structural integrity while making practical adaptations\n2. Focus specifically on transforming content that merely \"shifted voice\" to the learner\n3. Replace any remaining classroom-dependent elements with truly independent alternatives\n4. Convert assessments from testing frameworks to learning reinforcement\n5. Preserve educational substance while ensuring practical effectiveness\n\nThis quality assurance review ensures the transformed content is genuinely effective for independent, asynchronous learning - not just technically compliant with transformation requirements.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary fitness terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new exercise or activity\n- Use diagrams to show proper body positions and form\n- Add labeled illustrations for exercise variations and modifications\n- Include visual examples of completed activities\n- Provide clear visual representations of safety considerations\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make fitness concepts relatable\n- Create achievable challenges that can be done in various home environments\n\n### Equipment and Space Considerations\n- Provide alternatives using common household items\n- Include adaptations for small spaces (apartment, bedroom, hallway)\n- Design activities with minimal noise impact for shared living spaces\n- Offer variations for different surfaces (carpet, hard floor, outdoors)\n- Suggest creative solutions for tracking progress without specialized equipment\n\n### Safety Guidelines\n- Provide clear safety warnings for each activity\n- Include detailed warm-up and cool-down instructions\n- Offer modified versions for different physical abilities\n- Emphasize proper form over speed or repetitions\n- Include guidance for when to stop an activity if discomfort occurs\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n- Include printable tracking sheets with simple, clear layouts\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"Cardiovascular endurance activities enhance pulmonary efficiency, enabling sustained physical exertion through improved oxygen utilization across multiple muscle groups.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"Cardio exercises make your heart and lungs stronger.

Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n   - You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n   - Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n   - Notice it yourself: After doing 10 jumping jacks, your body just used carbs to power that movement\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n   - Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n   - Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n   - Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n   - This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n   - When you exercise regularly and eat enough protein, your muscles gradually become stronger\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n   - Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n   - Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n   - Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n   - Your brain needs fats to work well\n   - We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n- Find 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or pictures of foods)\n- Group these items into \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n- For foods with multiple ingredients like pizza, decide which nutrient is most abundant\n- Use food labels or look online to check your answers\n- Many foods contain more than one nutrient - that's normal!\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  * 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  * 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  * After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  * 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  * 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  * 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  * Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  * Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  * Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  * Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  * Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Over to You \n- Test your knowledge: List 5 nutrient functions you learned today and check if they're correct\n- Create a \"My Performance Plate\" drawing showing what you would eat:\n  * Before your favourite physical activity\n  * After your favourite physical activity\n- Challenge yourself: Try one new performance-boosting food this week and write down how it made you feel\n- Good food choices help your body perform better in everything you do!\n</CONTENT>\n",
