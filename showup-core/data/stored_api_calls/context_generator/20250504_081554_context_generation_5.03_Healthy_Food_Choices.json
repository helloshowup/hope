When you're running around in PE, playing sports or just having fun with friends, the food you eat before and after makes a real difference to your performance and how you feel. Good nutrition can give you more energy, help build stronger muscles, and keep you going during all your activities.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model shows how to build a balanced meal using a simple plate diagram. Your plate should include:\n- **Fruits**: These colourful foods provide quick energy and vitamins (apples, bananas, berries)\n- **Vegetables**: Packed with vitamins and minerals to support your health (carrots, broccoli, spinach)\n- **Grains**: These provide lasting energy for your activities (bread, pasta, rice - whole grain versions are best)\n- **Protein**: These foods help build and repair your muscles (chicken, beans, eggs, nuts)\n- **Dairy**: Great for building strong bones (milk, yogurt, cheese)\n\nIncluding foods from each group in your meals will help keep your body properly fuelled.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nA small snack about 30-60 minutes before exercise gives your body the energy it needs to perform well. Some good pre-workout snack ideas include:\n\n- **Banana with a spoonful of peanut butter**: The banana provides quick energy while the peanut butter helps that energy last longer\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: A tasty mix of quick energy and protein\n- **Yogurt with berries**: Easy to digest and full of nutrients\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These provide steady energy that won't disappear too quickly\n\nRemember: Keep your pre-workout snack light - just enough to fuel your activity without making you feel sluggish.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nAfter being active, your body needs to recover and repair. Eating within 30-45 minutes after exercise helps your muscles rebuild and grow stronger. Good post-workout foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: It's not just a treat - chocolate milk has a good balance of carbs and protein to help your body recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The protein helps repair muscles, while the wrap provides needed carbohydrates\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Quick to make and packed with nutrients\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: A flavourful combination that provides protein and carbs\n\nDon't forget to drink water after exercise! Replacing the fluids lost through sweat is a key part of recovery.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels tell you what's actually in the food you're eating. Here's what to look for:\n\n- **Serving size**: How much food counts as one serving\n- **Calories**: The amount of energy the food provides\n- **Protein**: Foods with good protein content help your muscles\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - whole grains and natural sugars are better choices than added sugars\n- **Sugars**: Try to limit foods with lots of added sugars\n- **Ingredients list**: Shorter lists with recognisable ingredients usually mean less processed foods\n\n## Over to You\nNext time you're at the shop or in your kitchen, compare the labels on two similar snacks. Which one would be better before or after exercise? Why? Try keeping a food diary for a day and see how your meals match up with the MyPlate model.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhat you eat before and after physical activity significantly impacts your performance and recovery. Using the MyPlate model, choosing appropriate pre- and post-workout snacks, and understanding food labels will help you make smart choices. With the right nutrition, you'll have more energy, build stronger muscles, and feel your best during all your activities!\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
