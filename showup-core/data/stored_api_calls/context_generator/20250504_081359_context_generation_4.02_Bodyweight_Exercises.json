Instead of using weights or machines, bodyweight training uses the weight of your own body to make your muscles work. When you do a push-up, you're lifting part of your body weight with your arms. When you do a squat, you're using your leg muscles to lower and lift your body.\n\nThe best part? You don't need any special kit, and you can do these exercises almost anywhere! Whether you're at home watching telly, at the park with mates, or even in your bedroom before bed, you can squeeze in a quick workout to make your muscles stronger.\n\n## Awesome Bodyweight Exercises You Can Try\n\n### For Your Arms\n- **Wall Push-ups**: Stand facing a wall with your hands on the wall at shoulder height. Bend your elbows to bring your chest toward the wall, then push back. It's a gentler version of a regular push-up—perfect for beginners!\n- **Chair Dips**: Sit on the edge of a sturdy chair. Place your hands on the edge of the seat next to your hips. Slide your bottom off the chair and lower yourself by bending your elbows. Push back up to the starting position.\n\n### For Your Shoulders\n- **Arm Circles**: Stand with your arms out to the sides like aeroplane wings. Make small circles with your arms, first forward for 10 seconds, then backward for 10 seconds. Feel the burn!\n- **Shoulder Taps**: Get into a push-up position (you can do this on your knees if it's too hard). Keeping your body still, lift one hand and tap the opposite shoulder, then switch sides.\n\n### For Your Chest\n- **Push-ups**: Start in a plank position with hands under shoulders. Lower your chest toward the floor by bending your elbows, then push back up.\n- **Too hard? Try knee push-ups**: Same as above, but with your knees on the floor for less resistance.\n\n### For Your Back\n- **Superman**: Lie on your stomach with arms stretched out in front of you. Lift your arms, chest, and legs off the floor and hold for 2-3 seconds. Just like the superhero flying!\n- **Backward Snow Angels**: Lie on your stomach with arms by your sides. Lift your chest slightly and move your arms like you're making a snow angel.\n\n### For Your Core (Abs and Lower Back)\n- **Plank**: Hold a push-up position (on hands or forearms) with your body in a straight line from head to heels. Can you hold it for 20 seconds?\n- **Curl-ups**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat. Place your hands on your thighs. Curl up until your hands reach your knees, then lower back down.\n- **Bird-dog**: Start on your hands and knees. Reach your right arm forward while extending your left leg backward. Hold for 2 seconds, return to start, then switch sides.\n\n### For Your Legs\n- **Squats**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and push your hips back like you're sitting in an invisible chair. Stand back up and repeat.\n- **Lunges**: Take a big step forward with one foot and lower your body until both knees are bent at 90-degree angles. Push back up and repeat with the other leg.\n- **Calf Raises**: Stand with feet hip-width apart. Rise up onto your toes as high as you can, then lower back down.\n\n## Doing It Right (and Making It Work for You)\nWhen doing these exercises, remember:\n- Keep your back straight during planks and push-ups (no sagging or arching!)\n- Don't let your knees go past your toes during squats and lunges\n- Move slowly and with control—no bouncing or jerking!\n\nIf an exercise is too hard:\n- Do fewer repetitions (reps means how many times you do an exercise)\n- Take breaks when you need them\n- Try the easier versions (like knee push-ups instead of regular push-ups)\n\nIf an exercise is too easy:\n- Do more repetitions\n- Hold positions longer\n- Try the harder versions (like regular push-ups instead of wall push-ups)\n\n## Fun Ways to Practise\nTry these fun activities to practise your new bodyweight exercises:\n\n1. **Bodyweight Bingo**: Create bingo cards with different exercises in each square. When an exercise is called, everyone performs it before marking their card!\n\n2. **Exercise Dice**: Roll a die to determine which exercise to do and how many times to do it.\n\n3. **Fitness Challenges with Friends**: See who can hold a plank the longest or do the most squats in 30 seconds.\n\n4. **Create Your Own Routine**: Design a 5-minute workout using your favourite exercises from this lesson. Share it with a friend!\n\n## Over to You\nTake a moment to think about these questions:\n- Which exercises did you find easiest? Which were most challenging?\n- How did your body feel during and after the exercises?\n- Where might you fit these exercises into your daily routine?\n- Could you create a quick 3-minute workout using your three favourite exercises?\n\n## Wrapping Up\nBodyweight exercises are a brilliant way to build strength and flexibility without needing any special equipment. By practising these exercises regularly, you'll notice improvements in your strength, endurance, and how your body feels overall. Remember, everyone starts somewhere—it's okay if you can only do a few repetitions at first. Keep at it, and you'll get stronger every day!\n\nNext time you're watching telly or have a few minutes to spare, try doing some squats, push-ups, or planks. Your muscles will thank you!\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
