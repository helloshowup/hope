(5 minutes)\nHave you ever noticed your breathing changes when you're nervous or upset? Maybe your heart races before a big game or test. Your breathing gets faster when you're stressed and slower when you're relaxed.\n\n### Over to You\nWhen was the last time you felt really nervous or stressed? What happened to your breathing?\n\nThe cool thing is that you can actually control your breathing to help calm your body and mind. Professional athletes, musicians, and even video gamers use these techniques to perform their best!\n\n### Belly Breathing - Your Superpower for Calm (5 minutes)\n\n**Try This:**\n1. Lie on your back with your knees bent\n2. Place both hands on your belly\n3. Breathe in slowly through your nose and feel your belly push up against your hands\n4. Breathe out slowly through your mouth and feel your belly sink down\n5. Repeat 5 times, keeping your chest still\n\nBelly breathing helps turn on your body's \"rest and relax\" system. It's like having a remote control for your stress level!\n\n**When to Use It:** Before bed, when you feel worried, or anytime you need to calm down.\n\n### Box Breathing - Your Focus Booster (5 minutes)\n\n**Try This:**\n1. Sit up tall with your back straight\n2. Breathe in through your nose while counting to 4\n3. Hold your breath for a count of 4\n4. Breathe out through your mouth for a count of 4\n5. Hold for a count of 4 with empty lungs\n6. Repeat 3 times\n\nImagine drawing a square in your mind as you breathe - up, across, down, and across.\n\n**When to Use It:** Before tests, when you need to concentrate, or when you feel scattered.\n\n### Cooling Breath - Your Quick Reset Button (5 minutes)\n\n**Try This:**\n1. Sit comfortably and take a normal breath\n2. Breathe in through your nose and notice the cool air\n3. Slightly part your lips and breathe out slowly, like you're fogging up a window\n4. Make your exhale longer than your inhale (breathe out longer than you breathe in)\n5. Repeat 5 times\n\nThe cooling breath works like a reset button when you feel too hot, angry, or frustrated.\n\n**When to Use It:** When you feel angry, overheated, or need to cool down quickly.\n\n### Body Scan - Your Body Detective Tool (7 minutes)\n\n**Try This:**\n1. Lie down in a comfortable position\n2. Close your eyes or look at one spot\n3. Start at your toes and \"scan\" up your body\n4. Notice any tight spots or comfortable areas\n5. Take a deep breath when you find tension\n6. Imagine the tension melting away as you breathe out\n7. Continue all the way up to the top of your head\n\n**Safety Tip:** If something hurts or feels uncomfortable, don't force it. Just notice it and move on.\n\nThe body scan helps you become aware of how your body feels. When you know where you hold stress, you can release it!\n\n**When to Use It:** Before bed, when you feel tense, or when you need to check in with yourself.\n\n### Muscle Relaxation - Your Tension Releaser (7 minutes)\n\n**Try This:**\n1. Start with your feet\n2. Squeeze your toes and feet really tight for 5 seconds\n3. Release completely and notice how they feel\n4. Move up to your legs - tighten for 5 seconds, then release\n5. Continue with your stomach, hands, arms, shoulders, and face\n6. End by relaxing your whole body at once\n\n**Modification:** If you have limited space, you can do this sitting in a chair.\n\nThis exercise helps you feel the difference between tension and relaxation. Many people walk around with tight muscles all day without realising it!\n\n**When to Use It:** After sitting for a long time, before bed, or when your body feels stiff.\n\n### Breathing with Movement - Putting It All Together (7 minutes)\n\n**Try This:**\n1. Stand with feet hip-width apart (about as wide as your hips)\n2. Breathe in as you slowly raise your arms up\n3. Breathe out as you lower your arms\n4. Breathe in as you gently twist to one side\n5. Breathe out as you return to centre\n6. Repeat on the other side\n7. Continue for 1-2 minutes, moving with your breath\n\n**Modification:** If you have limited space, you can do smaller movements or try this seated.\n\nConnecting your breath with movement helps your mind and body work together. This is what makes activities like yoga, tai chi, and martial arts so effective!\n\n**When to Use It:** In the morning to wake up, during study breaks, or whenever you need to refresh.\n\n### Wrapping Up (5 minutes)\n\nYou've learnt six handy techniques to help you stay calm, focused, and in control. These skills can help you:\n- Fall asleep faster\n- Do better on tests\n- Handle tough emotions\n- Improve in sports\n- Feel more relaxed\n\n**Your Challenge:** Try at least one of these techniques every day this week. Notice which ones you like best and when they help the most.\n\n**Remember:** Just like learning to ride a bike or play a video game, these skills get better with practise!\n\n### Over to You\n- Which breathing technique would help you most before a big test?\n- How does the body scan help you become more aware?\n- What's one situation where you might use the cooling breath?\n- How could you use muscle relaxation before bedtime?\n\n**Track Your Progress:** In your PE journal, write down which techniques you tried and how they made you feel.\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
