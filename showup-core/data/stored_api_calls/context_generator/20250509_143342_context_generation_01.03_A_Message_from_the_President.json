Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\n# Learning Objectives Generator for Middle School Content\n\nI need learning objectives inserted into the markdown content. Follow these precise requirements:\n\n## TASK OVERVIEW\nGenerate 1-3 learning objectives for 11-14 year old students (6th grade reading level) and insert them after the main title using the proper edit commands.\n\n## TARGET AUDIENCE REQUIREMENTS\nThe content is for middle school students (grades 6-8):\n- VOCABULARY SIMPLICITY IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY\n- Keep all words under 8 letters when possible\n- Use concrete rather than abstract language\n- Avoid multi-syllable academic terms\n- Explain concepts using familiar examples\n- Assume this might be the student's first exposure to the topic\n\n## INSERTION INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Identify the insertion point:\n   - After the main title/heading (typically H1 or H2)\n   - Before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section\n\n2. Format the objectives exactly like this:\n```\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- [First objective with simple verb]\n- [Second objective with simple verb]\n- [Third objective with simple verb]\n\n```\n\n3. Maintain proper spacing:\n   - One empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - One empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Do not disrupt existing paragraph breaks\n\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS\n1. Maximum of 3 objectives per lesson\n2. Must be SMART:\n   - Specific: Clear, focused on one skill\n   - Measurable: Observable performance\n   - Achievable: Realistic for a 1-2 hour lesson\n   - Relevant: Directly tied to lesson content\n   - Time-bound: Accomplishable in one session\n\n3. Use these age-appropriate action verbs:\n   - **Simple Knowledge**: List, Name, Point to, Tell, Show\n   - **Basic Understanding**: Explain, Retell, Show how, Give examples\n   - **Application**: Use, Build, Make, Try, Show\n   - **Simple Analysis**: Sort, Group, Compare, Find reasons why\n   - **Creation**: Create, Make, Build, Put together\n   - **Choice-Making**: Pick the best, Rate, Choose, Decide\n\n## VOCABULARY SIMPLIFICATION RULES\n1. Replace any words over 8 letters with simpler alternatives\n2. Replace abstract concepts with concrete examples\n3. Eliminate academic jargon like \"differentiate,\" \"analyze,\" or \"evaluate\"\n4. Test each objective by asking: \"Would a 12-year-old understand every word?\"\n5. STRICTLY AVOID:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Academic terms (analyze, evaluate, differentiate, synthesize)\n   - Multiple skills in one objective\n   - Complex sentence structures with multiple clauses\n\n## RESPONSE FORMAT\nUse ONLY this edit command format:\n```\nINSERT AFTER LINE X:\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- [First simple objective]\n- [Second simple objective]\n- [Third simple objective]\n\n```\nWhere X is the line number after the title and before first content.\n\n## EXAMPLES OF PROPERLY SIMPLIFIED OBJECTIVES\n\n**Science Example**\nToo Academic: \"Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable energy sources.\"\nBetter: \"Sort energy types into two groups: ones that last forever and ones that run out.\"\n\n**Math Example**\nToo Academic: \"Apply proportional reasoning to solve problems.\"\nBetter: \"Use ratios to solve everyday math problems.\"\n\n**Language Arts Example**\nToo Academic: \"Analyze how word choice affects tone.\"\nBetter: \"Find words that make you feel happy, sad, or scared in a story.\"\n\n**History Example**\nToo Academic: \"Evaluate the impact of technological advancements.\"\nBetter: \"Show how new tools changed how people lived long ago.\"\n\n**Art Example**\nToo Academic: \"Demonstrate application of complementary colors.\"\nBetter: \"Show how to use colors that look good together.\"\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Unified Target Learner Profile  \n**Excel Education Systems (Grades 6–12)**\n\n## GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\n- **Age Range:** 11–18 years old, covering middle and high school grades (6–12).\n- **Enrollment Type:** Students are enrolled full- or part-time in an accredited, asynchronous online learning environment.\n- **Learning Format:** All courses are asynchronous and self-paced, requiring students to work independently and manage their own schedules.\n- **Geographic Reach:** Students are globally distributed, participating from diverse countries and time zones.\n- **Language:** Instruction is in English. Students are required to read, write, and communicate at a minimum of a 6th-grade level to succeed.\n- **Technology Access:** Students have varying levels of digital literacy and access to devices. Most use laptops or desktop computers with basic office software and reliable internet.\n\n## ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL BACKGROUNDS\n\n- **Academic Diversity:** Learners come from a wide range of educational experiences. Some are advanced and college-bound; others are catching up on credits or exploring alternative education pathways.\n- **Skill Levels:** Varying levels of prior knowledge, especially in middle school where formal instruction in certain subjects may be limited.\n- **Career and College Orientation:** High school students are often preparing for post-secondary education or career pathways. Some are enrolled in dual credit or honors tracks.\n- **Special Circumstances:** Many students enroll due to the need for flexibility—balancing academics with travel, work, family obligations, or social/emotional considerations.\n\n## LEARNING ENVIRONMENT & SUPPORT NEEDS\n\n- **Self-Management:** Success depends heavily on student motivation, time management, and initiative. Students need tools and strategies to stay on track without daily external supervision.\n- **Parental Involvement:** Particularly important for younger learners (grades 6–8), where parents often help set routines, provide motivation, and monitor progress.\n- **Physical Learning Space:** Students complete coursework from home or other informal settings. Space and equipment availability vary; content must accommodate these limitations.\n- **Support Systems:** Students benefit from access to academic coaching, tech support, and structured communication channels (Help Desk, progress tracking tools).\n\n## INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Readability:** Use plain language with short sentences. Aim for a 5th–6th grade reading level for younger students, with progressive complexity for high school learners.\n- **Clarity and Engagement:** Content must be engaging and broken into manageable chunks. Use explicit task directions, active verbs, and one clear objective per activity.\n- **Visual and Interactive Elements:** Favor diagrams, examples, videos, and interactive tools. Visual demonstrations and storytelling are particularly effective for middle schoolers.\n- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Content must reflect global awareness and avoid region-specific assumptions. Examples and references should be inclusive and widely understandable.\n- **Flexibility:** Design activities that can be completed with minimal materials and adaptable for small or shared spaces.\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 1.3 A Message from the President\n\nYour journey at Excel High School starts here.

As an online student, it's important to know who these people are and how they can support you.\n\n<br/>\nThe Excel High School administrative team includes:\n\n- Dr. Mark A.

Remember that in an online learning environment where you work at your own pace, reaching out when you need help is a key part of your success.\n\n### Your Success at Excel High School\n\nYour educational journey at Excel High School will be uniquely yours. Unlike traditional classroom settings where everyone moves at the same pace, our online format allows you to take ownership of your learning in ways that might be new to you. Some days you might power through multiple lessons, while other days you might need to slow down and really focus on mastering a challenging concept. This flexibility is one of the greatest advantages of our program, but it also requires a different approach to learning.\n\n<br/>\nMany of our most successful students tell us that establishing a consistent routine was their secret weapon. Whether it's setting up a dedicated study space at home, blocking out specific hours each day for schoolwork, or creating weekly goals to track progress, finding what works for your personal learning style is essential. Remember that your Excel team is here to help you develop these strategies – you're never alone on this journey, even when working independently online.\n\n<br/>\nWhat does success look like at Excel High School? Here are some key elements:\n\n<br/>\n1. **Self-motivation and time management** - As an online student, you'll need to develop strong organisational skills and the ability to work independently. This might mean creating a weekly schedule or using digital tools to track assignments.\n\n<br/>\n2. **Active engagement with the curriculum** - The more you interact with the course materials, the more you'll learn and grow. This includes completing all readings, participating in discussions, and applying concepts to real-world situations.\n\n<br/>\n3. **Utilising available resources** - Don't hesitate to reach out to your Success Coach, use the Help Desk, or access other support services when needed. These resources exist specifically to help you succeed!\n\n<br/>\n4. **Embracing the school's core values** - Understanding Excel's commitment to academic excellence, innovation, and student well-being can help you stay motivated and focused on your goals throughout your educational journey.\n\n### Over to You: Reflecting on the Vision\nNow that you've learned about Excel High School's vision and leadership, take a moment to reflect on the following question:\n\n**Which of the three presidential promises (academic excellence, innovation, or student well-being) feels most important to your success, and why?**\n\nYour answer to this question can help you identify what matters most to you in your educational journey and how Excel High School can best support your needs and goals.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Excel High School's vision is built on three key promises: academic excellence through rigorous standards and recognized accreditation, innovation through up-to-date curriculum and technology, and student well-being through personalized support.\n- Success in an online learning environment requires developing self-motivation, time management skills, active engagement with course materials, and utilizing available resources when needed.\n- The Excel High School leadership team, including Dr. Ulven and various support staff, is committed to providing personalized guidance to help students achieve their academic goals in a flexible online environment.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an introductory section of an orientation for new students at Excel High School, an accredited online learning program. It provides an overview of the school's vision, leadership, and key success factors for students in the asynchronous, self-paced online format.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key task is to insert 1-3 clear, age-appropriate learning objectives for middle school students (grades 6-8) after the main title. These objectives must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). The language used should be simple, concrete, and accessible to 11-14 year old students reading at a 6th grade level.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target audience is middle school students aged 11-14 (grades 6-8).\n- Vocabulary simplicity is the highest priority - use words under 8 letters when possible, avoid academic jargon, and explain concepts with familiar examples.\n- Assume this may be the student's first exposure to the topic, so content should be introductory and build a basic foundation.\n- Learning objectives and content should be engaging and interactive, favoring visual elements, stories, and hands-on activities over dense text.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for an asynchronous, self-paced online learning environment. Students will access the material independently, so it must be highly structured, with clear instructions and support resources available.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core messaging and intent of the original content, which is to introduce Excel High School's vision, leadership, and keys to student success.\n- Enhance the content by adding targeted learning objectives that align with the 6th grade reading level and middle school student needs.\n- Ensure the learning objectives are SMART and use age-appropriate action verbs that focus on simple knowledge, understanding, and application.\n- Maintain the overall flow and formatting of the original content, making only the necessary changes to insert the learning objectives.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Identify the appropriate insertion point for the learning objectives, which should be after the main title and before the first content section.\n2. Craft 1-3 SMART learning objectives that align with the content and target audience. Use simple, concrete language and age-appropriate action verbs.\n3. Format the learning objectives section exactly as specified in the enhancement prompt, including the required spacing and formatting.\n4. Review the content to ensure the learning objectives are well-integrated and the overall flow and readability are maintained.\n5. Consider adding additional visual elements, examples, or interactive components to further engage the middle school audience, if appropriate."
