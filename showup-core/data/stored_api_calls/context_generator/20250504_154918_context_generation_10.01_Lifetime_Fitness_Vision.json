Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n### What Happens When You Stay Active\nRegular physical activity provides these benefits:\n\n- Strengthens your heart and lungs\n- Develops muscle and bone density\n- Boosts your energy levels\n- Lifts your mood and sharpens concentration\n- Improves sleep quality\n- Maintains healthy weight\n\n\n### What Happens When You Don't Stay Active\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nLack of movement leads to:\n\n- Muscle atrophy and weakness\n- Increased bone fragility\n- Decreased energy\n- Difficulty maintaining healthy weight\n- Poor sleep\n- Higher risk of health problems\n\n**Activity: Movement Comparison Chart**\n1. Create a two-column chart labeled \"Active Days\" and \"Inactive Days\"\n2. For 3 days, track how your body feels after being active vs. inactive\n3. Record at least 3 specific observations in each column (Example: \"After sitting all day: My legs felt stiff\" or \"After playing basketball: I felt more awake\")\n4. Circle the differences that matter most to you\n\n## Setting Goals That Grow With You\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nAs you get older, your fitness goals will change. Here are three types to consider:\n\n### 1. Performance Goals\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nThese measure what your body can accomplish.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Complete a mile run without breaks\n- Perform 10 proper push-ups\n- Reach your toes in a seated position\n- Jump rope continuously for 2 minutes\n\n![Diagram: Simple illustrations showing proper form for push-ups with labelled body positions]\n\n**How to measure:** Use a timer, counter, or measuring tape to track your progress. Record your starting point and check improvements every two weeks.\n\n### 2. Process Goals\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nThese track your activity frequency.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Move for 60 minutes daily\n- Sample one new physical activity monthly\n- Walk your dog three times weekly\n- Stretch for 10 minutes before sleeping\n\n**How to track:** Use a calendar, checklist, or simple chart to mark each time you complete the activity. Success means hitting your target frequency for at least 3 weeks.\n\n### 3. Health Goals\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nThese reflect how you want to feel.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Increase daytime energy\n- Enhance sleep quality\n- Reduce stress levels\n- Correct your posture\n\n**How to evaluate:** Rate each feeling on a 1-5 scale before starting your fitness plan. Re-rate every two weeks to track improvements. Success means seeing at least a 1-point improvement.\n\n**Goal Selection Activity:**\n1. Read through all examples in each category\n2. On a sheet of paper, create three sections labeled \"Performance,\" \"Process,\" and \"Health\"\n3. In each section, write one specific goal that:\n\n- You can do in your available space\n- Requires minimal or no equipment\n- You find personally interesting\n4. For each goal, write down exactly how you'll measure success\n\n## Your Lifetime Fitness Vision\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nNow let's think about how physical activity fits into different stages of your life:\n\n### Middle School (Now)\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nWhich activities bring you joy today? What new physical skills interest you?\n\n### High School (A few years from now)\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nWhich sports might you explore? How will you stay active despite homework and other responsibilities?\n\n### Adult Life (Many years from now)\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nHow will you incorporate movement into your work life? Which activities can you enjoy for many years?\n\n<br/>\n![Image: Three simple illustrations showing people of different ages being active in different ways]\n\n## Create Your Fitness Timeline\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nLet's build your personal fitness timeline with these steps:\n\n<br/>\n1. Take a full sheet of paper and turn it horizontally\n2. Draw a horizontal line across the middle of your paper\n3. Mark three points: \"Now,\" \"High School,\" and \"Adult\"\n4. At each point, create a box and inside write or draw:\n\n- An activity you want to try\n- A performance goal\n- A process goal\n- A health goal\n\n**Example of a Completed Timeline Box:**\n```\nNOW\n\n**Safety Tip:** Set challenging but reasonable goals. Start small and gradually increase intensity.\n\n## Try It At Home\n\n### Materials You Need:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph or two so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Paper and colored pencils/markers\n- Ruler or straight edge (optional)\n- Small movement space (6x6 feet minimum)\n- Household alternatives: magazines for cutting images, sticky notes for goals, or digital options using a drawing app\n\n### Activity: Fitness Vision Board\n1. Gather your materials and find a flat surface to work on\n2. Divide your paper into 6-8 sections\n3. In each section, either:\n\n- Draw a simple picture of an activity you want to try\n- Write the name of the activity in bubble letters\n- If available, cut out magazine images that represent your activities\n4. Around each activity, write 2-3 words describing how you want to feel\n5. Add specific goals with deadlines (Example: \"10 push-ups by December\")\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- Can't think of activities? Look around your home for movement opportunities: stairs for climbing, hallways for lunges, doorways for stretching\n- Limited drawing skills? Use simple stick figures or just write the activity names in colorful letters\n- No magazines? Draw simple symbols (basketball, running shoes, bicycle) to represent activities\n\n**Completion Check:** Your vision board is complete when you have:\n- At least 4 different activities represented\n- A mix of current and future activities\n- At least 2 goals with specific targets\n- Words describing desired feelings\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Regular physical activity provides lifelong benefits including stronger muscles and bones, better mood, and improved health, while inactivity leads to weakness and increased health risks.\n- Setting specific performance goals (what your body can do), process goals (activity frequency), and health goals (how you want to feel) helps create a balanced fitness plan that grows with you.\n- Creating a personal fitness timeline and vision board helps you plan activities you enjoy from middle school through adulthood, making it more likely you'll maintain healthy habits for life.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
