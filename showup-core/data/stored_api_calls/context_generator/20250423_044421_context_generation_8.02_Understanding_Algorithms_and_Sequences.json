Follow these precise requirements:\n\n## TASK OVERVIEW\nGenerate 1-3 learning objectives for 11-14 year old students (6th grade reading level) and insert them after the main title using the proper edit commands.\n\n## TARGET AUDIENCE REQUIREMENTS\nThe content is for middle school students (grades 6-8):\n- VOCABULARY SIMPLICITY IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY\n- Keep all words under 8 letters when possible\n- Use concrete rather than abstract language\n- Avoid multi-syllable academic terms\n- Explain concepts using familiar examples\n- Assume this might be the student's first exposure to the topic\n\n## INSERTION INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Identify the insertion point:\n   - After the main title/heading (typically H1 or H2)\n   - Before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section\n\n2. Format the objectives exactly like this:\n```\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- [First objective with simple verb]\n- [Second objective with simple verb]\n- [Third objective with simple verb]\n\n```\n\n3. Maintain proper spacing:\n   - One empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - One empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Do not disrupt existing paragraph breaks\n\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS\n1. Maximum of 3 objectives per lesson\n2. Must be SMART:\n   - Specific: Clear, focused on one skill\n   - Measurable: Observable performance\n   - Achievable: Realistic for a 1-2 hour lesson\n   - Relevant: Directly tied to lesson content\n   - Time-bound: Accomplishable in one session\n\n3. Use these age-appropriate action verbs:\n   - **Simple Knowledge**: List, Name, Point to, Tell, Show\n   - **Basic Understanding**: Explain, Retell, Show how, Give examples\n   - **Application**: Use, Build, Make, Try, Show\n   - **Simple Analysis**: Sort, Group, Compare, Find reasons why\n   - **Creation**: Create, Make, Build, Put together\n   - **Choice-Making**: Pick the best, Rate, Choose, Decide\n\n## VOCABULARY SIMPLIFICATION RULES\n1. Replace any words over 8 letters with simpler alternatives\n2. Replace abstract concepts with concrete examples\n3. Eliminate academic jargon like \"differentiate,\" \"analyze,\" or \"evaluate\"\n4. Test each objective by asking: \"Would a 12-year-old understand every word?\"\n5. STRICTLY AVOID:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Academic terms (analyze, evaluate, differentiate, synthesize)\n   - Multiple skills in one objective\n   - Complex sentence structures with multiple clauses\n\n## RESPONSE FORMAT\nUse ONLY this edit command format:\n```\nINSERT AFTER LINE X:\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- [First simple objective]\n- [Second simple objective]\n- [Third simple objective]\n\n```\nWhere X is the line number after the title and before first content.\n\n## EXAMPLES OF PROPERLY SIMPLIFIED OBJECTIVES\n\n**Science Example**\nToo Academic: \"Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable energy sources.\"\nBetter: \"Sort energy types into two groups: ones that last forever and ones that run out.\"\n\n**Math Example**\nToo Academic: \"Apply proportional reasoning to solve problems.\"\nBetter: \"Use ratios to solve everyday math problems.\"\n\n**Language Arts Example**\nToo Academic: \"Analyze how word choice affects tone.\"\nBetter: \"Find words that make you feel happy, sad, or scared in a story.\"\n\n**History Example**\nToo Academic: \"Evaluate the impact of technological advancements.\"\nBetter: \"Show how new tools changed how people lived long ago.\"\n\n**Art Example**\nToo Academic: \"Demonstrate application of complementary colors.\"\nBetter: \"Show how to use colors that look good together.\"\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

Remember this is suppose to be read the below 3 bullet points where part of a recap in the lesson before this one. this linking paragraph should surve as a bridge between the two\n1. Programming gives robots precise, step-by-step instructions because robots cannot understand vague directions like humans can.\n2. The Input-Processing-Output model shows how robots take in information (like sensor readings), think about it (make decisions), and then act (move or make sounds).\n3. Programs use building blocks like variables, algorithms, and control structures to solve problems and help robots perform tasks.]\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n## Creating Step-by-Step Sequences\nThe key to writing effective algorithms is breaking down complex tasks into simple, clear steps. This process is called **decomposition** - taking a big problem and dividing it into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nWhen you decompose a problem, you're like a detective breaking down a mystery into smaller clues. For example, if you want to clean your room, you might break it down into: pick up clothes, put away books, make the bed, and vacuum the floor. Each of these steps is much easier to handle than \"clean the room\" as one big task.\n\n## The Importance of Precision\nComputers and robots can't make assumptions or fill in gaps like humans can. They follow instructions exactly as given. For example, if you tell a robot to \"make a sandwich\" without specifying the steps, it won't know what to do. Instead, you need to break this down into precise steps:\n1. Place bread on plate\n2. Spread butter on bread\n3. Add cheese on top of butter\n4. Place second slice of bread on top\n\nImagine telling your friend to \"go to the store.\" A human might ask \"Which store?\" or figure it out from context. But a robot would be completely lost! It needs to know exactly which store, how to get there, and what to do when it arrives. This is why precision matters so much in programming.\n\n### Sequence Structure\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%%\n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read]\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\nGood sequences have:\n- A clear beginning\n- Logical order of steps\n- Appropriate level of detail\n- A definite ending\n\nThink of a good sequence like a great story - it has a beginning that sets things up, a middle where all the action happens in the right order, and a satisfying ending that completes the task. When you write algorithms for robots, your \"story\" needs to be crystal clear so the robot can follow along perfectly.\n\n## Activity 1: Decompose a Simple Task\nChoose a simple everyday task like brushing teeth or making a paper airplane. Write out each step in extreme detail, as if explaining to someone who has never done it before. Try to be as precise as possible - remember, a computer can't infer missing steps! After writing your algorithm, try following it literally to see if you get the expected result or if you missed any steps.\n\n## Building Programs\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%%\n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read. this linking paragraph should serve as a bridge of the next lesson which learning objectives would be: \n1. Explain how block-based coding works using simple terms\n2. Build basic robot commands using visual blocks\n3. Find and fix common errors in block code.\nYou can add/fold your edits into this text as well: \n\" Now that we understand what algorithms are, let's see how they translate into programming. In a visual programming environment, we create sequences by connecting blocks that represent different actions. Visual programming is like building with LEGO blocks - you snap pieces together to create something amazing! Instead of writing complicated code with lots of symbols and words, you can drag and drop colorful blocks that represent different commands. This makes programming much easier to understand, especially when you're just starting out.\"]\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an introduction to algorithms and sequences, explaining the importance of breaking down complex tasks into clear, step-by-step instructions for robots and computers. It covers the concept of decomposition, the need for precision in programming, and the key elements of a good sequence structure. The content also includes an activity for learners to practice decomposing a simple task.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requires the addition of 1-3 learning objectives tailored for 11-14 year old students (6th grade reading level).
