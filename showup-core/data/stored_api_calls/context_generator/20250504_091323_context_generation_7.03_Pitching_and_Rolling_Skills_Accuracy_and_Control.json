Mastering them will significantly improve your hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness.\n\n## Materials\n- Rolled-up socks (3-4 pairs for multiple throws)\n- Small, soft balls (tennis balls, rubber balls)\n- Bean bags or small stuffed animals\n- Paper balls (made from crumpled newspaper covered with tape)\n- Household items for targets (empty water bottles, cardboard boxes, paper plates)\n\n**Equipment Alternatives:**\n- No soft balls? Use fruit-sized potatoes, oranges, or apples (with permission)\n- No bean bags? Fill a sock with rice or beans and tie it closed\n- No paper plates? Cut circles from cardboard boxes or draw circles on newspaper\n\n## Setting Up Your Practice Space\n1. Clear a space at least 10 feet long and 5 feet wide\n2. Remove breakable items and obstacles from the area\n3. Place a blanket or towel against a wall to stop rolling objects\n4. Mark throwing positions with tape, socks, or other markers at 3, 6, and 9 feet from targets\n5. Set up on carpet for slower rolling or hard floor for faster rolling\n6. For outdoor practice, find a flat surface away from windows\n\n## Warm-Up (5 minutes)\nGet your body ready with:\n1. Jog in place for 30 seconds until you feel warmth in your muscles\n2. Perform 10 arm circles forward and backward (count out loud to track)\n3. Complete 10 jumping jacks (or march in place if space is limited)\n4. Do high knees for 20-30 seconds (lift each knee to hip height)\n5. Perform side-to-side hops for 20-30 seconds (keep feet together)\n\n**Success Check:** Your warm-up is complete when:\n- Your breathing is slightly faster than normal\n- Your arms and legs feel looser\n- You can move your joints without stiffness\n\n## Rolling Technique\nMaster your rolling with these steps:\n\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent\n2. Hold your object (sock ball, soft ball) with both hands\n3. Focus your eyes on your target\n4. Swing the object back between your legs\n5. Shift your weight to your back foot\n6. Swing forward, releasing the object close to the ground\n7. Follow through with your swing while keeping your eyes on the target\n\n**Object Testing Activity:**\n1. Roll three different objects (sock ball, tennis ball, paper ball) toward a target\n2. Roll each object 5 times\n3. Record which object rolled straightest and which was easiest to control\n4. Note how the weight affected direction and speed in your practice journal\n\n**Troubleshooting Common Problems:**\n- Ball curves to the right: Try releasing with both hands exactly at the same time\n- Ball bounces too much: Release closer to the ground\n- Not enough power: Bend knees more and use a fuller backswing\n\n## Underhand Pitching Technique\nFor successful pitching:\n\n1. Stand with your stronger foot slightly forward\n2. Hold the object in your stronger hand\n3. Keep your eyes locked on your target\n4. Swing your arm back\n5. Step forward with your opposite foot as you swing your arm forward\n6. Release the object with a smooth motion\n7. Follow through with your arm pointing toward the target\n\n**Grip Testing Activity:**\n1. Try three different grips on the same object:\n   - Loose grip: Hold with fingertips only\n   - Medium grip: Hold with fingers wrapped around\n   - Firm grip: Squeeze the object while throwing\n2. Throw 5 times with each grip\n3. Record which grip gave you the most accuracy\n4. Note which grip worked best for different objects\n\n**Troubleshooting Common Problems:**\n- Throws going too high: Lower your release point\n- Not enough power: Step forward more deliberately\n- Poor accuracy: Keep your eyes fixed on the target throughout the entire throw\n\n## Skill Practice Activities\n\n### Target Challenge\n**Setup:**\n1. Place 5 targets (bottles, boxes) in a row, spaced 6 inches apart\n2. Mark throwing lines at 3, 6, and 9 feet from targets\n3. Assign point values: closest targets = 1 point, middle targets = 3 points, farthest targets = 5 points\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Start at the 3-foot line and throw 10 times, recording your score\n2. Move to the 6-foot line when you can hit targets 7 out of 10 times\n3. Move to the 9-foot line when you can hit targets 5 out of 10 times from 6 feet\n4. Compare rolling versus pitching by doing 10 of each and recording scores\n\n**Progress Tracking:**\nCreate a simple chart with columns for:\n- Distance (3ft, 6ft, 9ft)\n- Method (Roll, Pitch)\n- Score (out of possible 50 points)\n- Date\n\n### Accuracy Game\n**Setup:**\n1. Place 3 paper plates or draw 3 circles (6-inch diameter) on the ground\n2. Space them 1 foot apart in a triangle formation\n3. Mark throwing positions at 3, 5, and 7 feet away\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Throw 5 objects at each target (15 total throws)\n2. Score as follows:\n   - Object lands completely on target = 3 points\n   - Object partially on target = 1 point\n   - Object touches but rolls off = 0 points\n3. Record your score out of 45 possible points\n4. Practice at each distance until you score at least 30 points\n\n**Difficulty Options:**\n- Easier: Use larger targets or move closer\n- Harder: Use smaller targets or stand on one foot while throwing\n\n### Knock-Down Challenge\n**Setup:**\n1. Stack 6 empty plastic bottles or toilet paper rolls in a pyramid (3 on bottom, 2 in middle, 1 on top)\n2. Mark throwing positions at 4, 7, and 10 feet away\n3. Place a piece of tape on the floor as your boundary line\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Start at the 4-foot line\n2. Count how many throws it takes to knock down all items\n3. Reset and try again, attempting to use fewer throws\n4. Move back to the next distance when you can knock everything down in 3 or fewer throws\n5. Record your best score at each distance\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- If items won't stay stacked, place them on a book or tray\n- If objects roll away too far, set up against a wall\n- If you're struggling with accuracy, focus on hitting the bottom row first\n\n## Cool-Down and Self-Reflection (5-7 minutes)\nPerform these stretches while answering the reflection questions:\n\n1. Arm across chest stretch (hold 15 seconds each arm)\n   - Reflection: Which specific technique felt more natural to you and why?\n   \n2. Overhead tricep stretch (hold 15 seconds each arm)\n   - Reflection: List the top 3 objects that worked best for your throwing style.\n   \n3. Forward fold (touch toes, hold 15 seconds)\n   - Reflection: What specific adjustment helped most when you missed targets?\n   \n4. Shoulder rolls (10 forward, 10 backward)\n   - Reflection: Name two real-life activities where you could use these skills.\n\nWrite your answers in your practice journal.\n\n## Self-Assessment\nCheck your progress by completing this checklist:\n\n**Rolling Form:**\n- [ ] I keep my eyes on the target throughout the roll\n- [ ] I release the object close to the ground\n- [ ] I follow through with my swing after release\n- [ ] I can roll objects that travel in a straight line\n\n**Pitching Form:**\n- [ ] I step forward with my opposite foot when pitching\n- [ ] My arm follows through toward the target\n- [ ] I can control the speed of my pitch\n- [ ] I release the object smoothly without jerking\n\n**Accuracy Milestones:**\n- [ ] I can hit a target from 3 feet away at least 7 out of 10 times\n- [ ] I can hit a target from 6 feet away at least 5 out of 10 times\n- [ ] I can knock down a pyramid of objects in 5 or fewer throws\n- [ ] I can land objects on a paper plate target at least 10 out of 15 times\n\n## Home Practice Ideas\n- **Daily Target Practice:** Set up a target zone in a safe area and practice for 10 minutes daily\n- **Skills Journal:** Create a practice log with these columns:\n  - Date\n  - Activity\n  - Score/Result\n  - What Worked Well\n  - What To Improve\n- **Progressive Challenge:** Create an obstacle course where objects must roll around barriers to reach targets\n- **Weekly Goal Setting:** Set specific goals like \"Increase accuracy from 6 feet by 20%\" or \"Reduce throws needed for knock-down challenge\"\n\n**Example Practice Journal Entry:**\n```\nDate: October 12\nActivity: Target Challenge from 6 feet\nScore: 28/50\nWhat Worked Well: Loose grip on sock balls gave better control\nWhat To Improve: Need to follow through more consistently\nNext Session Goal: Score 35/50 from same distance\n```\n</CONTENT>\n",
