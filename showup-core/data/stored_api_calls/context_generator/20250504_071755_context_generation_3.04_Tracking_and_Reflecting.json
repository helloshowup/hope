These records help you make better exercise choices and build lasting healthy habits. The self-monitoring skills you develop won't just improve your fitness—they'll be useful in many other parts of your life too.\n\nYou'll need:\n- A cardio log worksheet (printable version available in your course materials)\n- A pencil or pen\n- A timer or stopwatch (or a phone with a timer app)\n- Comfortable clothes for movement\n\n## Let's Begin!\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Your Cardio Log (10 minutes)\nYour cardio log helps you keep track of your exercise sessions. In it, you'll write down:\n- The cardio activity you did (jumping jacks, running in place, etc.)\n- How long you exercised (minutes)\n- How difficult it felt (scale: 1=easy to 5=very challenging)\n- How you felt during and after (energized, tired, happy, etc.)\n\nTake a moment to look at your cardio log worksheet. Find each section where you'll record this information. Check the example in your materials to see what a completed entry looks like.\n\n### Step 2: Get Moving! (15-20 minutes)\nNow it's time to try some cardio! Here are some exercises you can do at home:\n\n- Jumping jacks: Stand with feet together, then jump while spreading your legs and raising your arms overhead.\n- High knees: Run in place while lifting your knees up high toward your chest.\n- Butt kicks: Jog in place while kicking your heels toward your bottom.\n- Mountain climbers: Get in push-up position, then bring your knees to your chest one at a time.\n\nChoose 3-4 exercises and do each for 1-2 minutes. Rest briefly between exercises if needed. Pay attention to how your body responds—notice your heartbeat, breathing, and which muscles you feel working. Some activities might feel easier or harder for you than others.\n\n### Step 3: Record Your Activity (5 minutes)\nFill out your cardio log right after you finish exercising. Be honest about how the workout felt—this record is for you to learn about yourself, not to impress anyone else!\n\n### Step 4: Over to You (10 minutes)\nThink about your workout experience and answer these questions in your notebook:\n- Which activities did you enjoy most? Why?\n- Which activities felt the most challenging?\n- How did your body feel during different parts of the workout?\n- How do you feel now, after completing the workout?\n- What might you do differently next time?\n\n### Step 5: Set a Personal Cardio Goal (10 minutes)\nUsing what you learned today, create one specific cardio fitness goal. A good goal follows the SMART format:\n\n- Specific: Exactly what you want to accomplish\n- Measurable: How you'll know if you've reached it\n- Achievable: Something you can realistically do\n- Relevant: Important to you personally\n- Time-bound: When you plan to achieve it\n\nFor example: \"I will do 10 minutes of jumping jacks and high knees three times a week for the next two weeks.\"\n\nWrite your goal in your cardio log. If possible, share your goal with a family member—telling someone else about it helps you stick with it.\n\n## Wrap-Up\nToday you learned how to track and reflect on your cardio activities. Your cardio log will help you spot patterns, set effective goals, and adjust your routine to improve your fitness. This self-monitoring approach helps build exercise habits that last.\n\nNext time, we'll explore different muscle groups and how they work together during exercise. Your cardio log will connect what you've learned about heart fitness with our upcoming focus on strength and flexibility.\n\n## Check Your Understanding\nTracking your cardio activities shows your progress over time and helps you make smarter exercise choices. When you record your activity type, exercise duration, difficulty level, and how you felt, you can spot patterns that reveal what works best for your body. \n\nEffective fitness goals follow the SMART format: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. The cardio tracking you're doing now will connect to our next lesson by showing how different exercises affect specific muscles and your overall fitness.\n\n## Take It Further\n- Use your cardio log at home to track walking, dancing, or active games\n- Design a personal cover for your cardio log to make it your own\n- Ask a family member how they keep track of their exercise or health habits\n- Look up different apps or websites that help people monitor fitness activities\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Tracking your cardio workouts helps you identify patterns and make better exercise choices that lead to lasting healthy habits.\n- Creating SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) gives your fitness journey clear direction and increases your chances of success.\n- Paying attention to how your body feels during and after exercise provides valuable feedback to guide your future workout decisions.\n</CONTENT>\n",
