Predictable comparison structures (\"think of X as Y\", \"imagine X is Y\")\n2. Overused intensifiers and generic language\n3. Formulaic transition phrases\n4. Artificial enthusiasm markers\n5. Repetitive explanation patterns\n\n## REFINEMENT REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - Preserve all educational substance and learning objectives\n   - Maintain the overall document structure and organization\n   \n2. PATTERN ELIMINATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks\n   - Substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions\n   - Convert formulaic transitions to natural connections\n   - Replace artificial excitement markers with inherently interesting content\n   - Eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clichés\n   \n3. AUTHENTIC VOICE ENHANCEMENT (SUPPORTING):\n   - Vary sentence structure and length throughout\n   - Replace generic explanations with specific examples\n   - Add natural language variations and conversational elements\n   - Create authentic progression between ideas\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Maintain exact section headings and structural elements\n2. Focus exclusively on language patterns and voice authenticity\n3. Preserve all educational substance while enhancing authenticity\n4.

What snacks do you usually have before playing sports or being active? Many professional athletes carefully choose what they eat before competing. Today's lesson will explore how different foods provide energy and building blocks for movement, play, and strength development.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs are your body's preferred fuel - similar to petrol in a car\n   - Found in foods like bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body breaks them down into glucose (sugar) that powers your muscles\n   - Without enough carbs, you might feel tired or weak during activities\n   - Try it yourself: Do 10 jumping jacks, then notice how your body used carbs to power that movement\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n   - Proteins are like building blocks that help repair and grow your muscles\n   - Found in foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts\n   - When you exercise, tiny tears form in your muscles - protein helps fix them\n   - This repair process is what makes your muscles stronger over time\n   - Picture this: Just like a growing plant gets bigger and stronger over time, your muscles grow when you give them protein after exercise\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n   - Healthy fats are like slow-burning candles that provide energy for longer activities\n   - Found in avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish\n   - Fats also protect your organs and help your body absorb certain vitamins\n   - Your brain needs fats to work properly too!\n   - Note: While fats are important, we need smaller amounts compared to carbs and protein\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n- Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or pictures of foods from magazines or printed from the internet)\n- Sort these items into three groups - \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n- For mixed foods (like pizza), think about which nutrients they contain the most\n- Check your answers using food labels or by searching online\n- Remember: Many foods contain more than one nutrient!\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  * 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  * 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  * After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- Create a \"Perfect Plate\" model showing:\n  * 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  * 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  * 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  * Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Examples of balanced meals and snacks you can easily make:\n  * Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  * Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  * Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  * Chocolate milk after a workout (natural protein and carbs!)\n\n## Over to You \n- Test your knowledge: Make a list of 5 nutrient functions you learned today and check if they're correct\n- Create a \"My Performance Plate\" drawing showing what you would eat:\n  * Before your favourite physical activity\n  * After your favourite physical activity\n- Challenge yourself: Try one new performance-boosting food this week and write down how it made you feel\n- Remember: \"The food you eat is the fuel for everything you do. Choose your fuel wisely to perform your best!\"\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the three main nutrients - carbohydrates, proteins, and fats - and how they power the body for physical activity. It covers the role and sources of each nutrient, as well as guidance on timing meals and snacks for optimal performance. The content includes a hands-on activity for students to practice identifying nutrient groups in different foods.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. **Structure and Substance Preservation (Critical)**: Maintain all original section headings and preserve the educational substance and learning objectives.\n2. **Pattern Elimination (Important)**: Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks, substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions, convert formulaic transitions to natural connections, replace artificial enthusiasm markers, and eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clichés.\n3. **Authentic Voice Enhancement (Supporting)**: Vary sentence structure and length, replace generic explanations with specific examples, add natural language variations and conversational elements, and create authentic progression between ideas.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- **Age Range**: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Reading Level**: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Prior Knowledge**: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style**: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment**: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds, keep sentences short (15-20 words), write in active voice and present tense, and define necessary fitness terms immediately. The structure should include frequent headings, numbered steps, and bullet points to create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained and optimized for independent learning without relying on external resources or live instruction.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the original educational substance and learning objectives while enhancing the authenticity of the language and voice.\n- Eliminate predictable patterns, generic language, and artificial enthusiasm to create a more natural, engaging tone.\n- Adapt the content to the target learner's reading level, prior knowledge, and learning preferences, including visual elements, hands-on activities, and real-world connections.\n- Ensure the content is self-contained and can be effectively delivered through the asynchronous online medium without requiring additional resources or live instruction.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify the core themes, concepts, and learning objectives.\n2. Analyze the enhancement prompt and extract the specific requirements for pattern elimination and authentic voice enhancement.\n3. Carefully consider the target learner profile, including their age, reading level, prior knowledge, learning style, and physical environment, and adapt the content accordingly.\n4. Preserve the original educational substance and structure while replacing predictable language patterns with more natural, varied expressions.\n5. Enhance the authenticity of the content by adding specific examples, conversational elements, and a friendly, relatable tone, while avoiding generic explanations or artificial enthusiasm.\n6. Ensure the content is self-contained and can be effectively delivered through the asynchronous online medium without requiring additional resources or live instruction.\n7. Review the enhanced content to verify that it maintains the original educational integrity, addresses the enhancement requirements, and is appropriately adapted for the target learner and learning medium."
