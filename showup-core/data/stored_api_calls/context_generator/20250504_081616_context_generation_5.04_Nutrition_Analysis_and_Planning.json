Now, let's examine YOUR eating habits and set some personal nutrition goals that will help fuel your activities and make you feel fantastic!\n\n## Lesson Objectives\nAfter this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Figure out what's working (and what's not) in your current eating habits\n- Create your own personal nutrition goals that make sense for YOU\n- Develop a simple plan to make healthier food choices that fit your life\n- Overcome common challenges that might get in your way\n\n## Activity: Food Detective Work\nTime to become nutrition detectives and investigate our own eating habits!\n\n**Step 1: Food Tracking (1 day)**\n- Track everything you eat and drink for ONE day using our \"Food Detective\" worksheet\n- Write down WHAT you ate, WHEN you ate it, and HOW you felt afterward\n- Don't worry about counting calories or being perfect - just be honest!\n\n**Step 2: Food Group Analysis**\n- Look at your food log and sort your foods into the MyPlate categories:\n  * Fruits: How many different colours did you eat?\n  * Vegetables: Did you get at least 3 servings?\n  * Grains: Were they mostly whole grains?\n  * Protein: Did you have protein at most meals?\n  * Dairy/Calcium-rich foods: Did you include these?\n- Circle foods that gave you energy and put a star next to foods that made you feel sluggish\n\n**Step 3: Goal Setting**\n- Based on your food detective work, choose ONE area you want to improve\n- Create a specific, doable goal using our \"SMART Goal Builder\":\n  * Example: \"I will add a fruit or vegetable to my after-school snack at least 4 days this week\"\n  * NOT: \"I will eat healthier\" (too vague!)\n- Share your goal with a partner who can help keep you on track\n\n## Common Challenges and Solutions\nMiddle school life can make healthy eating tricky! Here are some real solutions:\n\n**Challenge: No time because of homework and activities**\n- Solution: Create a \"Grab & Go\" snack box with healthy options you can take anywhere\n- Solution: Prep simple snacks on the weekend (like cutting up veggies or portioning trail mix)\n\n**Challenge: Limited access to kitchen or cooking tools**\n- Solution: Learn these no-cook power snacks: apple + peanut butter, yoghurt parfait, veggie wraps\n- Solution: Keep a water bottle with you to stay hydrated without needing a kitchen\n\n**Challenge: Weather keeps you inside**\n- Solution: Indoor movement breaks (5-minute dance party, quick stretching)\n- Solution: Fuel indoor activities with brain-boosting foods like nuts, berries, and whole grains\n\n**Challenge: Just not feeling motivated**\n- Solution: Team up with a friend to try one new healthy food each week\n- Solution: Notice how different foods affect your energy for activities you enjoy\n- Solution: Create a fun chart to track your progress and celebrate small wins\n\n## Action Plan\nNow it's time to put your goal into action!\n\n1. Fill out your \"Nutrition Action Plan\" worksheet:\n   - Write your SMART goal at the top\n   - List 3 specific actions you'll take this week\n   - Identify who can support you (friend, family member, teacher)\n   - Plan how you'll track your progress (chart, journal, app)\n\n2. Buddy Check-In:\n   - Share your plan with a partner\n   - Give each other feedback and suggestions\n   - Schedule a time to catch up with each other later this week\n\n## Over to You\nThink about how the foods you eat affect how you feel during the day. When do you feel most energised? When do you feel tired? What patterns do you notice about your eating habits? Write down two things you learned about yourself from this food detective work.\n\n## Conclusion\nRemember, making small changes to your eating habits can have a BIG impact on how you feel and perform in sports, school, and life! Next class, we'll learn about the FITT Principle, which will help you design your own personal fitness plan. Your nutrition goals from today will work together with your fitness plan to help you feel your best!\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
