Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Find an open space in your home where you can safely move around (at least 6x6 feet)\n\n### Getting Started: Ability Awareness Activity\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a two paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Find an open space in your home where you can safely move around (at least 6x6 feet)\n2. Gather these materials:\n\n- A soft object like a sock ball, small stuffed animal, or balloon\n- A chair\n- Optional: an eye patch or bandana (for the vision limitation)\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Toss and catch your soft object 10 times using only one hand (keep the other behind your back)\n2. Sit down (on the floor or in a chair) and toss and catch your object 10 times\n3. Look through one eye (close or cover the other) and toss and catch your object 10 times\n\n**Reflection Task:** After completing all three variations, complete this chart:\n\n| Limitation | Easy, Medium, or Hard? | What made it challenging? | What would help? |\n|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| One hand   |                        |                           |                  |\n| Sitting    |                        |                           |                  |\n| One eye    |                        |                           |                  |\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If tossing is too difficult, try rolling the object on the floor instead\n- If you don't have enough space, reduce the height of your tosses\n- If you're finding it too easy, increase the distance of your tosses\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Set a timer for 10 minutes\n\n### Accessibility Scavenger Hunt \n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Prepare a simple recording method (paper and pencil, phone camera, or voice recorder)\n2. Set a timer for 10 minutes\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Search your home for at least 5 features that help make activities accessible\n\n- Examples include:\n- Ramps or wide doorways\n- Pictures or visual instructions (like on appliances)\n- Objects with different sizes, weights, or textures\n- Open spaces that allow various movement types\n- Handles that are easy to grip\n- Adjustable features (like chair heights)\n\n2. For each item you find, record:\n\n- What it is (description or photo)\n- Who it might help and how\n- Whether it was designed to be accessible or just happens to be\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Found at least 5 accessibility features\n- Identified who benefits from each feature\n- Explained how each feature makes participation easier\n\n**Alternative Option:** If mobility is limited, focus on one room and examine objects in detail, or browse a home improvement website to identify accessible features.\n\n### Principles of Inclusive Game Design\n\nNow that you've explored accessibility in your environment, let's look at four key principles that make games work better for everyone:\n\n<br/>\n1. **Multiple Ways to Play**: Games need different roles and participation options\n\n   *Example*: During basketball, players might shoot, pass, coach, or keep score\n\n2. **Adjustable Challenge Levels**: Games should be easy to modify for different skill levels\n\n   *Example*: In target games, players choose their distance from the target\n\n3. **Teamwork Over Competition**: Focus on collaboration rather than just winning\n\n   *Example*: Group challenges where players try to beat their previous best score\n\n4. **Adaptations for Different Abilities**: Modify rules or equipment to include everyone\n\n   *Example*: Using beach balls instead of volleyballs, or creating seated versions of standing games\n\n**Application Task:** \n1. Choose a game you're familiar with (like soccer, tag, or board games)\n2. Complete this chart:\n\n| Principle | How it appears (or doesn't) in your game | How you could add or improve it |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Multiple Ways to Play |  |  |\n| Adjustable Challenge |  |  |\n| Teamwork Focus |  |  |\n| Adaptations |  |  |\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Find a quiet space where you can think and plan\n2. Set aside 20-30 minutes for this activity\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Gather paper and something to write/draw with\n2. Find a quiet space where you can think and plan\n3. Set aside 20-30 minutes for this activity\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n1. Select one of these common games to redesign:\n\n- Tag\n- Relay races\n- Basketball\n- Dodgeball\n\n2. First, analyze the original game by completing this table:\n\n| Potential Barriers | Who Might Be Excluded | Why This Is a Problem |\n|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Example: Running speed | People with mobility limitations | They can't compete fairly |\n| 1. |  |  |\n| 2. |  |  |\n| 3. |  |  |\n\n<br/>\n3. Create your inclusive version by making specific changes:\n\n| Principle | Your Specific Adaptation | Materials Needed |\n|-----------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| Multiple Ways to Play |  | |\n| Adjustable Challenge |  | |\n| Teamwork Focus |  | |\n| Adaptations |  | |\n\n<br/>\n4. Write clear, step-by-step instructions for your new game:\n\n- How to set up the game\n- Rules for play\n- How to determine success/completion\n- Safety considerations\n\n5. Draw a simple diagram showing your game in action, labeling:\n\n- Playing area\n- Player positions/roles\n- Equipment\n- Any adaptations\n\n**Example of a Completed Game Redesign:**\n```\nGAME: Inclusive Tag\nSETUP: Define a play area with household items as boundaries\nADAPTATIONS:\n\n- Players can move by walking, crawling, or scooting\n- \"Tagging\" can be done with a pool noodle to increase distance\n- Players can wear colored bands to indicate their speed level\n- \"Safe zones\" available for players who need breaks\nMATERIALS: Pool noodle or soft item, colored bands (optional), items for boundaries\n```\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you're stuck, think about a game you've played that felt unfair and fix those issues\n- Consider how the game could work with just 2-3 players\n- Think about adaptations for different home spaces (small apartments vs. larger homes)\n\n### Game Documentation and Testing\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Set up your game in an available space\n1. Prepare your game instructions and diagram from the previous activity\n2. Set up your game in an available space\n3.
