Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

The foods you eat before playing basketball, running in PE class, or riding bikes with friends affect both how well you perform and how you feel afterward. Eating the right foods at the right times gives you energy to play longer, helps build stronger muscles, and speeds up how quickly you recover.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and berries provide quick energy and important vitamins\n- **Vegetables**: Carrots, broccoli, and spinach contain minerals and vitamins that keep your body working properly\n- **Grains**: Bread, pasta, and rice fuel your activities with long-lasting energy (brown and whole grain versions work best)\n- **Protein**: Chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts help repair and build your muscles\n- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain calcium that strengthens your bones\n\nWhen you include foods from each group in your meals, your body gets all the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and active.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nEating a small snack 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body fuel to perform well. Try these pre-workout snacks:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- **Banana with peanut butter**: Bananas provide quick energy while peanut butter adds protein that helps that energy last\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: The fruit gives immediate energy while cheese adds staying power\n- **Yogurt with berries**: This combination digests easily and provides both quick and sustained energy\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These complex carbohydrates release energy steadily during your activity\n\nKeep your pre-workout snack small - just enough to fuel you without feeling heavy in your stomach. If you eat too much right before exercise, you might feel uncomfortable or get a stomach ache.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nYour body needs specific nutrients after exercise to recover properly. Eating within 30 minutes after finishing activity helps your muscles rebuild stronger. \n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\nGood recovery foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: This tasty drink contains an excellent ratio of carbohydrates to protein that helps muscles recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The lean meat repairs muscle tissue while the wrap replenishes energy stores\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Blending these ingredients creates an easy-to-digest mix of proteins and carbs\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: This Middle Eastern combo provides plant protein and energy-restoring carbohydrates\n\nDrink plenty of water after sweating! Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster and prevents dehydration, which can cause headaches and tiredness.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding food labels is a key skill that helps you make smarter food choices. Food labels reveal what's actually in the products you buy. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)\n- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body\n- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones\n- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources\n- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed\n\n## Food Label Comparison Activity\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Find two similar snack items in your kitchen (examples: two granola bars, two types of crackers, or two breakfast cereals)\n2. Place them side by side on a table with good lighting\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready, or use a digital note-taking app\n4. If you don't have similar snacks available, use online images of nutrition labels (search \"nutrition label granola bar\" for examples)\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Create a simple comparison chart with these categories:\n\n- Product name\n- Serving size\n- Calories per serving\n- Protein amount\n- Carbohydrate amount\n- Sugar amount\n- Number of ingredients\n\n2. Fill in your chart with information from both food labels\n\n<br/>\n3. Answer these specific questions:\n\n- Which snack has more protein per serving?\n- Which has fewer added sugars?\n- Which has more recognizable ingredients?\n- Which would provide quicker energy? Which would provide longer-lasting energy?\n\n### Success Criteria:\nYou've successfully completed this activity when you have:\n\n- Filled in all categories in your comparison chart\n- Answered all four analysis questions\n- Identified which snack would work better before exercise and which would be better after exercise, with at least two specific reasons for each choice\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n\n- If you can't find the added sugar amount, look at the ingredients list - ingredients are listed by quantity, so if sugar appears early in the list, there's likely more of it\n- If you don't have food items available, ask a family member to describe labels to you or use online resources\n- If you're unsure about an ingredient, look it up online to learn what it is\n\n## MyPlate Tracking Activity\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Get a piece of paper and drawing supplies (pencil, markers, or crayons)\n2. Set up a quiet space where you can think about your meals from today or yesterday\n3. Draw a large circle on your paper to represent a plate\n4. Divide your circle into four sections, with a small circle beside it (like the MyPlate model)\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. For each meal you ate today (or yesterday):\n\n- Draw a new plate diagram\n- Label the sections: Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, and Protein, with Dairy beside the plate\n- Color in how much of each food group you actually ate (for example, if half your breakfast was eggs, color in half the protein section)\n\n2. After completing all your meal plates, answer these reflection questions:\n\n- Which food group did you eat the most of throughout the day?\n- Which food group might you need to include more of tomorrow?\n- Name one specific change you could make to better balance your plate at a particular meal\n\n### Success Criteria:\nYou've successfully completed this activity when you have:\n\n- Created plate diagrams for at least three meals\n- Accurately represented the proportions of food groups in each meal\n- Answered all three reflection questions\n- Identified at least one specific, realistic change to improve your meal balance\n\n### Example of a Completed Plate:\nBreakfast Plate:\n\n- Protein section (1/4 filled): Scrambled eggs\n- Grains section (1/2 filled): Toast\n- Fruits section (1/4 filled): Banana slices\n- Vegetables section (empty)\n- Dairy circle (1/2 filled): Glass of milk\n\nNow that you understand these nutrition concepts, you can see how the foods you choose before and after being active directly affect your energy levels, strength, and recovery. Using the MyPlate model as a guide, selecting appropriate snacks for before and after exercise, and understanding food labels helps you make better choices. When you fuel your body properly, you'll have more stamina, build stronger muscles, and bounce back faster from all your physical activities!\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your body needs different foods before and after exercise - quick energy snacks before activity and protein-rich foods after to help muscles recover.\n- The MyPlate model helps you create balanced meals with fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy to fuel your active lifestyle.\n- Reading food labels helps you make smarter choices by comparing serving sizes, calories, protein content, and ingredients between similar products.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
