You'll discover physical activities that match your interests and abilities, helping you develop healthy habits that last. Through hands-on exploration and self-reflection, you'll learn about different types of lifetime activities and how to include them in your daily routines.\n\n### Warm-Up Activity\nComplete this \"Would You Rather\" activity by writing down your choices:\n1. Circle one: I would rather go [hiking] OR [play frisbee in the park]\n2. Circle one: I would rather [learn a dance routine] OR [try yoga]\n3. Circle one: I would rather [play backyard games with family] OR [go for a bike ride]\n\nNow, write 1-2 sentences explaining WHY you chose each activity. For example: \"I chose hiking because I enjoy being in nature and seeing new places.\"\n\n### Exploring Lifetime Recreation Activities\nLifetime recreation activities are physical activities people can enjoy at any age - beyond just competitive sports. These activities:\n- Can be done alone or with others\n- Don't require expensive equipment\n- Can be adjusted for different fitness levels\n- Are enjoyable and reduce stress\n\nLet's look at four categories of lifetime activities to explore:\n\n1. **Walking/Jogging Programs**\n   - **How to do it properly**: Keep your head up, shoulders relaxed, and arms swinging naturally when walking or jogging\n   - **Getting started**: Begin with 10 minutes daily and slowly build up your time\n   - **Tracking progress**: Count laps around your living room/yard OR use a step counter app if available\n   - **Equipment needed**: Comfortable shoes (any athletic shoes or even sturdy everyday shoes will work)\n   - **Space requirements**: A clear path of at least 10 steps in any direction\n\n2. **Backyard Games**\n   - **Basic games**: Badminton, cornhole, and frisbee work in any open space at home\n   - **Equipment alternatives**: \n     * Instead of cornhole: Use a laundry basket and rolled-up socks\n     * Instead of frisbee: Use a paper plate with the middle cut out\n     * Instead of badminton: Balloon volleyball with your hands\n   - **Space setup**: Clear a 6x6 foot area (about the size of a small bedroom rug)\n   - **Skill focus**: These games build hand-eye coordination while keeping setup simple\n\n3. **Dance Activities**\n   - **Getting started**: Clear a space where you can take 2 steps in any direction\n   - **Learning resources**: Free dance tutorials on YouTube (search \"beginner dance tutorial\")\n   - **Simple first moves**: March in place, side steps, arm waves\n   - **No-tech option**: Put on your favorite song and create 4 moves that repeat\n   - **Health benefits**: Dancing builds both coordination and heart health\n\n4. **Yoga and Stretching**\n   - **Setup needs**: A towel or blanket on a flat surface\n   - **Beginner poses with instructions**:\n     * Mountain pose: Stand tall with feet together, arms at sides\n     * Tree pose: Balance on one foot, place other foot on ankle or calf (not knee)\n     * Child's pose: Kneel and sit back on heels, stretch arms forward\n   - **Breathing technique**: Count to 4 during inhales and exhales for calming breaths\n   - **Modifications**: Can be done seated in a chair if needed\n\n### Activity Stations Setup Guide\nSet up these stations in your home. You'll need:\n\n**General setup**:\n- Timer (phone, clock, or count in your head)\n- Water bottle\n- Space to move safely (move furniture if needed)\n- Activity tracking sheet (paper where you'll record your results)\n\nSpend 5-6 minutes at each station:\n\n**Station 1: Walking/Jogging Challenge**\n- **Setup**: Find a safe walking path (around a coffee table, along a hallway, or in your yard)\n- **Task**: Walk with proper form (head up, shoulders back) for 5 minutes\n- **Progress tracking**: Count how many laps/lengths you complete\n- **Success criteria**: You should be breathing harder but still able to talk\n- **Modifications**:\n  * Easier: Just focus on good posture while walking slowly\n  * Harder: Add jogging intervals (jog for 10 steps, walk for 20)\n\n**Station 2: Backyard Games**\n- **Setup**: Place a basket/bucket 5 steps away from a starting line\n- **Materials**: 5 pairs of rolled socks or small soft objects\n- **Task**: Throw objects into the target, retrieving after each round\n- **Progress tracking**: Record your score out of 5 for each round\n- **Success criteria**: Complete 3 rounds, with improvement in at least one round\n- **Modifications**:\n  * Easier: Move closer to the target\n  * Harder: Step back 2 more steps from the target\n\n**Station 3: Dance Zone**\n- **Setup**: Clear space where you won't bump into anything\n- **Task**: Create a 4-count move and repeat it 8 times\n  1. Choose a simple move (step-touch, march, arm wave)\n  2. Practice it 4 times slowly\n  3. Repeat with music if available\n- **Progress tracking**: Record how many 8-count repetitions you completed\n- **Success criteria**: Perform your move 8 times in a row without stopping\n- **Modifications**:\n  * Easier: Do moves while seated\n  * Harder: Create a second move and alternate between them\n\n**Station 4: Yoga Corner**\n- **Setup**: Lay out a towel or blanket on a flat surface\n- **Task**: Hold each pose below for 30 seconds (count slowly)\n  1. Mountain pose\n  2. Forward fold (bend at hips, reaching toward toes)\n  3. Tree pose (hold onto wall if needed)\n  4. Child's pose\n- **Progress tracking**: Record which poses you completed and for how long\n- **Success criteria**: Hold each pose with steady breathing\n- **Modifications**:\n  * Easier: Hold poses for 15 seconds instead of 30\n  * Harder: Add a fifth pose - Warrior I (step one foot back, bend front knee)\n\n### Finding Your Fit Reflection\nAfter trying each activity, complete this chart:\n\n| Activity | Enjoyment Rating (1-5) | Could I do this weekly? (Yes/No) | One way to make it more fun |\n|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Walking/Jogging | | | |\n| Backyard Games | | | |\n| Dance | | | |\n| Yoga | | | |\n\nThen answer: Which activity had the highest rating and why? Write 2-3 sentences explaining what you liked about it.\n\n### Family Involvement Plan\nCreate a specific plan to share one activity with your family by completing this template:\n\n**My Family Activity Plan**\n1.
