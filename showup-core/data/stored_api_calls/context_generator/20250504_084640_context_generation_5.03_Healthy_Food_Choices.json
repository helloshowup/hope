The foods you eat before playing basketball, running in PE class, or riding bikes with friends affect both how well you perform and how you feel afterward. Eating the right foods at the right times gives you energy to play longer, helps build stronger muscles, and speeds up how quickly you recover.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model uses a simple plate diagram to show what balanced meals look like. A healthy plate includes:\n- **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and berries provide quick energy and important vitamins\n- **Vegetables**: Carrots, broccoli, and spinach contain minerals and vitamins that keep your body working properly\n- **Grains**: Bread, pasta, and rice fuel your activities with long-lasting energy (brown and whole grain versions work best)\n- **Protein**: Chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts help repair and build your muscles\n- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain calcium that strengthens your bones\n\nWhen you include foods from each group in your meals, your body gets all the nutrients it needs.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nEating a small snack 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body fuel to perform well. Try these pre-workout snacks:\n\n- **Banana with peanut butter**: Bananas provide quick energy while peanut butter adds protein that helps that energy last\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: The fruit gives immediate energy while cheese adds staying power\n- **Yogurt with berries**: This combination digests easily and provides both quick and sustained energy\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These complex carbohydrates release energy steadily during your activity\n\nKeep your pre-workout snack small - just enough to fuel you without feeling heavy in your stomach.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nYour body needs specific nutrients after exercise to recover properly. Eating within 30 minutes after finishing activity helps your muscles rebuild stronger. Good recovery foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: This tasty drink contains an excellent ratio of carbohydrates to protein that helps muscles recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The lean meat repairs muscle tissue while the wrap replenishes energy stores\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Blending these ingredients creates an easy-to-digest mix of proteins and carbs\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: This Middle Eastern combo provides plant protein and energy-restoring carbohydrates\n\nDrink plenty of water after sweating! Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels reveal what's actually in the products you buy. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)\n- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body\n- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones\n- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources\n- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed\n\n## Over to You\nFind two similar snacks in your kitchen. Compare their labels side by side. Which would work better before playing sports? Which seems better for after? Write down your reasoning. You might also track your food for a day by drawing a plate for each meal and marking which food groups you included. This visual record shows whether you're getting a good balance according to the MyPlate model.\n\nThe foods you choose before and after being active directly affect your energy levels, strength, and recovery. Using the MyPlate model as a guide, selecting appropriate snacks for before and after exercise, and understanding food labels helps you make better choices. When you fuel your body properly, you'll have more stamina, build stronger muscles, and bounce back faster from all your physical activities!\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
