Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

For example, the robot can stop when it detects an object in its path.\"\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 1.2\n# The Input-Processing-Output Model\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n\n- Identify the different types of sensors robots use to gather information from their environment\n- Explain how a robot's processing system works to make decisions based on sensor data\n- Describe how actuators allow robots to take action and respond to their surroundings\n\n### Input: How Robots Sense\n\nRobots use **sensors** to gather information about their environment—this is the \"input\" part of our model. Sensors function like the robot's eyes, ears, and sense of touch, allowing it to perceive the world around it.\n\nRobots use many types of sensors:\n\n- **Light sensors** detect brightness levels, colors, or even take pictures\n- **Sound sensors** pick up noises and voices\n- **Touch sensors** detect when something makes physical contact with the robot\n- **Distance sensors** measure how far away objects are\n- **Temperature sensors** detect heat levels\n- **Motion sensors** detect nearby movement\n\nFor example, a robot vacuum uses sensors to detect walls and furniture to avoid bumping into them. It might also have sensors to spot particularly dirty areas of your floor that need extra cleaning. Without these sensors, the robot would be \"blind\" and unable to navigate effectively.\n\nThe quality and variety of sensors a robot has determine how much information it can gather about its world—similar to how having both eyes and ears gives you more information than having just one sense.\n\n> **CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? Think about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n\n### Processing: How Robots Think\n\nOnce a robot collects information through its sensors, it needs to make sense of that data and decide what to do. This is the \"processing\" part of our model—essentially the robot's brain.\n\nThe **processing system** in a robot typically consists of a computer or microcontroller running software. This software contains instructions that tell the robot how to interpret sensor data and what actions to take in different situations.\n\nFor example, when a robot vacuum's sensors detect a wall, its processing system:\n\n1. Recognizes the sensor data as indicating an obstacle\n2. Calculates a new path to avoid the obstacle\n3. Decides which direction to turn\n4. Sends commands to its motors to execute the turn\n\nSome robots have simple processing systems that follow basic if-then rules: \"If sensor detects obstacle, then turn right.\" Others use sophisticated **artificial intelligence** that can learn from experience and adapt to new situations.\n\nThe processing capability gives robots their \"smarts\" and allows them to make decisions without human intervention. Without this thinking ability, a machine would just be a remote-controlled device following direct human commands.\n\n### Output: How Robots Act\n\nAfter sensing and processing, robots need to do something—this is the \"output\" part of our model. Robots act on their environment through devices called **actuators**, which convert electrical energy into physical movement or other actions.\n\nCommon types of actuators include:\n\n- **Motors** that spin wheels, move arms, or turn gears\n- **Speakers** that produce sounds or speech\n- **Lights** that provide visual signals\n- **Grippers** that can grab and manipulate objects\n- **Pumps** that can move liquids or air\n\nFor instance, a drone robot uses motor actuators to spin its propellers at different speeds, allowing it to fly in various directions. A robot designed to help elderly people might use speaker actuators to provide verbal reminders about medications.\n\nThe actions a robot can perform determine its usefulness for specific tasks. A robot with precise arm movements might be perfect for surgery but useless for vacuuming floors. The combination of sensing, thinking, and acting capabilities defines what jobs a robot can handle effectively.\n\n## Check your understanding\n\nWhich component of the input-processing-output model allows a robot to make decisions based on information from its environment? \n\nA. Input \nB. Processing \nC. Output \nD. Actuators \n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\n**Answer:** The correct answer is B. Processing. The processing component (the robot's \"brain\") is what allows a robot to make decisions based on the information gathered by its sensors. Input refers to how robots gather information through sensors, and output refers to how robots act through actuators. Actuators are specifically output devices that allow robots to take physical action, but they don't make decisions. If you selected a different answer, review the three parts of the input-processing-output model that define a robot.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots use sensors (like light, sound, touch, and distance sensors) as their \"eyes and ears\" to understand the world around them.\n- The processing system acts as the robot's \"brain,\" using software to interpret data and decide what to do next.\n- Actuators (such as motors, speakers, and lights) are the robot's \"muscles\" that allow it to move and interact with its environment.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
