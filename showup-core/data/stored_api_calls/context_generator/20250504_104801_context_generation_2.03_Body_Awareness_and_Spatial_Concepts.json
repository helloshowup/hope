Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

These skills help you move safely and effectively, giving you the building blocks needed for sports, games, and everyday movement. \n\nLet's build on what we learned about non-locomotor movements as we prepare for upcoming balance and coordination activities.\n\n## Home Setup Instructions\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\nBefore starting this lesson, you'll need:\n\n- An open area approximately 6x6 feet (minimum)\n- 3 pieces of paper and a marker for making signs\n- A timer or stopwatch (phone timer works great)\n- Optional: Music player\n- Comfortable clothes that allow movement\n\nIf space is limited:\n\n- Focus on stationary movements and smaller steps\n- Use a hallway for directional movements\n- Clear a small area of furniture temporarily\n\n## Personal vs. General Space\nHere's the difference:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n**Personal space**: The area around your body that moves with you - about arm's length in all directions\n\n**General space**: The shared area you move through - like the open space in your home\n\nActivity: \"Space Explorer\"\n1. Stand in the middle of your open area\n2. Create your \"personal space bubble\" by extending your arms fully in all directions\n3. Make these specific shapes within your bubble:\n\n   - Tall shape: Reach up high with both arms\n   - Small shape: Crouch down with arms wrapped around knees\n   - Wide shape: Arms and legs stretched out like a star\n   - Twisted shape: Feet forward, upper body turned to one side\n4. Move through your general space using these movements:\n\n   - 10 careful walking steps\n   - 5 tip-toe steps\n   - 8 side steps\n5. After completing these movements, take a moment to think about:\n\n   - One time when you need personal space awareness at home (like moving around family members in the kitchen)\n   - One time when you need general space awareness outside (like navigating through a crowded hallway)\n\n**Troubleshooting**: If you bump into objects, make your movements smaller or rearrange your space. Success looks like completing all movements without collisions.\n\n## Directional Movements \nNow let's explore how we can move in different directions:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n**Forward/backward**: Moving toward/away from where you're facing\n\n**Sideways**: Moving to your right or left side\n\n**Up/down**: Moving toward the ceiling or floor\n\nActivity: \"Direction Detective\"\n1. Mark a starting point on the floor with a sock or piece of paper\n2. Complete this exact movement sequence:\n\n   - 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward\n   - 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left\n   - Reach up high 3 times, crouch down low 3 times\n3. Create your own sequence with 6-8 movements and write it down\n4. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row\n5. Self-check: Did you maintain control throughout all movements? Could you repeat your sequence exactly the same way multiple times?\n\n**Example sequence**: 2 steps forward, 1 step left, reach up twice, 3 steps backward, crouch down, 2 steps right\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n## Levels of Movement \n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nAs we continue our exploration, let's look at the three main levels of movement:\n\n**High level**: Movements that reach toward the ceiling (jumping, reaching up)\n\n**Medium level**: Movements at waist or chest height (walking, arm circles)\n\n**Low level**: Movements close to the floor (crawling, crouching)\n\nActivity: \"Level Shifters\"\n1. Make three signs labeled \"high,\" \"medium,\" and \"low\" and place them where you can see them\n2. Set your timer for 20 seconds\n3. Move freely during the countdown\n4. When the timer beeps, look at one of your level cards (your choice)\n5. Create and hold a movement or shape at that level for 5 seconds\n6. Repeat this process 6 times, trying to use each level at least twice\n7. After completing all rounds, take a moment to think about:\n\n   - One sport that uses high level movements (example: volleyball - jumping to spike)\n   - One sport that uses medium level movements (example: basketball - dribbling)\n   - One sport that uses low level movements (example: bowling - lunging low)\n\n**Adaptation for limited space**: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements.\n\n## Body Shapes (10-15 minutes)\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%% let's discover the four basic body shapes that form the foundation of many movements:\n\n**Wide**: Stretching out to take up more space (star jump)\n\n**Narrow**: Making yourself thin or skinny (pencil position)\n\n**Curved**: Creating rounded shapes with your body (ball shape)\n\n**Twisted**: Rotating parts of your body in different directions (twist at waist)\n\nActivity: \"Shape Shifter\"\n1. Practice each shape individually, holding for 5 seconds:\n\n   - Wide: Stand with legs apart and arms stretched out to sides\n   - Narrow: Stand tall with feet together, arms straight at sides\n   - Curved: Make a C-shape with your body, either standing or on the floor\n   - Twisted: Keep hips facing forward, turn upper body to right or left\n2. Set your timer for 15 seconds\n3. Move freely until the timer beeps, then freeze in one of the shapes\n4. Repeat 8 times, trying each shape at least twice\n5. Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together\n6. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row\n7. Draw your three-shape sequence on paper or describe it in writing\n\n**Success criteria**: You should be able to clearly demonstrate each shape with proper form and hold it steady for at least 5 seconds.\n\n## Putting It All Together: Spatial Awareness Challenge (10-15 minutes)\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\nNow that we've practiced each concept separately, let's combine everything you've learned:\n\n1. Create a movement card set by writing these 8 challenges on separate pieces of paper:\n\n   - \"Make a wide shape at a high level\"\n   - \"Move backward at a low level\"\n   - \"Create a twisted shape in your personal space\"\n   - \"Travel sideways through general space at a medium level\"\n   - \"Make a narrow shape while moving forward\"\n   - \"Create a curved shape at a low level\"\n   - \"Move in a high level with a twisted shape\"\n   - \"Travel in a zigzag pattern at medium level\"\n\n2. Shuffle the cards and place them face down\n3. Draw one card at a time and perform the movement\n4. After each movement, rate yourself:\n\n   - Green: I did this movement correctly and confidently\n   - Yellow: I did this movement but need more practice\n   - Red: I found this movement difficult\n\n5. Choose one \"yellow\" movement to practice 3 more times until it improves\n\n**Adaptation**: If any movements are too difficult, modify them to match your ability level. For example, if balance is challenging, you can hold onto a chair for support.\n\n## Self-Assessment and Reflection\nTake a few minutes to think about what you've learned. Complete these statements in your mind or write them down:\n\n1. I can identify personal space by _______________.\n2. I can identify general space by _______________.\n3. The three levels of movement are _______________.\n4. The four basic body shapes are _______________.\n5. One movement I performed well was _______________.\n6. One movement I want to improve is _______________.\n7. I could use spatial awareness in my daily life when _______________.\n8. These skills connect to (sport/activity) by _______________.\n\n## Progress Milestones\nYou've successfully completed this lesson when you can:\n\n- Clearly demonstrate all four body shapes\n- Move confidently at all three levels\n- Follow a sequence of directional movements without errors\n- Distinguish between personal and general space in practice\n- Create and perform your own movement sequence combining at least three concepts\n\n## Extensions and Adaptations\n\n- For extra challenge: Create a 30-second routine that includes at least one example of each concept (space, direction, level, and shape)\n- For support: Practice one concept at a time until comfortable before combining them\n- Connection to other subjects: These directions relate to math (coordinate planes) or dance (choreography)\n- Technology option: Record a video of your movements for self-assessment, watching it to identify areas for improvement\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Challenges\n\n- **Limited space**: Focus on stationary movements and smaller steps\n- **Balance difficulties**: Keep one hand near a wall or sturdy furniture for support\n- **Tracking progress**: Use a simple chart to mark off completed activities\n- **Remembering movements**: Write down or draw your sequences before performing them\n- **Physical limitations**: Adapt movements to your ability level - seated versions work for most activities\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your body moves through both personal space (the bubble around you) and general space (the area you travel through), which helps you move safely without collisions in physical activities.\n- Movement can happen at three different levels (high, medium, low) and in four basic body shapes (wide, narrow, curved, twisted) that form the building blocks for sports and dance.\n- Directional awareness (forward/backward, sideways, up/down) allows you to follow and create movement sequences that improve coordination and spatial intelligence.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content covers fundamental concepts of body awareness and spatial understanding in physical education. It introduces key ideas like personal vs. general space, levels of movement, basic body shapes, and directional movements. The content is structured around a series of interactive activities and reflective checkpoints to help learners actively engage with and apply the concepts.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt indicates that this is a markdown document containing embedded content generation instructions, marked with the delimiters `%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%%` and `%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%`. The task is to analyze each valid instruction block, generate content that fulfills the specified requirements, and replace only the instruction block (not the surrounding text) with the new content.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) enrolled in an online physical education course at Excel Middle School. Key considerations for this learner profile include:\n\n- Reading level at 5th-6th grade on the Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Varying prior exposure to physical education concepts\n- Preference for visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities\n- Limited access to specialized equipment and varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday language, active voice, and clear step-by-step instructions. Visuals like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations are important to support understanding. Adaptations for small spaces and common household items should be provided.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is intended for asynchronous online delivery, with no peer interaction. The format should be optimized for self-paced learning, with ample white space, frequent headings/subheadings, and clear organizational structures. Formatting best practices like bolding key terms, using call-out boxes, and providing printable tracking sheets will enhance the learner experience.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content\n- Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompts\n- Preserve the original content's value and flow, integrating new material seamlessly\n- Adapt language, examples, and complexity to match the target learner profile\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online learning medium\n\n## Suggested Approach\nWhen processing each content generation instruction block:\n\n1. Thoroughly analyze the requested specifications to understand the intended purpose and scope.\n2. Generate content that precisely fulfills these requirements, matching the tone, style, and technical depth of the surrounding text.\n3. Replace only the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content, ensuring a cohesive, natural flow.\n4. Leverage the learner profile details to guide appropriate language, visuals, and instructional design.\n5. Preserve all special marker tags (e.g. `---stopandreflect---`) intact, as they serve important pedagogical functions.\n6. If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose.\n\nThe final enhanced content should appear as a seamless, polished educational resource tailored to the target middle school audience."
