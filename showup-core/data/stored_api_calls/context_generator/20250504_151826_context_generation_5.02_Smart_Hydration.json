Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

When you run, jump, or play sports, having enough water becomes super important. Let's learn why water matters, how to tell if you need more, and easy ways to drink enough throughout your day.\n\n## Why Water Matters\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- **Cooling System**: When you sweat during basketball practice or recess, water helps lower your body temperature.\n- **Delivery Service**: Water moves vitamins and oxygen through your bloodstream to your muscles and organs.\n- **Cleanup Crew**: Water helps your kidneys filter out waste that your body doesn't need.\n- **Joint Protector**: The fluid in your joints contains water that helps you move without pain.\n- **Brain Booster**: Without enough water, you might find it hard to pay attention in math class or remember your science facts.\n\nIf you don't drink enough water, these body functions slow down. This especially matters when you're running around at PE or playing at recess.\n\n## Signs of Dehydration\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- **Feeling thirsty**: This basic signal means you should grab a drink soon.\n- **Dry, sticky mouth**: When your tongue feels like sandpaper, you need water.\n- **Headaches**: That pounding in your head might go away after drinking a glass of water.\n- **Feeling tired or dizzy**: Not enough water can make even walking to class feel exhausting.\n- **Dark yellow urine**: Check after you use the bathroom - pale yellow means you're drinking enough, while dark yellow or amber means drink up!\n\nIf you notice these signs, your body is asking for water. Remember, by the time you feel thirsty, you're already slightly dehydrated, so it's best to drink water regularly throughout the day.\n\n## How Much Water Do You Need?\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Most kids your age (11-14) need about 7-9 cups of water daily.\n- Playing soccer or spending time outside on hot days means you'll need extra.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n<br/>\nFor sports and activities:\n\n- **Before**: Drink 1-2 cups of water 1-2 hours before you start moving.\n- **During**: Take quick water breaks every 15-20 minutes while you're active.\n- **After**: Drink 2-3 cups when you finish to replace what you lost in sweat.\n\n## Hydration Tips\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph OR TWO so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- **Carry a cool water bottle**: Pick a bottle you like - maybe one with your favorite color or sports team logo.\n- **Set water goals**: Try to empty your water bottle before lunch, then fill it up again for the afternoon.\n- **Eat your water**: Bite into a juicy watermelon slice or munch on cucumber sticks - they're packed with water.\n- **Add flavor to your water**: Toss in some strawberry slices or lemon wedges to make water taste better.\n- **Use technology**: Some phones have free apps that remind you when it's time to take a drink.\n- **Create a routine**: Drink water when you first wake up, before you eat meals, and before bedtime.\n\n\n1. **Hydration Tracking Activity**\n   \n   **What you'll need:**\n- A water bottle (any size works - just know how many cups it holds)\n- Paper and pencil or the tracking sheet below\n- A clock or timer\n   \n   **Step-by-step instructions:**\n   1. Write down how many cups of water your bottle holds\n   2. Each time you finish your bottle, mark it on your tracking sheet\n   3. At the end of the day, add up your total cups\n   4. Compare your total to the recommended 7-9 cups\n   \n   **Success check:** If you reached 7-9 cups, great job! If not, try to add one more refill tomorrow.\n   \n   **Troubleshooting:** Forgetting to track? Put your tracking sheet next to where you usually eat or do homework. Or set an alarm on a clock or phone to remind you to drink and track every 2 hours.\n   \n   **Sample tracking sheet:**\n   ```\n   My Water Bottle = ___ cups\n   \n<br/>\n   Monday:   □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □  Total: ___\n   Tuesday:  □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □  Total: ___\n   Wednesday: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □  Total: ___\n   Thursday: □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □  Total: ___\n   Friday:   □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □  Total: ___\n\n   **What you'll need:**\n- Yellow colored pencils, markers, or crayons (light, medium, and dark yellow)\n- Small piece of paper\n   \n   **Step-by-step instructions:**\n   1. Draw three circles on your paper\n   2. Color the first circle pale yellow (like lemonade)\n   3. Color the second circle medium yellow (like apple juice)\n   4. Color the third circle dark yellow/amber (like orange juice)\n   5. Label them: \"Well hydrated,\" \"Drink water soon,\" and \"Drink water now!\"\n   6. Tape this chart inside your bathroom cabinet\n   7. For one week, compare your urine color to the chart\n   \n   **Success check:** By the end of the week, you should see mostly pale yellow results if you're drinking enough water.\n   \n   **Troubleshooting:** If your chart gets wet or damaged, just make a new one. Remember that some vitamins or foods can change urine color, so don't worry if it looks unusual after taking vitamins.\n   \n   **Note:** This is for your personal health tracking only - you don't need to share these results with anyone.\n\n3. **Water Bottle Challenge**\n\n- A small reward you choose for yourself (like 15 minutes of extra reading or game time)\n   \n   **Step-by-step instructions:**\n   1. Decide how many bottles you need to drink each day (usually 2-3 depending on your bottle size)\n   2. Write this goal at the top of your chart\n   3. Each day, color in or check off each bottle as you finish it\n   4. At the end of the week, count how many days you met your goal\n   5. If you met your goal at least 5 days, give yourself the reward you chose\n   \n   **Success check:** You should notice changes like fewer headaches, more energy, and lighter colored urine when you meet your water goals.\n   \n   **Troubleshooting:** If you keep forgetting your water bottle, try putting it by the door you use to leave your room or house. If you don't like plain water, try adding fruit slices or a splash of juice.\n   \n   **Sample chart:**\n   \n   My daily goal: ___ bottles (equals ___ cups)\n   \n<br/>\n   Monday:    □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   Tuesday:   □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   Wednesday: □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   Thursday:  □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   Friday:    □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   Saturday:  □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   Sunday:    □ □ □ □  Goal met? Yes/No\n   \n<br/>\n   Days I met my goal: ___/7\n   Changes I noticed: ________________\n   ```\n\nNow that you understand the importance of hydration, you can see how water keeps your body working properly. When you drink enough, you'll have more energy for activities, better focus during homework time, and fewer headaches throughout the day. Remember to sip water regularly, especially during physical activities or on sunny days. Your body works better when it has all the water it needs.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Water is essential for your body's cooling system, delivery of nutrients, waste removal, joint protection, and brain function - without enough water, these systems don't work properly.\n- Your body shows clear signs when you need more water, including thirst, headaches, tiredness, and dark yellow urine - aim for 7-9 cups daily and more when you're active.\n- Creating a personal hydration routine with a water bottle, tracking system, and regular drinking habits helps you stay properly hydrated throughout the day.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
