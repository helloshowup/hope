Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nConvert the following JSON data into a clean, structured markdown format by transforming each entry into a header section with the term as an H2 heading (preceded by ##).

  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a glossary of 22 key robotics programming terms adapted for a middle school audience (grades 5-6). Each entry provides a clear definition, relatable example, and suggested visual recommendation to help illustrate the concept. The terms are organized alphabetically and formatted in JSON, making the content easy to integrate into educational materials or reference guides.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe prompt requests that the JSON data be converted into a clean, structured markdown format. Specifically:\n\n1. Transform each entry into a header section with the term as an H2 heading (##).\n2. Sort all entries alphabetically by term and remove any duplicate entries.\n3. For each entry, display the definition, example, and pronunciation (when available) on separate lines with appropriate bolding. \n4. Include the pronunciation in quotes if present, otherwise omit that field entirely.\n5. Format the definition and example with \"Definition:\" and \"Example:\" as bold prefixes followed by two spaces before their content.\n6. Ignore the \"visual_recommendation\" and \"difficulty_level\" fields completely.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) enrolled in an online Foundations of Robotics course. Key considerations:\n\n- Reading level should be at 5th-6th grade on the Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds, avoiding jargon\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words and write in active voice/present tense\n- Break content into clear \"chunks\" with frequent headings and visual elements\n- Connect technical concepts to real-world examples relevant to middle schoolers\n- Maintain a conversational, friendly tone to engage the audience\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no opportunities for peer interaction. This means the formatting and structure must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without instructor guidance.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core educational value of the glossary by maintaining clear definitions and relatable examples\n- Enhance the content's visual appeal and readability through appropriate formatting\n- Ensure the final product aligns with the target learner's needs and learning environment\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Sort the terms alphabetically and remove any duplicates to create a clean, organized structure.\n2. Transform each entry into a header section with the term as an H2 heading (##).\n3. For each entry, display the definition and example on separate lines with appropriate bolding.\n4. Include the pronunciation in quotes if available, otherwise omit that field.\n5. Format the definition and example using bold prefixes (\"**Definition:**\" and \"**Example:**\") followed by two spaces before the content.\n6. Omit the \"visual_recommendation\" and \"difficulty_level\" fields as requested.\n7. Ensure the final content is visually engaging, easy to scan, and tailored to the target learner's needs and learning environment."
