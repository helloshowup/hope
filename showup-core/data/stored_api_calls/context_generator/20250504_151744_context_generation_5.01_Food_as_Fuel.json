Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n- You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n- Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n- Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n- Activity: Stand up and do 10 jumping jacks. Take a moment to notice how your breathing changes. Your body just used carbohydrates to power that movement.\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n- Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n- Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n- This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n- Activity: Gently squeeze your arm muscle. The firmness you feel is made of protein that helps your body move.\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n- Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n- Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n- Your brain needs fats to work well\n- We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein, but they're still important for health\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert an \"Audio Instructions\" section within the markers ---audioinstructions--- and ---audioinstructionsEND---. Create this based on the content that follows this instruction block. The section should include a heading \"### Audio Instructions: \" followed by a brief title that describes the key action or concept being explained (e.g., \"How to Skip\" should be replaced with an appropriate title based on the following content). Then include a URL in this format: https://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/X-X-Y.mp3 where X-X should match the lesson number found at the top of the document (e.g., \"2.1\" would become \"2-1\"), and Y should be a sequential number starting with 1 for the first audio instruction in the file, 2 for the second, etc. Place this section at the appropriate point in the content where audio guidance would be most helpful.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items\n2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings\n4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in\n3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle\n4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)\n5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:\n\n- Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)\n- An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database\n- A food guide chart (included below)\n\n### Example of Completed Activity:\n\n- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana\n- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt\n- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.\n- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.\n- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  - 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  - 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  - After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  - 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  - 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  - 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  - Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  - Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  - Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  - Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  - Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Knowledge Check and Application Activities\n\n### My Performance Plate Activity:\n1. Materials needed: Paper, pencil, and coloring supplies (optional)\n2. Draw a circle to represent a plate\n3. Divide your plate according to the \"Perfect Plate\" guidelines above\n4. In each section, draw or write specific foods you would eat:\n\n- Before your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"Before\")\n- After your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"After\")\n5. For each plate, write why you chose those specific foods\n6. Success criteria: Your \"Before\" plate should include quick energy foods (mainly carbs), while your \"After\" plate should include recovery foods (protein and carbs)\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your body needs three main nutrients for physical activity: carbohydrates for quick energy, proteins for muscle building and repair, and fats for long-lasting energy.\n- Timing your meals matters for performance - eat larger balanced meals 2-3 hours before activity, quick carbs 30-60 minutes before, and protein with carbs after exercise for recovery.\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" for active bodies includes half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains, one-quarter protein foods, and a small amount of healthy fats.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the three main nutrients that power the body for physical activity: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It explains the role of each nutrient and includes hands-on activities to help learners categorize different foods into these nutrient groups. The content also covers the importance of timing meals and snacks around physical activity for optimal performance and recovery.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks you to:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nThe prompt also specifies that you must preserve all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, ---keytakeaways---) exactly as they appear in the document.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learner profile indicates that this content is for a physical education course targeting middle school students (ages 11-14) in an asynchronous online learning environment. Key considerations include:\n\n- Reading level: 5th-6th grade\n- Language: Simple, conversational English with limited jargon\n- Learning style: Visual demonstrations, hands-on activities, real-world examples\n- Equipment/space: Adaptations for limited access to specialized equipment and varying home environments\n\nWhen enhancing the content, ensure the language, examples, and complexity are appropriate for this target audience. Maintain a friendly, engaging tone and break information into clear, manageable chunks.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online learning platform, with no opportunity for peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained and provide all necessary instructions and support for the learner to complete the activities independently.\n\nConsider incorporating more visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations to compensate for the lack of in-person guidance. Ensure clear, step-by-step instructions are provided for any hands-on activities.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core educational value and learning objectives of the original content\n- Enhance the content to be more engaging, relatable, and accessible for the target middle school audience\n- Integrate new content seamlessly with the existing text, maintaining a consistent tone and style\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery, providing all necessary support and guidance\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Thoroughly review the current content, learning objectives, and target learner profile to understand the core purpose and structure of the material.\n2. Analyze each instruction block in the document, identifying the specific content requirements and any formatting or integration needs.\n3. Generate new content that precisely fulfills the requested specifications while adapting the language, examples, and complexity to the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school learner characteristics.\n4. Ensure the new content aligns with the established tone, style, and pedagogical approach of the original material.\n5. Incorporate more visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations to support the asynchronous online delivery.\n6. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for any hands-on activities to enable independent learning.\n7. Carefully integrate the new content into the existing text, maintaining logical flow and preserving all special marker tags.\n\nThe enhanced content should read as a cohesive, engaging learning experience tailored to the needs of the target middle school audience in an asynchronous online environment."
