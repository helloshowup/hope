Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

These records help you make better exercise choices and build lasting healthy habits. The self-monitoring skills you develop won't just improve your fitnessâ€”they'll be useful in many other parts of your life too.\n\nYou'll need:\n- A cardio log worksheet (printable version available in your course materials)\n- A pencil or pen\n- A timer or stopwatch (or a phone with a timer app)\n- Comfortable clothes for movement\n\n## Let's Begin!\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Your Cardio Log \nYour cardio log helps you keep track of your exercise sessions. In it, you'll write down:\n- The cardio activity you did (jumping jacks, running in place, etc.)\n- How long you exercised (minutes)\n- How difficult it felt (scale: 1=easy to 5=very challenging)\n- How you felt during and after (energized, tired, happy, etc.)\n\nTake a moment to look at your cardio log worksheet. Find each section where you'll record this information. Check the example in your materials to see what a completed entry looks like.\n\n### Step 2: Get Moving! \nNow it's time to try some cardio! Here are some exercises you can do at home:\n\n- Jumping jacks: Stand with feet together, then jump while spreading your legs and raising your arms overhead.\n- High knees: Run in place while lifting your knees up high toward your chest.\n- Butt kicks: Jog in place while kicking your heels toward your bottom.\n- Mountain climbers: Get in push-up position, then bring your knees to your chest one at a time.\n\nChoose 3-4 exercises and do each for 1-2 minutes. Rest for 30 seconds between exercises if needed. Pay attention to how your body respondsâ€”notice your heartbeat, breathing, and which muscles you feel working. Some activities might feel easier or harder for you than others.\n\n### Step 3: Record Your Activity\nFill out your cardio log right after you finish exercising. Be honest about how the workout feltâ€”this record is for you to learn about yourself, not to impress anyone else!\n\n### Step 4: Reflect on Your Experience\nThink about your workout experience and answer these questions in your notebook:\n- Which activities did you enjoy most? Why?\n- Which activities felt the most challenging?\n- How did your body feel during different parts of the workout?\n- How do you feel now, after completing the workout?\n- What might you do differently next time?\n\n### Step 5: Set a Personal Cardio Goal \nNow that you've tried some cardio activities, create one specific fitness goal for yourself. A good goal follows the SMART format:\n\n- Specific: Exactly what you want to accomplish\n- Measurable: How you'll know if you've reached it\n- Achievable: Something you can realistically do\n- Relevant: Important to you personally\n- Time-bound: When you plan to achieve it\n\nFor example: \"I will do 10 minutes of jumping jacks and high knees three times a week for the next two weeks.\"\n\nWrite your goal in your cardio log. If possible, share your goal with a family memberâ€”telling someone else about it helps you stick with it.\n\n## Wrap-Up\nToday you learned how to track and reflect on your cardio activities. Your cardio log will help you spot patterns, set effective goals, and adjust your routine to improve your fitness. This self-monitoring approach helps build exercise habits that last.\n\nAs we continue our fitness journey, we'll explore different muscle groups and how they work together during exercise. The cardio tracking skills you're developing now will connect with our upcoming focus on strength and flexibility.\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Tracking your cardio workouts helps you identify patterns and make better exercise choices that lead to lasting healthy habits.\n- Creating SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) gives your fitness journey clear direction and increases your chances of success.\n- Paying attention to how your body feels during and after exercise provides valuable feedback to guide your future workout decisions.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
