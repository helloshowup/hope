Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

This guide shows you how your heart functions, what changes during exercise, and why regular physical activity keeps you healthy now and in the future. Learning these fundamentals helps you make smarter health choices as you grow.\n\n## How the Heart Works\nYour heart sits slightly left of center in your chest, a powerful muscle about the same size as your closed fist. Inside this remarkable organ, four chambers work together to move blood throughout your entire body.\n\n<br/>\nYour heart divides into two sides with two chambers each:\n\n- The right side collects blood from your body and sends it to your lungs for oxygen\n- The left side receives oxygen-filled blood from your lungs and pushes it out to feed your cells\n\nThat rhythmic thump you feel when placing your hand on your chest comes from your heart muscle contracting. Most people's hearts beat between 60-100 times each minute while resting, though this changes based on activity.\n\n## The Heart During Exercise\nWhen you start running, swimming, or playing basketball, your muscles suddenly need more oxygen. Your heart immediately responds by pumping faster and harder to deliver extra blood to those working muscles.\n\n<br/>\nDuring activity, your heart might beat 150 times per minute or even more. This increased workload actually benefits your heart. Just like practicing basketball improves your shooting skills, this extra work strengthens your heart muscle over time.\n\n<br/>\nThe most fascinating part? As your heart grows stronger through consistent exercise, it becomes more efficient. A well-conditioned heart pumps more blood with each beat, allowing it to work less during normal activities. This explains why physically active people often have slower resting heart rates.\n\n## Benefits of Cardiovascular Exercise\nMoving your body regularly in ways that raise your heart rate creates many health improvements:\n\n<br/>\nYour heart becomes a stronger muscle. When you work out often, your heart pumps more effectively.\n\n<br/>\nYou'll have more energy for daily activities. With a better-working heart and lungs, you can play sports longer, participate in school activities, and enjoy time with friends without getting tired quickly.\n\n<br/>\nPhysical activity helps you sleep better by helping you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly through the night.\n\n<br/>\nExercise improves your mood by releasing endorphins—natural chemicals that make you feel happier and less stressed.\n\n<br/>\nCardio helps maintain a healthy body weight by burning calories during and after your workout.\n\n<br/>\nYour brain works better with exercise too! Increased blood flow to your brain can help you focus better in class and remember information.\n\n<br/>\nRegular activity strengthens your immune system, helping your body fight off colds and other illnesses more effectively.\n\n## Recommended Cardio Guidelines\nHealth experts suggest that 11-14 year olds should move actively for at least 60 minutes daily. Don't worry—this doesn't mean one long workout. Short bursts of activity throughout the day add up!\n\n<br/>\nTry these cardio activities you can do independently:\n\n- Dancing while playing your favorite songs\n- Biking around your neighborhood\n- Swimming laps or playing in the pool\n- Shooting hoops in your driveway\n- Walking your dog around the block\n- Jumping rope in your yard\n- Playing motion-based video games\n\nThe secret to staying active? Find activities you actually enjoy, so moving your body feels like something you want to do, not something you have to do.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about your favorite physical activities - do you notice how your breathing and heart rate change when you're having fun and moving around?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n## Heart Rate Exploration\n\n---audioinstructions---\n#### Audio Instructions: Measuring Your Heart Rate During Exercise\nhttps://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/3-1-1.mp3\n\n---audioinstructionsEND---\n\nDiscover how exercise affects your own heart with this simple activity:\n\n**What you'll need:** A timer that shows seconds (your phone works perfectly)\n\n**Step 1:** Find your pulse by pressing two fingers (not your thumb) against your wrist or neck. Count the beats for 15 seconds, then multiply by 4. This number represents your resting heart rate.\n\n**Step 2:** Do jumping jacks or jog in place for about a minute (or as long as comfortable).\n\n**Step 3:** Immediately check your pulse again using the same method. Notice the increase in your heart rate.\n\n**Step 4:** Rest for a few minutes, then check your pulse once more. Watch how your heart rate gradually returns to normal.\n\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities. ask them about - What caused your heart rate to climb during exercise?\n- How might your heart respond differently after several weeks of regular exercise?\n- Which activities make your heart beat fastest?\n] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n<br/>\nYour heart works continuously—even during sleep. By understanding this incredible muscle and exercising it regularly, you're building a foundation for lifelong health. When you discover physical activities you truly enjoy, heart-healthy habits become part of who you are. Your reward? More energy each day, better moods, and a body that serves you well for years to come.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout your body, beating faster during exercise to deliver more oxygen to working muscles.\n- Regular cardiovascular exercise strengthens your heart, giving you more energy, better sleep, improved mood, and helping fight illness.\n- Health experts recommend 60 minutes of daily physical activity for 11-14 year olds, which can be broken into shorter sessions of activities you enjoy.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
