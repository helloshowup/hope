Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Fill out your tracking chart to see which ones work best for different situations.\n\n**Remember:** Just like learning to ride a bike or play a video game, these skills get better with practice!\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your breathing directly connects to how you feel, and you can use different breathing techniques (Belly, Box, and Cooling) to calm down, focus, or cool off in different situations.\n- Body awareness exercises like Body Scans and Muscle Relaxation help you find and release tension, giving you more control over how your body responds to stress.\n- Regular practice and tracking of these techniques helps you discover which methods work best for you in different situations, making them more effective tools for self-control.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on breathing and body awareness techniques for self-control. It covers several specific breathing exercises (Belly Breathing, Box Breathing, Cooling Breath) as well as body awareness practices (Body Scan, Muscle Relaxation, Breathing with Movement) that can help learners manage stress, focus, and relax. The content includes step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, and guidance on when to use each technique.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n1. Ensure the content is appropriately adapted for the target middle school audience (ages 11-14)\n2. Optimize the delivery for asynchronous online learning with limited peer interaction\n3. Incorporate more visual elements, storytelling, and engagement strategies to keep learners motivated\n4. Provide clear alternatives and modifications for activities based on available home equipment and space\n5. Emphasize safety considerations and offer variations for different physical abilities\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Reading level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: English, with familiar everyday words\n- Prior knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts\n- Learning style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical space/equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no opportunities for peer interaction. This means the material must be self-contained, with all necessary instructions and support provided within the text and visuals. Formatting and structure should be optimized for easy navigation and comprehension on a digital device.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to match the 11-14 year old target audience\n- Incorporate more visual elements, storytelling, and engagement strategies to sustain learner interest\n- Provide clear alternatives and modifications for activities based on available home equipment and space\n- Emphasize safety considerations and offer variations for different physical abilities\n\n## Suggested Approach\nWhen enhancing this content, focus on the following:\n\n1. Simplify the language and sentence structure to a 5th-6th grade reading level, using familiar everyday words.\n2. Break up the content into shorter, more visually engaging \"chunks\" with frequent headings, subheadings, and bullet points.\n3. Include relevant images, diagrams, and illustrations to support each new exercise or activity.\n4. Incorporate more storytelling elements and real-world connections to make the content relatable for middle school learners.\n5. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for each technique, with \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information.\n6. Offer alternative versions of activities using common household items, and suggest adaptations for small spaces or different physical abilities.\n7. Emphasize safety considerations, proper form, and gradual progression to prevent injury or discomfort.\n8. Use a friendly, conversational tone to engage the learners directly (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\").\n9. Create printable tracking sheets and reflection questions to help learners monitor their progress and discover which techniques work best for them.\n\nThe enhanced content should maintain the educational value of the original while being more accessible, engaging, and tailored to the needs of the 11-14 year old target audience in an asynchronous online learning environment."
