Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

These are things like walking, running, hopping, jumping, and skipping. They might seem simple, but they're actually the core skills behind every sport, dance, or playground game you know.\n\nGetting really good at these helps you move with more control, feel more confident in your body, and be ready for anything from football to freeze tag.\n\nThink about how you move during a game of tag or football. Ever noticed how you switch between different movements? That's what we're exploring today - those fundamental ways we move our bodies from place to place. These basic movements are the building blocks that make all sports and physical activities possible.\n\n## Locomotor Movement Demonstrations (10 minutes)\nLet's explore five basic locomotor movements. Watch closely as I demonstrate each one:\n\n1. **Walking**: Walking might seem super easy, but there's actually a right way to do it! \n\n**How to walk with good technique:**\n   * Stand tall with your head up and shoulders relaxed\n   * Start by placing your heel on the ground first, then roll to your toes (heel-to-toe)\n   * Keep your arms bent at about 90 degrees, swinging them naturally opposite to your legs\n   * Take steps that feel comfortable - not too big or too small\n   * Look ahead, not down at your feet\n   \nTry walking across the room focusing on your posture. Notice how different it feels when you pay attention to your walking technique.\n\n2. **Running**: Running builds on walking but adds more speed and power. Good running technique helps you move faster while using less energy!\n\n   **How to run with good technique:**\n   * Keep your upper body straight but slightly leaned forward\n   * Lift your knees higher than when walking\n   * Land on the middle or front part of your foot, not your heel\n   * Bend your arms at about 90 degrees and pump them forward and back (not side to side)\n   * Keep your hands relaxed - imagine holding a potato chip without crushing it\n   * Breathe naturally through both your nose and mouth\n\nWhen you run with good form, you'll be able to run longer distances without getting as tired.\n\n3. **Hopping**: Hopping is jumping and landing on the same foot. It's a great way to build strength and balance in each leg separately.\n\n   **How to hop correctly:**\n   * Start standing on one foot with your knee slightly bent\n   * Swing your arms forward as you push off the ground\n   * Keep your eyes focused on one spot to help with balance\n   * Land softly on the ball of the same foot you jumped from, bending your knee to absorb the impact\n   * Use your arms to help keep your balance\n   * Practice on both your right and left foot - most people find one side easier than the other!\n\nTry hopping in place 5 times on each foot. Which foot feels more comfortable to hop on?\n\n4. **Jumping**: Jumping uses both feet together to push off and land. It's used in many sports like basketball, volleyball, and track and field.\n\n   **How to jump effectively:**\n   * Start with your feet shoulder-width apart\n   * Bend your knees and hips like you're sitting in a chair\n   * Swing your arms backward, then forward and upward as you jump\n   * Push off with both feet at the same time\n   * While in the air, keep your body straight and look forward\n   * Land softly on the balls of your feet with your knees bent to absorb the shock\n   * End with your arms forward for balance\n\n   Remember: the deeper you bend before jumping, the higher you can usually jump!\n\n5. **Skipping**: Skipping combines a step and a hop in a rhythmic pattern. It's fun and great for coordination!\n\n   **How to skip:**\n   * Step forward with one foot\n   * Hop on that same foot while lifting your other knee up\n   * Then step forward with the other foot and hop on it\n   * Continue this step-hop pattern, alternating feet\n   * Use your arms naturally - they should swing in opposition to your legs\n   * Try to create a steady rhythm: step-hop, step-hop\n   * Keep your head up and maintain good posture\n\nSkipping is used in many sports for warming up and improving coordination. It might take a little practice to get the rhythm right, but once you do, it's really fun!\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nThe locomotor movements we've practised today will serve you throughout your life. Whether you're playing netball, dancing, running track, or just having a kickabout with friends, these fundamental movements are valuable for staying active and healthy. Keep practising whenever you can, and you'll develop the confidence to try new physical activities and sports!\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content.
