Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;
