Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\n# Learning Objectives Generator for Middle School Content\n\nI need learning objectives inserted into the markdown content. Follow these precise requirements:\n\n## TASK OVERVIEW\nGenerate 1-3 learning objectives for 11-14 year old students (6th grade reading level) and insert them after the main title using the proper edit commands.\n\n## TARGET AUDIENCE REQUIREMENTS\nThe content is for middle school students (grades 6-8):\n- VOCABULARY SIMPLICITY IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY\n- Keep all words under 8 letters when possible\n- Use concrete rather than abstract language\n- Avoid multi-syllable academic terms\n- Explain concepts using familiar examples\n- Assume this might be the student's first exposure to the topic\n\n## INSERTION INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Identify the insertion point:\n   - After the main title/heading (typically H1 or H2)\n   - Before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section\n\n2. Format the objectives exactly like this:\n```\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- [First objective with simple verb]\n- [Second objective with simple verb]\n- [Third objective with simple verb]\n\n```\n\n3. Maintain proper spacing:\n   - One empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - One empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Do not disrupt existing paragraph breaks\n\n## LEARNING OBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS\n1. Maximum of 3 objectives per lesson\n2. Must be SMART:\n   - Specific: Clear, focused on one skill\n   - Measurable: Observable performance\n   - Achievable: Realistic for a 1-2 hour lesson\n   - Relevant: Directly tied to lesson content\n   - Time-bound: Accomplishable in one session\n\n3. Use these age-appropriate action verbs:\n   - **Simple Knowledge**: List, Name, Point to, Tell, Show\n   - **Basic Understanding**: Explain, Retell, Show how, Give examples\n   - **Application**: Use, Build, Make, Try, Show\n   - **Simple Analysis**: Sort, Group, Compare, Find reasons why\n   - **Creation**: Create, Make, Build, Put together\n   - **Choice-Making**: Pick the best, Rate, Choose, Decide\n\n## VOCABULARY SIMPLIFICATION RULES\n1. Replace any words over 8 letters with simpler alternatives\n2. Replace abstract concepts with concrete examples\n3. Eliminate academic jargon like \"differentiate,\" \"analyze,\" or \"evaluate\"\n4. Test each objective by asking: \"Would a 12-year-old understand every word?\"\n5. STRICTLY AVOID:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Academic terms (analyze, evaluate, differentiate, synthesize)\n   - Multiple skills in one objective\n   - Complex sentence structures with multiple clauses\n\n## RESPONSE FORMAT\nUse ONLY this edit command format:\n```\nINSERT AFTER LINE X:\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- [First simple objective]\n- [Second simple objective]\n- [Third simple objective]\n\n```\nWhere X is the line number after the title and before first content.\n\n## EXAMPLES OF PROPERLY SIMPLIFIED OBJECTIVES\n\n**Science Example**\nToo Academic: \"Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable energy sources.\"\nBetter: \"Sort energy types into two groups: ones that last forever and ones that run out.\"\n\n**Math Example**\nToo Academic: \"Apply proportional reasoning to solve problems.\"\nBetter: \"Use ratios to solve everyday math problems.\"\n\n**Language Arts Example**\nToo Academic: \"Analyze how word choice affects tone.\"\nBetter: \"Find words that make you feel happy, sad, or scared in a story.\"\n\n**History Example**\nToo Academic: \"Evaluate the impact of technological advancements.\"\nBetter: \"Show how new tools changed how people lived long ago.\"\n\n**Art Example**\nToo Academic: \"Demonstrate application of complementary colors.\"\nBetter: \"Show how to use colors that look good together.\"\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Unified Target Learner Profile  \n**Excel Education Systems (Grades 6–12)**\n\n## GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\n- **Age Range:** 11–18 years old, covering middle and high school grades (6–12).\n- **Enrollment Type:** Students are enrolled full- or part-time in an accredited, asynchronous online learning environment.\n- **Learning Format:** All courses are asynchronous and self-paced, requiring students to work independently and manage their own schedules.\n- **Geographic Reach:** Students are globally distributed, participating from diverse countries and time zones.\n- **Language:** Instruction is in English. Students are required to read, write, and communicate at a minimum of a 6th-grade level to succeed.\n- **Technology Access:** Students have varying levels of digital literacy and access to devices. Most use laptops or desktop computers with basic office software and reliable internet.\n\n## ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL BACKGROUNDS\n\n- **Academic Diversity:** Learners come from a wide range of educational experiences. Some are advanced and college-bound; others are catching up on credits or exploring alternative education pathways.\n- **Skill Levels:** Varying levels of prior knowledge, especially in middle school where formal instruction in certain subjects may be limited.\n- **Career and College Orientation:** High school students are often preparing for post-secondary education or career pathways. Some are enrolled in dual credit or honors tracks.\n- **Special Circumstances:** Many students enroll due to the need for flexibility—balancing academics with travel, work, family obligations, or social/emotional considerations.\n\n## LEARNING ENVIRONMENT & SUPPORT NEEDS\n\n- **Self-Management:** Success depends heavily on student motivation, time management, and initiative. Students need tools and strategies to stay on track without daily external supervision.\n- **Parental Involvement:** Particularly important for younger learners (grades 6–8), where parents often help set routines, provide motivation, and monitor progress.\n- **Physical Learning Space:** Students complete coursework from home or other informal settings. Space and equipment availability vary; content must accommodate these limitations.\n- **Support Systems:** Students benefit from access to academic coaching, tech support, and structured communication channels (Help Desk, progress tracking tools).\n\n## INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Readability:** Use plain language with short sentences. Aim for a 5th–6th grade reading level for younger students, with progressive complexity for high school learners.\n- **Clarity and Engagement:** Content must be engaging and broken into manageable chunks. Use explicit task directions, active verbs, and one clear objective per activity.\n- **Visual and Interactive Elements:** Favor diagrams, examples, videos, and interactive tools. Visual demonstrations and storytelling are particularly effective for middle schoolers.\n- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Content must reflect global awareness and avoid region-specific assumptions. Examples and references should be inclusive and widely understandable.\n- **Flexibility:** Design activities that can be completed with minimal materials and adaptable for small or shared spaces.\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 1.1 Understanding the Purpose of Orientation\n\nStarting your journey at Excel High School? You're in the right place. This orientation will help you navigate our online learning community, understand what makes Excel unique, and connect with resources designed to support your success throughout high school.\n\n## What is Student Orientation?\nStudent orientation is your roadmap to success at Excel High School. Think of it as your personal tour guide that introduces you to everything you need to know about your new school. Just like you might get a tour on your first day at a physical school building, our online orientation helps you find your way around our digital campus.\n\nThis orientation isn't just about learning where things are—it's about helping you feel at home in our learning community. We've designed each part of this experience based on what thousands of successful online students before you have needed to know when starting their Excel journey.\n\nDuring orientation, you'll:\n\n- Get comfortable with our digital learning platform\n- Learn about Excel's expectations and how we support your learning\n- Discover resources available to you as an Excel student\n- Connect with classmates and begin building your online community\n\n**Real-World Connection:** Remember when you started something new—perhaps a sport, club, or job—and someone showed you around? That initial guidance probably helped you feel more confident. That's exactly what orientation does for your high school experience!\n\n## Excel's Mission, Vision, and Values\nExcel High School is part of Excel Education Systems, a family of schools committed to providing quality education in flexible formats. Our mission is to empower students like you to achieve academic success while developing the skills needed for college, career, and life.\n\nOur vision is to be a leader in innovative, personalised learning that meets students where they are and helps them get where they want to go.\n\nAt Excel, we live by these core values:\n\n1. **Student Success** - Your achievement is our priority\n2. **Academic Excellence** - We maintain high standards while providing the support you need\n3. **Flexibility** - We design learning experiences that fit your life and learning style\n4. **Innovation** - We continuously improve our programmes using the latest educational research\n5. **Community** - We foster connection even in an online environment\n\nThese values shape every aspect of your experience here.
