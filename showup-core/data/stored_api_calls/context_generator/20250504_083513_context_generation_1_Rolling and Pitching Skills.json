These pitching and rolling skills might seem simple, but they're the building blocks for loads of sports - from bowling and softball to cricket and target games. Plus, they'll seriously boost your coordination!\n\n## Materials\n- Rolled-up socks\n- Small, soft balls (tennis balls, rubber balls)\n- Bean bags or small stuffed animals\n- Paper balls\n- Household items for targets (empty water bottles, cardboard boxes, paper plates)\n\n## Warm-Up \nLet's get those muscles ready:\n- Jog in place until you feel warm\n- 10 arm circles forward and backward\n- 10 jumping jacks\n- High knees for as long as comfortable\n- Side-to-side hops until you feel ready\n\n## Rolling Technique\nHere's how to nail your rolling technique:\n\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent\n2. Hold your object (sock ball, soft ball) with both hands\n3. Focus your eyes on your target\n4. Swing the object back between your legs\n5. Shift your weight to your back foot\n6. Swing forward, releasing the object close to the ground\n7. Follow through with your swing while keeping your eyes on the target\n\nTry this technique with different objects. Which ones roll best? Do heavier objects roll straighter? Make notes about what you discover.\n\n## Underhand Pitching Technique\nNow for pitching - a bit trickier but super useful:\n\n1. Stand with your stronger foot slightly forward\n2. Hold the object in your stronger hand\n3. Keep your eyes locked on your target\n4. Swing your arm back\n5. Step forward with your opposite foot as you swing your arm forward\n6. Release the object with a smooth motion\n7. Follow through with your arm pointing toward the target\n\nExperiment with different objects. Notice how your grip changes how the object flies? Try adjusting your grip and see what happens.\n\n## Skill Practise Activities\n\n### Target Challenge\n- Set up targets (bottles, boxes) at different distances around your space\n- Start close and gradually back up as you improve\n- Give yourself points for hitting targets (harder targets = more points)\n- Try both rolling and pitching - which gives you better aim?\n- Keep track of your score and try to beat it each round\n\n### Accuracy Game\n- Place targets on the floor (paper plates work brilliantly)\n- Try landing your object on these targets\n- Challenge: Can you make your object stop exactly on target without rolling away?\n- Create a scoring system for yourself based on how close you get to the center\n\n### Knock-Down Challenge\n- Stack empty plastic bottles or toilet paper rolls in a pyramid\n- See how many you can knock down with one roll or pitch\n- Rebuild and try again from different angles and distances\n- Count how many attempts it takes to knock them all down\n\n## Cool-Down and Over to You (5-7 minutes)\nWhile you stretch your arms, shoulders, and legs, think about:\n- Which technique felt more natural to you and why?\n- What objects worked best for your throwing style?\n- How did you adjust when you missed your target?\n- Where might you use these skills outside of PE?\n\n## Assessment\nAs you practice these skills, check yourself on:\n- Your rolling and pitching form - are you following all the steps?\n- How well you control direction and speed - are your throws consistent?\n- Your accuracy when aiming at targets - are you improving with practice?\n- How you solve problems when something isn't working - what adjustments help?\n\n## Home Practise Ideas\n- Create a target zone in a safe space at home\n- Track your progress in a skills journal\n- Design an obstacle course for rolling objects\n- Spend 10 minutes daily practising - you'll be amazed how quickly you improve!\n\n---\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
