This lesson shows you how to build a weekly fitness routine that works with your schedule and feels good. You'll discover ways to combine different activities into a plan that keeps you motivated to move.\n\n## Setting Up Your Home Fitness Space\nBefore creating your routine, set up a dedicated space for exercise:\n\n**Basic Setup Requirements:**\n- Clear a space at least 6 feet by 6 feet (enough to lie down with arms extended)\n- Remove any breakable items or tripping hazards\n- Have a water bottle nearby for hydration\n- Use a towel or yoga mat for floor exercises if available (a folded blanket works too)\n\n**Troubleshooting Common Space Issues:**\n- Limited space? Focus on stationary exercises and clear just enough room to stand with arms extended\n- Noisy environment? Use headphones for workout videos or create a visual exercise chart\n- Shared space? Schedule your workout time when fewer people are around or create a portable workout kit in a box\n\n## Setting Realistic Weekly Goals\nInstead of asking yourself about goals, complete this concrete goal-setting activity:\n\n1. Fill in this specific goal template in your notebook:\n   \"By the end of this month, I want to be able to _____ (specific physical achievement).\"\n   Examples:\n   - Walk continuously for 15 minutes\n   - Do 10 proper push-ups (or 10 modified push-ups on knees)\n   - Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight\n\n2. Look at your actual schedule and mark exactly when you have 15-30 minute blocks available for exercise. Count how many blocks you have each week.\n\n3. Write down 3 physical activities you genuinely enjoy or are curious to try.\n\nStarting with smaller goals and building up gives you much better results than trying to do too much at once!\n\n## Balancing Different Types of Activities\nYour fitness routine needs different types of movement, similar to how your body needs various foods. Include:\n\n**Cardio Days (2-3 times weekly):** Activities that speed up your heart and breathing:\n- Walking or jogging around your neighbourhood\n- Marching or jogging in place (perfect for small spaces)\n- Dancing to music you love\n- Jumping jacks or jump rope (use an imaginary rope if you don't have one)\n\n**How to know you're doing cardio right:** You should be breathing harder than normal but still able to speak in short sentences. If you can sing easily, increase intensity; if you can't talk at all, decrease intensity.\n\n**Strength Days (2 times weekly):** Exercises that build muscle:\n- Bodyweight moves like push-ups, squats, and lunges\n- Household item weights:\n  * Filled water bottles (16-20 oz) for light weights\n  * Backpack with books for heavier weights\n  * Canned goods for small hand weights\n\n**Beginner strength circuit (repeat 2-3 times):**\n1. 10 wall push-ups (standing at arm's length from wall)\n2. 10 chair squats (lower until you almost touch a chair seat)\n3. 10 standing calf raises\n4. 30-second rest\n\n**Flexibility/Recovery Days (1-2 times weekly):** Helping your body stretch and recover:\n- Basic stretching routine (hold each stretch for 30 seconds):\n  * Reach for toes (hamstring stretch)\n  * Arm across chest (shoulder stretch)\n  * Gentle neck tilts (side to side)\n  * Calf stretch against wall\n- Simple yoga poses: child's pose, downward dog, gentle twists\n\n**Fun Activity Days (1-2 times weekly):** Things you actually look forward to:\n- Solo sports practice (shooting baskets, kicking soccer ball against wall)\n- Follow-along dance videos\n- Exploring your neighborhood on foot or bike\n- Active video games\n\n## Activity Selection Exercise\nComplete this chart in your notebook:\n\n| Activity Type | Activity I'll Try | When I'll Do It | What I Need |\n|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Cardio       | (fill in)         | (fill in)       | (fill in)   |\n| Strength     | (fill in)         | (fill in)       | (fill in)   |\n| Flexibility  | (fill in)         | (fill in)       | (fill in)   |\n| Fun Activity | (fill in)         | (fill in)       | (fill in)   |\n\n## Sample Weekly Schedules for Beginners\nHere's what a week might look like if you're just starting out:\n\n**Beginner Schedule:**\n- Monday: 20-minute walk around your home or neighbourhood (cardio)\n- Tuesday: 15 minutes of basic exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and squats (strength)\n- Wednesday: Rest day or light stretching\n- Thursday: 20-minute bike ride or marching in place at home (cardio)\n- Friday: 15 minutes of yoga or stretching (flexibility)\n- Saturday: Practice basketball skills or another sport by yourself for 30 minutes (fun activity)\n- Sunday: Rest day\n\n**Success Indicators:** You've successfully completed this beginner schedule if:\n- You completed at least 4 of the 5 active days\n- You were able to finish each session without excessive fatigue\n- Your breathing returned to normal within 5 minutes after cardio activities\n- You felt some muscle challenge during strength exercises but could complete all repetitions\n\nAs your strength and stamina improve, you could try this:\n\n**Intermediate Schedule:**\n- Monday: 30-minute jog or fast walk (cardio)\n- Tuesday: 20 minutes of strength exercises with resistance bands or household items (strength)\n- Wednesday: 20 minutes of yoga following an online video (flexibility)\n- Thursday: 30 minutes of dancing to your favorite music or cycling (cardio)\n- Friday: Rest day\n- Saturday: 45 minutes practicing sports skills or playing an active game (fun activity)\n- Sunday: 15 minutes of stretching (recovery)\n\n## Creating Workouts with Available Resources\nNo fancy equipment needed! Here's what works with items you already have:\n\n**At Home:**\n- Water bottle weights: Fill bottles with water for 1-2 pound weights (add sand for more)\n- Chair exercises: Use a sturdy chair for modified squats, tricep dips, and step-ups\n- Towel resistance: Pull against a folded towel for resistance training\n- Stair workouts: Walk up and down stairs for 5 minutes (or step up and down on a single sturdy step)\n\n**In Your Yard or Nearby:**\n- Wall push-ups: Use an exterior wall for modified push-ups\n- Curb or step exercises: Use for calf raises and step-ups\n- Natural movements: Practice balancing on logs, stepping over obstacles\n- Distance markers: Use trees, poles or signs to mark walking/running intervals\n\n**Indoor Alternatives for Bad Weather:**\n- Indoor circuit: 30 seconds each of marching in place, squats, push-ups, and jumping jacks\n- Commercial break challenge: Do one exercise during each TV commercial\n- Room-to-room workout: Assign different exercises to different rooms and rotate\n- Hallway shuttle: Jog or shuffle quickly from one end to the other 10 times\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Exercise Challenges\n- **If you feel pain (not just muscle fatigue):** Stop immediately, rest, and try a modified version next time\n- **If you get bored:** Create a workout playlist with your favorite upbeat songs or exercise during a TV show\n- **If you're too tired:** Try exercising at a different time of day or reduce the intensity but maintain frequency\n- **If you forget to exercise:** Set a daily alarm on your phone or link exercise to another daily habit (like before dinner)\n\n## Building Variety to Keep Exercise Interesting\nThe same workout day after day gets boring quickly. Mix things up by:\n\n- Trying one new activity each month\n- Creating milestone challenges: Track your progress toward specific achievements like 10 push-ups or a 1-minute plank\n- Changing your environment: Rotate between different areas in/around your home\n- Creating themed workout days: \"Music Monday\" with favorite songs, \"Challenge Tuesday\" with new exercises\n- Tracking progress: Keep a simple chart showing which days you exercised and one improvement you noticed\n\n## Weekly Fitness Plan Creation\nComplete this template in your notebook to design your personal weekly fitness plan:\n\n**My Weekly Fitness Plan**\n\n| Day | Activity Type | Specific Exercise | Time | Location | Equipment Needed |\n|-----|--------------|-------------------|------|----------|------------------|\n| Mon | | | | | |\n| Tue | | | | | |\n| Wed | | | | | |\n| Thu | | | | | |\n| Fri | | | | | |\n| Sat | | | | | |\n| Sun | | | | | |\n\n**My Success Indicators:**\n- I will know my cardio is improving when: _______\n- I will know my strength is improving when: _______\n- I will know my flexibility is improving when: _______\n\n**Example of a Completed Plan:**\nMonday: Cardio - 20 min walking - Around block - Supportive shoes\nTuesday: Strength - Water bottle arm exercises - Bedroom - 2 water bottles\nWednesday: Rest day\nThursday: Cardio - Dance video - Living room - Internet device\nFriday: Flexibility - Basic stretching routine - Bedroom - Yoga mat/towel\nSaturday: Fun - Basketball practice - Driveway - Basketball\nSunday: Light activity - Family walk - Park - Comfortable clothes\n\n## Self-Reflection After One Week\nAfter following your plan for one week, answer these questions:\n1. Which activities did I enjoy most and why?\n2. Which activities were challenging but doable?\n3. Which activities need modification to work better?\n4. What is one physical improvement I've noticed?\n5.
