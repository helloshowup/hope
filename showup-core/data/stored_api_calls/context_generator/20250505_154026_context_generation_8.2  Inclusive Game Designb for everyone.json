Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content focuses on the principles of inclusive game design, with the goal of helping learners understand how to create games that are accessible and enjoyable for all participants. The content includes an introductory activity to build awareness around physical limitations, followed by an overview of four key principles of inclusive game design. The content is structured to guide learners through understanding the concepts and then applying them through a reflective activity.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests the following:\n1. Add a linking paragraph to transition between the introductory activity and the principles of inclusive game design.\n2. Rework the final section on applying the principles into a simple, guided activity where learners can fill out a provided table.\n3. Insert a focused checkpoint that invites learners to pause and reflect on how the concepts connect to their existing knowledge or experience.\n4. Add a \"Key Takeaways\" section that extracts the 1-3 most critical concepts from the content.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students in a physical education course, with the content delivered through an asynchronous online curriculum. Key considerations:\n- Language and Readability: Keep content at a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday words and active voice.\n- Structure and Organization: Break information into clear, concise sections with frequent headings, subheadings, and visual breaks.\n- Visual Elements: Include relevant images, diagrams, and illustrations to support understanding of concepts and activities.\n- Engagement Strategies: Use a conversational tone, connect to real-world examples, and create achievable challenges that can be done in various home environments.\n- Equipment and Space Considerations: Provide alternatives using common household items and suggest adaptations for small or shared living spaces.\n- Safety Guidelines: Clearly communicate safety warnings and offer modified versions for different physical abilities.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained and easy to navigate, with a focus on clear explanations, visual aids, and structured activities.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity of the content by preserving the core learning objectives and key principles of inclusive game design.\n- Enhance the content to be more engaging and accessible for the target middle school audience, while avoiding oversimplification.\n- Ensure a smooth flow and logical progression between sections, with clear transitions and connections.\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online format, leveraging visual elements and structured activities to support self-guided learning.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Craft a transitional paragraph to bridge the introductory activity and the principles of inclusive game design, using a conversational tone and relatable examples.\n2. Redesign the final section into a guided activity where learners can reflect on how to apply the principles to a game they are familiar with. Provide a simple table format for them to fill out.\n3. Develop a focused checkpoint that encourages learners to pause and consider how the concepts relate to their own experiences or prior knowledge. Frame the checkpoint as a thought-provoking question without requiring a written response.\n4. Analyze the content to identify the 1-3 most critical concepts, and present them as concise, actionable key takeaways in a dedicated section at the end of the content.\n5. Throughout the enhancement, maintain the content's educational integrity, adapt the language and complexity to the target audience, and optimize the delivery for the asynchronous online format."
