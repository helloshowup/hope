These skills help you move safely and effectively, giving you the foundation needed for success in sports, games, and everyday movement. This lesson builds on our previous work with non-locomotor movements and sets you up for future balance and coordination activities.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Distinguish between personal space and general space\n- Demonstrate directional movements (forward, backward, sideways, up, down)\n- Move your body at different levels (high, medium, low)\n- Create various body shapes (wide, narrow, curved, twisted)\n- Apply spatial awareness in simple movement challenges\n\n## Getting Started (5 minutes)\nLet's warm up with a quick game of \"Space Invaders\":\n- Find your own space in the gym\n- When you hear \"personal space bubble,\" extend your arms to show your bubble\n- When you hear \"general space move,\" walk carefully through the space without touching others\n- When you freeze, ask yourself: \"Am I in my own personal space? How do I know?\"\n\nThink of your body awareness as your internal navigation system - it helps you know where you are and how to move safely around others!\n\n## Personal vs. General Space (10 minutes)\nLet's understand the difference:\n- Personal space: The bubble around your body that moves with you - about arm's length in all directions\n- General space: The shared area we all move through - like our gym\n\nActivity: \"Space Explorers\"\n1. Stand in your space and create your \"personal space bubble\" by reaching in all directions\n2. Make different shapes within your bubble (tall, small, wide, twisted)\n3. Practise moving through general space using different movements (walking, skipping) while respecting others' personal space\n4. Think about: When do you need to be aware of personal space? (crowded hallways, playing basketball, dancing)\n\n## Directional Movements (10 minutes)\nThe main directions are:\n- Forward/backward: Moving toward/away from where you're facing\n- Sideways: Moving to your right or left side\n- Up/down: Moving toward the ceiling or floor\n\nActivity: \"Direction Detective\"\n1. Follow this simple movement sequence:\n   - 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward\n   - 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left\n   - Reach up high, crouch down low\n2. Follow along, then create your own sequences with a partner\n3. Challenge: Can you move in two directions at once? (like sideways and up)\n\n## Levels of Movement (10 minutes)\nThe three main levels are:\n- High level: Movements that reach toward the ceiling (jumping, reaching up)\n- Medium level: Movements at waist or chest height (walking, arm circles)\n- Low level: Movements close to the floor (crawling, crouching)\n\nActivity: \"Level Shifters\"\n1. Notice the level cards (high, medium, low) around the gym\n2. Move freely while the music plays\n3. When music stops, go to the level that's called out\n4. At each card, create a movement or shape at that level\n5. Think about: What sports use different levels? Basketball (all levels), bowling (low), volleyball (high)\n\n## Body Shapes (10 minutes)\nFour basic body shapes are:\n- Wide: Stretching out to take up more space (star jump)\n- Narrow: Making yourself thin or skinny (pencil position)\n- Curved: Creating rounded shapes with your body (ball shape)\n- Twisted: Rotating parts of your body in different directions (twist at waist)\n\nActivity: \"Shape Shifters\"\n1. Create the shapes that are called out\n2. Play \"Shape Freeze Dance\" - when music stops, make the shape that's called\n3. Partner challenge: One partner creates a shape, the other copies it\n4. Group challenge: Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together\n\n## Conclusion and Assessment (5 minutes)\nShow what you've learnt in the \"Spatial Awareness Challenge\":\n1. Respond to prompts like:\n   - \"Show me a wide shape at a high level\"\n   - \"Move backward at a low level\"\n   - \"Create a twisted shape in your personal space\"\n   - \"Travel sideways through general space at a medium level\"\n\n## Over to You\n- Why is spatial awareness important in physical education?\n- How might these skills help you in your favourite sport or activity?\n- What did you find challenging about today's activities?\n\nThese skills connect to our previous work on non-locomotor movements and will help with our upcoming activities on balance and coordination.\n\n## Extensions and Adaptations\n- For extra challenge: Try combining multiple concepts (create a twisted shape while moving backward at a low level)\n- For support: Use the visual cards showing different shapes and levels\n- Connection to other subjects: These directions relate to maths (coordinate planes) or dance (choreography)\n- Technology option: Watch recordings of your movements for self-assessment\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
