Everyone experiences it! You might feel it before a test, during an argument with a friend, or when trying something new.\n\nWhen you're stressed, your body responds in specific ways:\n- Your muscles get tight and tense\n- Your heart beats faster\n- Your breathing gets quicker and shallower\n- You might find it hard to focus or think clearly\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person showing physical signs of stress with labelled arrows pointing to tense shoulders, racing heart, and worried expression]\n\n## What is Stress?\nYour body naturally reacts when you feel challenged or threatened - that's stress. Everyone experiences it! You might feel it before a test, during an argument with a friend, or when trying something new.\n\nWhen you're stressed, your body responds in specific ways:\n- Your muscles get tight and tense\n- Your heart beats faster\n- Your breathing gets quicker and shallower\n- You might find it hard to focus or think clearly\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person showing physical signs of stress with labelled arrows pointing to tense shoulders, racing heart, and worried expression]\n\n## How Movement Helps Beat Stress\n\nMoving your body is one of the most effective ways to fight stress! Here's how it helps:\n\n### Feel-Good Brain Chemicals\nWhen you exercise, your brain releases special chemicals called endorphins. These are your body's natural mood boosters! They help you feel happier and more relaxed.\n\n### Burns Off Extra Energy\nStress can make you feel jumpy or restless. Moving your body helps use up this extra energy so you feel calmer.\n\n### Helps You Sleep Better\nRegular exercise helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly. Getting enough good sleep makes a real difference in how you handle stress.\n\n### Takes Your Mind Off Worries\nWhen you focus on moving your body, your brain gets a break from thinking about what's stressing you out.\n\n![Image: Simple diagram showing how exercise affects the brain with arrows connecting movement to positive outcomes]\n\n## Stress-Busting Moves You Can Try at Home\n\nTry these activities when you're feeling stressed. You don't need special equipment or a lot of space!\n\n### 1. Tension Release Stretches\n**What you need:** Just your body and enough space to stretch your arms out\n**Time needed:** About 5 minutes, go at your own pace\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart\n2. Take a deep breath in while raising your shoulders up to your ears\n3. Hold for 3 seconds, feeling the tension\n4. Breathe out and drop your shoulders down, releasing all the tension\n5. Repeat 5 times\n6. Try the same with other body parts - make fists then release, scrunch your face then relax\n\n**Safety tip:** Never stretch to the point of pain. You should feel a gentle pull, not sharp pain.\n\n![Image: Simple illustrations showing the shoulder tension-release sequence]\n\n### 2. Energy Burners\n**What you need:** A small space where you can move freely\n**Time needed:** As long as feels good for you (3-5 minutes is a good start)\n\nChoose from these quick moves:\n- Jumping jacks - Do as many as comfortable, take breaks when needed\n- Invisible jump rope - Pretend to jump rope for as long as you like\n- Dance party - Put on your favourite song and dance however you want!\n\n**Modification:** If you need to stay quiet, try \"silent\" versions - smaller movements without the jumping. If space is limited, you can march in place or do smaller movements.\n\n![Image: Simple illustrations of the three energy-burning activities]\n\n### 3. Calm-Down Corner\n**What you need:** A quiet spot where you can sit comfortably\n**Time needed:** As long as you need to feel calmer\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Find a comfortable sitting position\n2. Place one hand on your belly\n3. Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts (feel your belly expand)\n4. Hold your breath for 2 counts\n5. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 6 counts\n6. Repeat until you feel calmer (about 10 times is a good start)\n\n**Tip:** This is called \"belly breathing\" and it helps calm your nervous system quickly!\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person doing belly breathing with arrows showing the breath movement]\n\n## Know Your Stress Signals\n\nEveryone shows stress differently. Recognizing your personal stress signals helps you catch stress early!\n\n### Stop and Think\nCheck in with your body right now. Do you notice any of these common stress signals?\n\n- Tight jaw or clenched teeth\n- Headache or feeling dizzy\n- Stomachache or butterflies\n- Cold or sweaty hands\n- Racing thoughts\n- Feeling irritable or cranky\n\nWrite down the signals you notice when you're stressed. These are YOUR stress warning signs!\n\n![Image: Body outline with common stress points highlighted]\n\n## Over to You!\n\n**Your Stress-Busting Plan**\n1. Pick one movement activity from this lesson that you want to try\n2. Decide when you'll do it (after school? before bed?)\n3. Try it for at least 5 minutes\n4. Notice how you feel before and after\n\n**Remember:** Moving your body is just one way to handle stress. Getting enough sleep, talking to someone you trust, and taking breaks are all valuable too!\n\n## Check Your Understanding\nTake a moment to reflect on what you've learned:\n\nThink about two ways stress affects your body. Notice how exercise helps reduce your stress. Consider which stress-busting activity would work best when you need to be quiet. Identify two of your personal stress signals that you'll watch for in the future.\n\nUnderstanding these points helps you better manage stress through movement!\n\n## Need Help?\nIf stress feels too big to handle on your own, that's okay! Talk to a trusted adult like a parent, teacher, or school counsellor. They can help you find more ways to manage stress.\n</CONTENT>\n",
