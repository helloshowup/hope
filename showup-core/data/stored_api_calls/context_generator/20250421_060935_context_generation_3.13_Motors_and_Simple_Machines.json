Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

When you plug in a robot or turn it on with batteries, electrical energy flows through its motors. These motors use special properties of electricity and magnetism to create spinning or pushing motions that make the robot move. It's similar to how your muscles convert the energy from food into movement, except robots use electricity instead. This amazing conversion process happens in a fraction of a second and can be precisely controlled, allowing robots to perform delicate tasks like picking up eggs or powerful jobs like lifting heavy objects.\n\n## **Understanding Motors in Robotics**\n\n### **How Motors Generate Movement**\n\nMotors work using a fascinating principle called **electromagnetism**. When electricity flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field around that wire. Inside a motor, this wire is coiled around a central shaft (called a rotor). This rotor sits between permanent magnets. \n\nWhen electricity flows through the coils, they become temporary electromagnets. These electromagnets interact with the permanent magnets - opposites attract and likes repel. This pushing and pulling force causes the rotor to spin. By controlling when and how much electricity flows through the coils, we can make the motor spin faster, slower, or even change direction.\n\nThink of it like invisible hands pushing and pulling on a merry-go-round. The electricity provides the energy, and the magnetic fields convert that energy into a spinning motion that robots can use to move wheels, arms, or other parts.\n\n### **Motor Components and Function**\n\nA typical motor contains several key parts working together:\n\nThe **stator** is the stationary outer part of the motor that usually contains permanent magnets or electromagnets. It creates a stable magnetic field.\n\nThe **rotor** is the inner part that spins. It contains wire coils wrapped around an iron core and is attached to the output shaft that delivers the rotational force.\n\nMany motors also have a **commutator**, which is a split ring that reverses the direction of the electric current at just the right moment to keep the rotor spinning continuously.\n\n**Brushes** are small pieces of carbon that press against the commutator, delivering electricity to the spinning rotor. Some advanced motors are \"brushless\" and use electronics instead of physical brushes.\n\nAll these parts work together like a well-choreographed dance. The stator provides the magnetic field, electricity flows through the brushes to the commutator, which energizes the rotor coils at precisely the right moments, creating a continuous spinning motion that powers your robot's movements.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Motors work by using electromagnetism - when electricity flows through coiled wires, it creates magnetic fields that push and pull against permanent magnets to create spinning motion.\n- A motor has four main parts: the stator (outer part with magnets), the rotor (inner part that spins), the commutator (splits the ring to keep motion going), and brushes (deliver electricity to the spinning parts).\n- Motors act like the muscles of robots, converting electrical energy into mechanical movement that powers wheels, arms, and other robot parts.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
