Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Fortunately, simple techniques can help you manage it effectively. This lesson introduces relaxation methods you can personalize to fit your needs. You'll discover various approaches - from quick solutions for sudden stress to deeper practices for when you have more time.\n\n## Quick Stress-Busters\nThese rapid techniques help when stress appears suddenly:\n\n**Deep Breathing**\n1. Sit up straight or stand tall\n2. Breathe in slowly through your nose while counting to 4\n3. Hold your breath for a count of 2\n4. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of 6\n5. Repeat 3 times\n\n**Stretch It Out**\n1. Reach your arms up high toward the ceiling\n2. Slowly bend to one side, then the other\n3. Roll your shoulders backward 5 times\n4. Gently turn your head from side to side\n\n**The 5-4-3-2-1 Game**\nLook around and find:\n\n- 5 things you can see\n- 4 things you can touch\n- 3 things you can hear\n- 2 things you can smell\n- 1 thing you can taste\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.\nAfter trying each stress-buster, write down how your body feels different. Rate your stress level before and after on a scale of 1-10. Example: \"Before deep breathing: 7/10, After: 4/10. My shoulders feel less tight and my breathing is slower.\"] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n## Short Relaxation Breaks\nWhen you have a few minutes, try these reset activities:\n\n**Relaxing Your Muscles**\n1. Find a comfortable spot to sit or lie down\n2. Start at your toes and squeeze them tight for 5 seconds\n3. Release and feel them relax\n4. Move up to your feet, then legs, and continue all the way to your face\n5. Notice how different your body feels when you finish\n\n<br/>\n\n**Mini Movement Break**\n1. March in place for 30 seconds\n2. Do 10 arm circles forward and backward\n3. Stretch your arms out wide, then give yourself a hug\n4. Gently twist your upper body from side to side\n5. End with 5 deep breaths\n\n**Calm Bubble**\n1. Sit in a comfortable position\n2. Close your eyes or look at one spot\n3. Imagine yourself inside a giant, protective bubble\n4. Picture your bubble filled with your favourite colour\n5. Breathe deeply and feel safe in your bubble for 3-5 minutes\n\n**Safety Note:** Stop immediately if any movement hurts. These activities should feel good, not painful!\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you can't focus: Try setting a timer so you don't worry about time\n- If you feel silly: Practice when alone until it feels more natural\n- If you can't get comfortable: Use pillows or try a different position\n- If your mind keeps wandering: That's normal! Just gently bring your attention back each time\n\n## Longer Calming Practices\nFor deeper relaxation when time allows:\n\n**Peaceful Place Journey**\n1. Find a quiet spot where you won't be disturbed\n2. Sit or lie down comfortably\n3. Close your eyes and take 5 deep breaths\n4. Imagine a place where you feel completely safe and happy\n5. What do you see there? What sounds do you hear?\n6. Can you feel the temperature? Are there any smells?\n7. Spend 10 minutes exploring this special place in your mind\n8. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes\n\n**Activity Extension:** Draw or write about your peaceful place after you finish. Include as many details as possible about what you saw, heard, felt, and smelled. Keep this description nearby to remind you of this place when you feel stressed.\n\n**Gentle Movement Flow**\n1. Start by standing tall, feet hip-width apart\n2. Raise your arms slowly as you breathe in\n3. Lower them as you breathe out\n4. Gently bend forward, only as far as feels comfortable\n5. Roll back up slowly, one vertebra at a time (that means one back bone at a time)\n6. Repeat this flow 5-10 times, moving with your breath\n7. End by standing still and noticing how your body feels\n\n**Adaptation Options:**\n- Limited space? Try the Gentle Movement Flow while sitting in a chair with smaller movements\n- Physical limitations? Stay seated and focus on arm movements and breathing\n- Difficulty concentrating? Start with just 2-3 repetitions and gradually build up\n- Need more challenge? Add gentle twists or side bends between movements\n\n## When to Use Different Techniques\nMatch your relaxation tools to specific situations:\n\n**Use Quick Stress-Busters when:**\n- You feel suddenly nervous before a test\n- You're frustrated with homework\n- You're about to have a difficult conversation\n- You notice your heart beating fast\n\n**Try Short Relaxation Breaks when:**\n- You need a study break\n- You feel tired but still have work to do\n- You want to calm down after playing or exercising\n- You're having trouble focusing\n\n**Use Longer Calming Practices when:**\n- You have time before bed to wind down\n- You feel overwhelmed by big emotions\n- You need deep relaxation after a busy day\n- You want some proper self-care time on weekends\n\n**Tracking Activity:** Create a simple stress journal using a notebook or your phone. Each time you feel stressed, write down:\n1. What caused the stress\n2. Which technique you used\n3. How well it worked (1-5 stars)\n\n**What You Need:**\n- A comfortable spot to sit or lie down\n- Something soft (pillow, blanket, stuffed animal)\n- Items that help you feel calm (pictures, small objects)\n\n**Setting Up Your Space:**\n1. Choose a quiet corner of your room or home\n2. Make it comfortable with pillows or blankets\n3. Add things that make you happy (photos, drawings, special items)\n4. Keep it clean and organised\n\n**No Space? No Problem!**\nIf you don't have much room:\n\n- Use a special pillow that becomes your \"calm spot\"\n- Create a small box with calming items you can take anywhere\n- Hang a picture that reminds you to breathe and relax\n\n![Image: Example of a simple calm-down corner with pillows and minimal materials]\n\n**Setup Checklist:**\n- [ ] Found a location (even if small)\n- [ ] Added at least one comfortable item\n- [ ] Included something visual that calms me\n- [ ] Made sure I can use this space for at least 10 minutes uninterrupted\n- [ ] Tested the space by practicing one relaxation technique there\n\n## Practice Your Toolkit\nNow it's time to create your personal stress-busting plan:\n\n**Step 1:** Try each technique at least once and rate how it made you feel (1-5 stars)\n**Step 2:** Complete this chart:\n\nMy favorite quick stress-buster: _________________ (When I'll use it: _________________)\nMy chosen short relaxation break: _________________ (When I'll use it: _________________)\nMy selected longer calming practice: _________________ (When I'll use it: _________________)\n\n**My Weekly Stress-Busting Schedule:**\n- Morning: 1-minute deep breathing to start the day\n- After lunch: 5-minute relaxing muscles break\n- Evening: 15-minute peaceful place journey before bed\n\n**Success Indicators:** You'll know your relaxation practice is working when:\n- Your breathing becomes slower and deeper\n- Your muscles feel less tense\n- Your mind feels clearer\n- You can focus better after the activity\n- You feel more in control of your emotions\n\n## Wrap-Up\nCongratulations! You've built your personal stress-busting toolkit. Managing stress improves with practice, just like any skill. Experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you. Your toolkit will evolve as you grow.\n\n**Final Reflection Activity:** \n1. Write down three situations from the past week when you could have used a relaxation technique\n2. For each situation, note which technique would have helped most\n3. Set a specific goal for using your new skills this week (Example: \"I will use deep breathing before my math test on Thursday\")\n4. After one week of practice, review what worked well and what you want to adjust\n\n<br/>\nRemember: These skills take practice! Be patient with yourself as you learn what works best for you.\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Different relaxation techniques work for different situations - quick stress-busters help in sudden stress moments, while longer practices are better when you have more time.\n- Creating your own calm-down space, even if it's small, gives you a special place to practice relaxation techniques.\n- Regular practice of relaxation techniques helps you manage stress better, just like any other skill you're learning.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
