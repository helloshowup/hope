Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary fitness terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new exercise or activity\n- Use diagrams to show proper body positions and form\n- Add labeled illustrations for exercise variations and modifications\n- Include visual examples of completed activities\n- Provide clear visual representations of safety considerations\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make fitness concepts relatable\n- Create achievable challenges that can be done in various home environments\n\n### Equipment and Space Considerations\n- Provide alternatives using common household items\n- Include adaptations for small spaces (apartment, bedroom, hallway)\n- Design activities with minimal noise impact for shared living spaces\n- Offer variations for different surfaces (carpet, hard floor, outdoors)\n- Suggest creative solutions for tracking progress without specialized equipment\n\n### Safety Guidelines\n- Provide clear safety warnings for each activity\n- Include detailed warm-up and cool-down instructions\n- Offer modified versions for different physical abilities\n- Emphasize proper form over speed or repetitions\n- Include guidance for when to stop an activity if discomfort occurs\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n- Include printable tracking sheets with simple, clear layouts\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"Cardiovascular endurance activities enhance pulmonary efficiency, enabling sustained physical exertion through improved oxygen utilization across multiple muscle groups.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"Cardio exercises make your heart and lungs stronger. This helps your body use oxygen better. When your heart and lungs are strong, you can be active longer without getting tired.\"\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 4.2 Bodyweight Training: Using Your Body to Get Stronger!\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Explain why bodyweight exercises are a good way to get stronger\n- Show how to do at least 3 different bodyweight exercises correctly\n- Create a short workout using your favorite bodyweight exercises\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Exercise mat or folded blanket (optional)\n- Water bottle\n- Clock, watch, or phone timer\n- Sturdy chair (for chair dips)\n- Small pieces of paper (for Exercise Cards activity)\n- Notebook or paper (for tracking progress)\n- Pen or pencil\n\nYour body works as natural exercise equipment! Bodyweight training relies on your own weight to challenge your muscles. During push-ups, your arms lift a portion of your body weight. When performing squats, your leg muscles control lowering and raising your body.\n\nThe real advantage? These exercises require no equipment and fit almost anywhere in your day. You can do them while watching television, before bedtime, or in any small space at home to strengthen your muscles.\n\n## Setting Up Your Home Exercise Space\n\nBefore starting, create a safe exercise area:\n1. **Clear a space**: Remove any furniture, toys, or objects that might get in your way or cause trips\n2. **Surface check**: Find a carpeted area or use an exercise mat (a folded blanket works too!)\n3. **Water station**: Keep a water bottle nearby to stay hydrated\n4. **Clothing**: Wear comfortable clothes that let you move freely\n5. **Timer**: Have a clock, watch, or phone timer ready to track exercise time\n\nIf you don't have much space, that's okay! Most of these exercises need only enough room to lie down with arms extended.\n\n## Awesome Bodyweight Exercises You Can Try\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert an \"Audio Instructions\" section within the markers ---audioinstructions--- and ---audioinstructionsEND---.

| How I Felt |\n   |-----|------------------|------------|------------|\n   | Mon |                  |            |            |\n   | Tue |                  |            |            |\n   | Wed |                  |            |            |\n\n2. **Exercise Cards**: \n   - Cut 12 small pieces of paper\n   - Write one exercise on each card with repetitions (example: \"10 Squats\")\n   - Shuffle cards and draw 3-5 for your daily workout\n   - **Sample workout from cards**: 10 squats, 8 curl-ups, 10-second plank, 8 arm circles\n\n3. **Personal Fitness Challenge**: \n   - Choose ONE exercise to improve\n   - Record your starting point (example: 5-second plank)\n   - Set a specific goal (example: 30-second plank)\n   - Practice daily, adding small increments (example: add 2-3 seconds each day)\n   - Track progress in a notebook or on your phone\n   - **Success measure**: Reaching your goal within 2 weeks\n\n4. **Create Your Own Routine**: \n   - Select one exercise for each body part (arms, shoulders, chest, back, core, legs)\n   - Arrange them in an order you enjoy\n   - Perform each exercise for 30 seconds with 15 seconds rest between\n   - Practice your routine 3 times per week\n   - **Example routine**:\n     1. 10 squats\n     2. 5 modified push-ups\n     3. 15-second plank\n     4. 8 backward snow angels\n     5. 10 calf raises\n   - **Success measure**: Completing the full routine without stopping\n\n## Self-Assessment and Reflection\n\nAfter trying these exercises for one week, take a moment to check your progress:\n\n1. **Physical progress**: (Circle the statement that best applies)\n   - I can do more repetitions than when I started\n   - I can hold positions longer than when I started\n   - I can perform exercises with better form\n   - I need more time to see physical changes\n\n2. **Knowledge check**: (Answer these questions in your notebook)\n   - Name three bodyweight exercises and which muscles they work\n   - Explain two ways to make an exercise easier and two ways to make it harder\n   - Describe proper form for a squat\n\n3. **Personal reflection**: (Write 2-3 sentences for each)\n   - Which exercises felt easiest and which challenged you most?\n   - What sensations did you notice during and after exercising?\n   - When could you include these exercises in your daily schedule?\n   - Which three exercises would you combine for a quick workout?\n\nNow that you've learned these exercises, you have a powerful toolkit for getting stronger anywhere! Regular practice will help improve your strength, endurance, and overall physical well-being. Remember that everyone starts at different levels—it's completely normal if you can only complete a few repetitions at first. The important thing is consistent effort, which leads to daily improvements!\n\n**Weekly goal suggestion**: Try to complete at least 10 minutes of bodyweight exercises three times per week. You can break this into shorter sessions throughout the day (like 2 minutes during five different commercial breaks).\n\nNext time you have a few spare minutes or are watching TV, challenge yourself to try a few squats, push-ups, or planks. Your muscles will thank you for the workout!\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Bodyweight exercises use your own body as resistance to build strength without special equipment, making them perfect for exercising anywhere with limited space and resources.\n- Proper form is essential for safety and effectiveness—keep your back straight, breathe normally, and modify exercises to match your current ability level.\n- Consistency matters more than intensity—even short, regular practice sessions (10 minutes, three times weekly) will help you build strength and improve your physical well-being over time.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
