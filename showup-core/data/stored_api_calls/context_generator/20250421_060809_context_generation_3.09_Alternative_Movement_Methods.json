Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

Just like animals have evolved special ways to move in their habitats, engineers design robots with movement methods suited to specific tasks and places. In this podcast, we explore how a snake-like robot might slither through narrow pipes to find leaks, while a jellyfish-inspired robot gently explores coral reefs without causing damage. Engineers often look to nature for inspiration, creating robots that can fly like birds, swim like fish, or climb like geckos. These specialized movement solutions help robots work in places that might be dangerous or impossible for humans to reach, from deep ocean trenches to disaster zones with unstable buildings.\n\n\n## **Aerial Robot Movement**\n\nThis section explores how robots navigate through air, including the engineering principles behind different flight methods.\n\n### **Propeller-Based Flight**\n\n**Propeller-based flight** is the most common way robots fly through the air. Drones and **quadcopters** use multiple spinning propellers (usually four, which is why they're called \"quad\" copters) to lift off the ground and move in any direction. Each propeller creates thrust by pushing air downward, and by changing the speed of different propellers, the robot can tilt and move in different directions.\n\nThese flying robots need careful control systems to stay stable in the air. Small sensors detect the robot's position and movement hundreds of times per second, and computers make tiny adjustments to keep the robot balanced. Most propeller-based robots use batteries for power, which limits how long they can fly – usually between 15-30 minutes before needing a recharge.\n\nPropeller-based robots are great for tasks like taking aerial photos, delivering small packages, or inspecting tall buildings where it might be dangerous for humans to climb. For example, utility companies now use drone robots to inspect power lines after storms, keeping workers safe while quickly finding damaged equipment. These drones use cameras to capture detailed images and can even use thermal sensors to detect overheating connections that might cause fires.\n\n### **Fixed and Flapping Wing Designs**\n\nSome aerial robots use wings instead of propellers to fly. **Fixed-wing robots** look like small airplanes with wings that don't move. They're more energy-efficient than propeller drones and can fly for longer periods, sometimes hours instead of minutes. However, they need to keep moving forward to stay in the air and can't hover in one spot like quadcopters.\n\nOther robots use flapping wings that mimic birds or insects. These **ornithopters** (bird-like) or **entomopters** (insect-like) robots are still being developed but offer some amazing advantages. They can be very small – some experimental insect robots are no bigger than a quarter! They can also be more maneuverable in tight spaces like indoor environments or forests.\n\nScientists study how birds like hummingbirds hover and how insects like dragonflies make quick turns to improve these robot designs. These nature-inspired robots might someday help with pollinating plants, searching for survivors in collapsed buildings, or exploring other planets.\n\nRecent advances in lightweight materials have made these flying robots much more practical. New carbon fiber composites and flexible plastics allow engineers to build wings that are both strong and lightweight. Some of the newest flapping-wing robots can even change their wing shape during flight, just like real birds do when they transition from fast flight to hovering.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Different flying robots use propellers, fixed wings, or flapping wings, each designed for specific tasks and environments.\n- Propeller-based drones use sensors and computers to stay balanced in the air, making them ideal for hovering tasks like inspections, but they have limited flight time.\n- Fixed-wing robots fly longer but can't hover, while flapping-wing robots inspired by birds and insects offer better maneuverability in tight spaces.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
