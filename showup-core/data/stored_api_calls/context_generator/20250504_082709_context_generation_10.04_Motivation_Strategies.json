Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\n# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary fitness terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new exercise or activity\n- Use diagrams to show proper body positions and form\n- Add labeled illustrations for exercise variations and modifications\n- Include visual examples of completed activities\n- Provide clear visual representations of safety considerations\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make fitness concepts relatable\n- Create achievable challenges that can be done in various home environments\n\n### Equipment and Space Considerations\n- Provide alternatives using common household items\n- Include adaptations for small spaces (apartment, bedroom, hallway)\n- Design activities with minimal noise impact for shared living spaces\n- Offer variations for different surfaces (carpet, hard floor, outdoors)\n- Suggest creative solutions for tracking progress without specialized equipment\n\n### Safety Guidelines\n- Provide clear safety warnings for each activity\n- Include detailed warm-up and cool-down instructions\n- Offer modified versions for different physical abilities\n- Emphasize proper form over speed or repetitions\n- Include guidance for when to stop an activity if discomfort occurs\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n- Include printable tracking sheets with simple, clear layouts\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"Cardiovascular endurance activities enhance pulmonary efficiency, enabling sustained physical exertion through improved oxygen utilization across multiple muscle groups.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"Cardio exercises make your heart and lungs stronger.

Finding ways to stay motivated now will help you build healthy habits that last a lifetime!\n\n## Think About Your Motivation\n\nWhat physical activities do you enjoy most? How do you feel before, during and after you exercise?\n\nEveryone has days when they don't feel like being active. That's completely normal! The trick is having strategies to help you stay motivated even on tough days.\n\n## Two Types of Motivation\n\nThere are two main ways we get motivated to be active:\n\n**Internal Motivation** - This comes from inside you:\n- You enjoy how the activity feels\n- You feel proud when you improve\n- You like how exercise makes your body feel stronger\n\n**External Motivation** - This comes from outside you:\n- Getting rewards or prizes\n- Having someone praise you\n- Avoiding getting in trouble\n\n![Image: Two side-by-side illustrations showing internal motivation (person smiling while exercising) and external motivation (person receiving a medal)](placeholder-image)\n\nBoth types of motivation help, but internal motivation typically lasts longer. When you truly enjoy an activity, you're more likely to stick with it!\n\n## Building Exercise Habits That Last\n\nThe best way to stay active is to make exercise a regular habit. Here's how:\n\n1. **Start small**\n   - Begin with just 10 minutes of activity\n   - Choose something you actually enjoy\n   - Exercise 2-3 times per week\n\n2. **Gradually do more**\n   - Add 5 minutes to your workout each week\n   - Try new activities as you get stronger\n   - Slowly increase how many days you exercise\n\n3. **Connect exercise to daily routines**\n   - Exercise right after another habit (like after brushing teeth)\n   - Do it at the same time each day\n   - Put your exercise clothes where you'll see them\n\n## Over to You\nCreate a simple exercise plan for one week. Choose activities you enjoy and can do in your available space.\n\n![Image: Diagram showing gradual progression from 10 minutes to 30 minutes of activity](placeholder-image)\n\n## Using Support From Others\n\nHaving people who encourage you makes staying active much easier!\n\n**Ways to get support:**\n- Ask a family member to exercise with you\n- Share your goals with a friend\n- Join online exercise groups or challenges\n- Follow kid-friendly workout videos\n\n**No equipment? No problem!**\n- Use canned food as weights\n- Use a chair for support during exercises\n- Make an obstacle course with pillows and furniture\n- Use a rolled-up sock as a ball\n\n![Image: Child exercising at home using household items](placeholder-image)\n\n## Safety First!\n- Always warm up for 5 minutes before exercising\n- Start with easier versions of exercises\n- Stop if you feel pain (not just muscle tiredness)\n- Drink water before, during and after activity\n- Make sure you have enough space to move safely\n\n## Tracking Your Progress\n\nSeeing your improvement helps you stay motivated!\n\n**Simple ways to track progress:**\n- Keep a calendar and mark days you exercise\n- Write down how long you exercised each day\n- Note how you felt during and after exercise\n- Track how many repetitions you can do\n\n## Over to You\nCreate a simple tracking sheet using this template:\n\n| Day | Activity | Time | How I Felt |\n|-----|----------|------|------------|\n| Monday | | | |\n| Tuesday | | | |\n| Wednesday | | | |\n| Thursday | | | |\n| Friday | | | |\n| Saturday | | | |\n| Sunday | | | |\n\n![Image: Sample completed tracking sheet](placeholder-image)\n\n## Getting Back on Track\n\nEveryone misses exercise days sometimes. Here's how to get back to your routine:\n\n1. **Be kind to yourself** - Don't get mad at yourself for missing days\n2. **Start small again** - Do a shorter workout to get back into it\n3. **Remember why you started** - Think about how good exercise makes you feel\n4. **Adjust your plan** - Maybe you need a different time of day or activity\n\n**Remember:** Missing a few days doesn't erase your progress!\n\n## Over to You\n\nNow it's your turn to create a motivation plan:\n\n1. List three physical activities you enjoy\n2. Choose one small activity to do this week\n3. Decide when and where you'll do it\n4. Think about who could support you\n5. Plan how you'll track your progress\n\n## Check Your Understanding\n\nAnswer these questions to see what you've learnt:\n\n1. What's the difference between internal and external motivation?\n2. Why is it better to start with small amounts of exercise?\n3. Name two ways you could track your exercise progress at home.\n4. What should you do if you miss several days of exercise?\n5. How can family members help you stay motivated?\n\n## Keep Learning\n\nWant to learn more about staying motivated? Try these resources:\n- Kid-friendly workout videos on YouTube\n- Free fitness apps for beginners\n- Online communities for young athletes\n\nRemember: The most important thing is finding activities you enjoy!\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
