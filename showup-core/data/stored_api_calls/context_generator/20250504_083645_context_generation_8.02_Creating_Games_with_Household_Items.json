Through fun activities and self-practice, you'll learn practical skills to use in PE class and everyday situations like before tests or when feeling overwhelmed. These techniques build on what you've learnt about adapting games by showing how physical activities can include mindfulness.\n\n## Materials\n- Small open space at home\n- Optional: Pillow, blanket, or towel\n- Watch or phone timer\n- Printed breathing guide or device to view instructions\n\n## Belly Breathing \n1. Find a comfortable position (sitting or lying down).\n2. Belly breathing works like this: \"Place one hand on your belly and one on your chest. When you breathe in through your nose, make your belly rise like a balloon filling with air. When you breathe out through your mouth, feel your belly sink back down.\"\n3. Practice for as long as feels comfortable, starting with 1 minute.\n4. Self-challenge: Count your breaths for 30 seconds. Then try again and see if you can slow down your breathing with each attempt.\n5. Reflection: Notice how your body feels different after breathing this way. Does it feel more relaxed or energized?\n\n## Box Breathing\n1. Box breathing uses a square shape drawn in the air: \"Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, breathe out for 4 counts, and hold for 4 counts.\"\n2. Practice by yourself, using your finger to trace the four sides of an imaginary \"box\" in front of you.\n3. Solo variation: Hold a small soft object like a stuffed animal or pillow while doing box breathing, squeezing gently during each \"hold\" phase.\n4. Think about: \"When might this technique be helpful in your daily life?\" Maybe before a test or when feeling nervous?\n\n## Body Scan \n1. A body scan helps you check in with different parts of your body to notice if they feel tense or relaxed.\n2. Start with toes and move upward: \"Wiggle your toes, then let them relax. Tighten your calf muscles, then release.\"\n3. Continue through major muscle groups to the head at your own pace.\n4. Superhero pose activity: \"Stand tall like your favourite superhero, tensing all your muscles, then 'melt' like ice cream, relaxing completely.\"\n5. Notice: \"Where did you feel the most tension in your body? How did it feel to release it?\" You might want to write this down in a notebook.\n\n## Mindful Movement\n1. Connect breath with simple movements:\n   - Reach arms up while breathing in, lower while breathing out\n   - Gentle side bends coordinated with breath\n   - Slow walking with breath awareness\n2. Create your own simple sequence of 4 movements.\n3. Individual challenge: Design your own short \"mindful movement routine\" that includes at least 3 movements coordinated with breath.\n4. Practice: Perform your routine 2-3 times, making adjustments until it feels right for you.\n\n## Over to You \n1. Self-reflection: Think about when these techniques could help you during your day.\n2. Personal plan: Choose one technique you liked best and pick a specific time you'll practice it tomorrow.\n3. Write it down: In a notebook or on your phone, record when and where you'll practice your chosen technique.\n4. Remember: \"These skills are like muscles - the more you practice, the stronger they get!\"\n\n## Assessment\nTake a moment to think about which techniques felt most helpful to you. Consider how well you were able to follow the breathing patterns and whether you noticed any changes in how you felt. Your personal plan for using these techniques is an important way to make these skills part of your daily routine.\n\n## Conclusion\nThese mindfulness practices connect to our previous lessons on adapting games. Today we adapted movement to include mindfulness. Next time, we'll explore how to design inclusive games that everyone can enjoy. The breathing and body awareness skills you've learnt today can help you stay focused and calm during any physical activity!\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
