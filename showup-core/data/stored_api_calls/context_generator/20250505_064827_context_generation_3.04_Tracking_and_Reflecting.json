Your cardio log shows what exercises from your circuit make you feel great and which ones might need adjustments. These records help you make smarter choices about staying active and building healthy habits that stick. The skills you learn from tracking your exercise will be super helpful in other parts of your life too!\n\n<br/>\nYou'll need:\n\n- A cardio log worksheet (you can print this from your course materials)\n- A pencil or pen\n- A timer or stopwatch (your phone timer works great too!)\n- Comfy clothes you can move around in\n- Your completed cardio circuit from Lesson 3.3\n\n## Let's Begin!\n\n### Step 1: Getting to Know Your Cardio Log \nYour cardio log is like a fitness diary where you'll write down:\n\n- Which cardio circuit you completed (the one you designed in Lesson 3.3)\n- How many rounds you completed\n- How long you exercised (in minutes)\n- How hard it felt (on a scale where 1=super easy and 5=really tough!)\n- How your body and mind felt during and after (energized? tired? happy?)\n\nTake a quick look at your cardio log worksheet. Can you find all the different boxes where you'll record this information? Check out the example in your materials to see what a filled-out log looks like.\n\n### Step 2: Time to Try Your Cardio Circuit! \nRemember the cardio circuit you created in our last lesson? Now it's time to put it into action! Get your circuit plan ready and follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the warm-up we learned (arm circles, knee hugs, torso twists, and slow jumping jacks)\n2. Set your timer for the exercise and rest periods you planned\n3. Complete your circuit following the structure you designed\n4. Try to complete the number of rounds you planned in your circuit\n\nWhile you're moving through your circuit, pay attention to how your body feels - notice your heartbeat getting faster, your breathing changing, and which muscles are working hard. Some activities in your circuit might feel easier for you than others - that's totally normal!\n\n### Step 3: Write It Down\nRight after you finish your circuit, grab your cardio log and fill it out while everything is fresh in your mind. Be honest about how the workout felt - this is just for you to learn about yourself, not to impress anyone!\n\n### Step 4: Think About Your Circuit Workout\nNow that you've finished, take a moment to think about your experience and answer these questions in your notebook:\n\n- Which activities in your circuit did you have the most fun doing? Why?\n- Which activities made you work the hardest?\n- How did your body feel during different exercises in your circuit? (Was your heart racing? Were your muscles burning?)\n- How do you feel now that you're done? (Energized? Tired? Proud?)\n- What might you change about your circuit the next time you exercise?\n\n### Step 5: Create Your Own Fitness Goal \nNow that you've tried your cardio circuit, let's create a fitness goal just for you. A great goal follows the SMART format:\n\n- **S**pecific: Exactly what you want to do with your cardio circuit\n- **M**easurable: How you'll know when you've done it\n- **A**chievable: Something you can actually do (be realistic!)\n- **R**elevant: Something that matters to you\n- **T**ime-bound: When you plan to finish it\n\nFor example: \"I will complete my cardio circuit three times a week for the next two weeks, adding one extra round each week.\"\n\n<br/>\nWrite your goal in your cardio log. If you can, tell a family member about your goal - sharing it with someone else makes it more likely you'll stick with it!\n\n## Wrap-Up\nToday you learned how to be your own fitness coach by tracking and thinking about your cardio circuit activities. Your cardio log is like a fitness map that helps you see what's working in your circuit, set good goals, and adjust your exercise routine to get healthier. This way of paying attention to your body helps you build exercise habits that last a long time.\n\n<br/>\nAs we continue our fitness journey, we'll explore different muscle groups and how they work together when you exercise. The tracking skills you're learning now will connect with our upcoming lessons on strength and flexibility.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Tracking your cardio circuit workouts helps you identify patterns and make better exercise choices that lead to lasting healthy habits.\n- Creating SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) for your cardio circuit gives your fitness journey clear direction and increases your chances of success.\n- Paying attention to how your body feels during and after your circuit provides valuable feedback to guide your future workout decisions.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n</CONTENT>\n",
