Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nReview all markdown headings (indicated with #, ##, etc.) in the provided content with the expertise of a professional educational line editor from the publishing industry. Your edits must be informed by the target learner profile to ensure appropriate vocabulary and complexity level.\n\nDO NOT EDIT the following headings under ANY circumstances:\n- \"## Learning Objectives\"\n- Any heading starting with \"## Lesson Podcast Discussion:\"\n- \"## Key Takeaways\"\n- Any heading that follows a numbering pattern like \"# 7.1\" (Note: The heading after a numbering like \"# 7.1\" must always remain an H1 heading)\n\nCRITICAL HEADING STRUCTURE RULES:\n1. ALL main section headings after \"## Learning Objectives\" must use H2 (##) level, NOT H3 (###)\n2. Subsections should use H3 (###) only if they are nested under an H2 section\n3. After an H1 section title, the document must proceed to H2 headings (not H3)\n4. Maintain a strict hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3 → H4 without skipping levels\n\nFor all other headings, apply these editorial principles:\n\n1. HIERARCHY & CONSISTENCY: Maintain a logical, consistent heading structure throughout:\n   - H1 (#) only for the main title and numbered section identifiers\n   - H2 (##) for all major sections\n   - H3 (###) only for subsections within H2 sections\n   - H4 (####) only for subsections within H3 sections\n\n2. PARALLELISM: Maintain consistent grammatical structure across headings at the same level.\n\n3. CLARITY: Ensure each heading clearly communicates its content and purpose.\n\n4. CONCISENESS: Remove unnecessary words while preserving meaning.\n\n5. SPECIFICITY: Replace vague headings with precise, descriptive alternatives.\n\n6. ENGAGEMENT: Transform passive headings into active ones that intrigue readers.\n\n7. EDUCATIONAL VALUE: Ensure headings facilitate learning and information retention.\n\n8. SCANABILITY: Optimize headings for quick comprehension and navigation.\n\n9. ACCESSIBILITY: Use vocabulary appropriate for the target learner profile while maintaining subject matter precision.\n\n10. CONSISTENCY: Standardize capitalization, punctuation, and terminology across headings.\n\nFor each heading that requires modification, provide exact edit commands using the specified format. Make surgical edits only where necessary - don't change what already works well.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.
