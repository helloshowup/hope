Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

You're not alone! Many students struggle to find the perfect spot for working out at home. The good news is that you don't need a fancy gym or expensive equipment to get a great workout.\n\nIn previous lessons, you've learned about exercise safety, body awareness, and different types of workouts. Now it's time to put that knowledge into action by creating your own personal fitness space that works for YOUR home and YOUR needs.\n\nThis lesson will show you how to transform almost any area—from a tiny bedroom corner to a shared living room—into an effective workout zone. With a little creativity, you'll soon have a space that makes you excited to exercise!\n\n## Elements of a Safe Home Fitness Space \nA safe home fitness space needs a few key elements to help prevent injuries and make your workouts more effective. Think of your fitness space like a driver's seat in a car—you need to adjust it properly before you start moving!\n\n**The Safety Checklist:**\n- **Clear area:** Remove furniture, toys, backpacks, and other tripping hazards\n- **Adequate space:** Create at least a 6 feet by 6 feet area (about the size of a bathroom)\n- **Non-slip surface:** Ensure the floor is dry and not slippery\n- **Proper gear:** Wear supportive athletic shoes with good traction (no socks only or bare feet!)\n- **Hydration station:** Keep a water bottle nearby for regular sips\n- **Comfortable clothing:** Wear clothes that allow free movement\n- **Support surface:** Use a yoga mat, folded blanket, or beach towel for floor exercises\n\nA good fitness space is like your own personal safety bubble. Just as you wouldn't drive a car without buckling your seatbelt, you shouldn't exercise in a cluttered or unsafe area.\n\nFor example, Jamal created his fitness space by moving his beanbag chair to one side of his bedroom and rolling up a small rug that kept sliding. He placed a water bottle on his nightstand and used a beach towel for floor exercises. This simple setup took less than 5 minutes but made his workouts much safer and more enjoyable.\n\n## Creative Solutions for Common Space Challenges\nEven in the smallest homes, you can find ways to create an effective workout space. The key is to get creative and adapt to what you have available. Think of it like playing Tetris—finding the right way to fit exercise into your living space!\n\n**Challenge: Very Limited Space**\n- Focus on stationary exercises that don't require movement (like planks, push-ups, or squats)\n- Use a hallway for directional movements or walking in place\n- Exercise in shifts: do upper body exercises in one position, then rearrange for lower body\n- Try \"zone training\": designate different spots in your home for different exercises\n\n**Challenge: Shared Living Spaces**\n- Schedule workout time when fewer people are around\n- Create a portable \"workout kit\" in a box or bag that you can quickly set up and put away\n- Use visual boundaries like a small rug to define your exercise area\n- Involve family members in your workout (turn it into a group activity!)\n\n**Challenge: Noise Concerns**\n- Use headphones for workout videos\n- Create a visual exercise chart or cards instead of audio instructions\n- Choose low-impact exercises (no jumping) during quiet hours\n- Use hand signals instead of verbal cues if following along with family members\n\nFor example, Lin lives in a small apartment with her family. She created a \"fitness corner\" by placing a yoga mat behind the couch in the living room. When it's time to exercise, she simply moves one small coffee table. After her workout, she rolls up her mat and stores it with her resistance bands in a decorative basket.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert an \"Audio Instructions\" section within the markers ---audioinstructions--- and ---audioinstructionsEND---. Create this based on the content that follows this instruction block. The section should include a heading \"#### Audio Instructions: \" followed by a brief title that describes the key action or concept being explained (e.g., \"How to Skip\" should be replaced with an appropriate title based on the following content). Then include a URL in this format: https://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/X-X-Y.mp3 where X-X should match the lesson number found at the top of the document (e.g., \"2.1\" would become \"2-1\"), and Y should be a sequential number starting with 1 for the first audio instruction in the file, 2 for the second, etc. Place this section at the appropriate point in the content where audio guidance would be most helpful.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.What is the biggest challenge you face when trying to exercise at home? (Is it limited space, shared rooms, noise concerns, or something else? Look around your home. What is one spot that could potentially work as a fitness space with some small adjustments? What would you need to move or change? ] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nRemember, there's no \"perfect\" fitness space—just the one that works best for you and your situation. Even professional athletes sometimes have to get creative when they can't access their usual training facilities!\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content. Insert this section after all main content and any activities/assessments, typically at the document end.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
