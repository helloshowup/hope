Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

Maybe homework piles up, rain ruins outdoor plans, or you just don't feel like moving. These challenges happen to everyone! Today, we'll look at common obstacles and discover practical ways to get past them.\n\n<br/>\nSpotting and solving these exercise problems is a skill you'll use your whole life. Now that we understand how to track our progress, let's focus on keeping active even when things don't go as planned.\n\n## Materials Needed\n\n- Notebook or paper and pencil\n- A small clear space (about the size of a yoga mat)\n- A timer (phone timer works great)\n- Optional: water bottle or canned food item for makeshift weights\n\n## Common Barriers to Physical Activity \n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] Here are some typical obstacles that might keep you from being active: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n<br/>\n1. **Limited Time Due to Homework**: School, homework, and other activities can fill up your day quickly.\n\n<br/>\n2. **Lack of Equipment**: You might not have sports gear, gym access, or fitness equipment at home.\n\n<br/>\n3. **Limited Space**: A small bedroom or apartment can make it hard to find room to move.\n\n<br/>\n4. **Weather Restrictions**: Rain, extreme heat, or cold can make outdoor activities difficult.\n\n<br/>\n5. **Lack of Motivation**: Some days you just don't feel like moving - and that's okay!\n\n## Activity 1: Identifying Your Personal Barriers\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Find a quiet spot where you can focus for 5-10 minutes\n2. Open your notebook to a clean page and title it \"My Activity Barriers\"\n3. Create two columns: \"My Barriers\" and \"Specific Examples\"\n\n**What To Do:**\n1. List 2-3 specific barriers that personally affect you\n2. For each barrier, write a specific example of how it impacts you\n3. Rate each barrier from 1-5 (1 = minor obstacle, 5 = major obstacle)\n\n**Example of Completed Activity:**\n```\nMY ACTIVITY BARRIERS\nMy Barriers | Specific Examples | Rating\n\n--------------------------------|-------\nLimited Time | Math homework takes 1 hour every night | 4\nWeather | Can't use my bike when it rains (2x per week) | 3\nSmall Bedroom | Only have a 4x6 foot clear space to move | 2\n```\n\n**Success Check:** You've completed this activity successfully if you have:\n- Listed at least 2 specific barriers\n- Included real examples from your life (not general statements)\n- Rated each barrier to show which ones affect you most\n\n## Overcoming Barriers: Practical Solutions\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] Now let's tackle these challenges with specific solutions you can try at home: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n\n### 1. For Limited Time:\n\n**Quick Solutions:**\n- **Time-Chunking Method**: Do three separate 5-minute activity breaks instead of one 15-minute session\n  - Morning: 5 minutes of stretching after waking up\n  - After school: 5 minutes of jumping jacks or high knees\n  - Evening: 5 minutes of dancing to favorite songs\n\n- **Homework Movement Breaks**: Set a timer to stand up and move for 2 minutes after every 20 minutes of homework\n  \n- **Multitasking Options**:\n  - Do calf raises while brushing teeth\n  - Practice balance exercises while waiting for microwave\n  - Stretch arms and shoulders while watching videos\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you forget your movement breaks, set alarms on your phone\n- If you're too tired after school, try morning activity instead\n- If homework takes too long, use the Pomodoro technique (20 min work/2 min movement)\n\n### 2. For Lack of Equipment:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n**Household Item Alternatives:**\n- **Water Bottle Weights**: Fill water bottles for different weights\n  - Small bottle (8 oz) = light weight\n  - Large bottle (20 oz) = medium weight\n  - Gallon jug with handle = heavy weight\n\n- **DIY Step Platform**: Use a sturdy stair step or a thick hardcover book that doesn't slide\n\n- **Makeshift Balance Beam**: Place a piece of tape on the floor in a straight line\n\n- **No-Equipment Workout Circuit**: Complete 30 seconds of each:\n  - Jumping jacks\n  - Wall push-ups\n  - Chair squats (squat to touch a chair seat, then stand)\n  - Plank hold\n  - Rest 1 minute, then repeat 2-3 times\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If water bottles leak, use canned food items instead\n- If you don't have space for jumping jacks, try marching in place\n- If a movement hurts, modify it to be smaller or slower\n\n### 3. For Limited Space:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n**Small-Space Workout Station:**\n1. Clear a space the size of a yoga mat (about 2 feet by 6 feet)\n2. Mark the corners with small objects to remind you of your workout zone\n3. Try these space-efficient exercises:\n\n- Planks (regular, side, or modified on knees)\n- Lunges in place (forward, backward, or side)\n- Chair dips using a sturdy chair or bed edge\n- Wall sits (back against wall, knees bent at 90°)\n- Standing core twists\n\n**Vertical Space Workout:**\n- Use a wall for wall push-ups, wall sits, and stretches\n- Practice balance by standing on one foot while touching the wall for support\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If floor is hard, use a folded blanket or towel\n- If ceiling is low, choose exercises that keep you close to the ground\n- If noise bothers family members/neighbors, focus on slow, controlled movements\n\n### 4. For Weather Restrictions:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n**Indoor Activity Options:**\n- **Hallway Activities**: \n  - Hallway bowling with water bottles and soft ball\n  - Hallway hopscotch with paper squares\n  - Walking lunges from one end to the other\n\n- **Room-Based Circuit**: Create stations in different parts of your home:\n  - Bedroom: 10 sit-ups\n  - Bathroom doorway: 10 doorway stretches\n  - Living room: 10 couch step-ups\n  - Kitchen: 10 counter push-ups\n\n- **Rainy Day Movement Menu**: Choose 3-5 activities from this list:\n  - Dance to 3 favorite songs\n  - Follow a 10-minute online workout video\n  - Do a cleaning sprint (set timer for 5 minutes of fast cleaning)\n  - Create an indoor obstacle course\n  - Do stair repeats (up and down) for 5 minutes\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you're concerned about noise, use a yoga mat or towel to muffle footsteps\n- If space is shared, schedule your activity time when others are busy\n- If you get bored easily, change activities every 5 minutes\n\n### 5. For Lack of Motivation:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n**Motivation Boosters:**\n- **5-Minute Rule**: Commit to just 5 minutes of activity - once started, you'll often continue longer\n- **Activity Jar**: Write 15-20 quick activities on paper slips (10 jumping jacks, 30-second plank, etc.). When unmotivated, pull one slip and do just that activity\n- **Reward System**: Create a chart with boxes to check off each time you complete an activity. After 5 checks, give yourself a small reward\n\n**Visual Tracking Tool:**\n1. Draw a simple calendar for the week\n2. Each day you do any physical activity, color the box or add a sticker\n3. Aim to avoid having two blank days in a row\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you're feeling too tired, try a gentle stretching routine instead of skipping completely\n- If you're bored with your usual activities, try something completely different\n- If you keep forgetting, pair activity with something you already do daily (like brushing teeth)\n\n## Activity 2: Solution Matching Workshop\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Create a new page in your notebook titled \"My Barrier Solutions\"\n2. Draw a line down the middle to create two columns\n3. Label the columns \"My Top Barrier\" and \"My Solutions\"\n\n**What To Do:**\n1. Choose your highest-rated barrier from Activity 1\n2. In the first column, describe this barrier in detail\n3. In the second column, write at least 3 specific solutions from the sections above that could help you overcome this barrier\n4. For each solution, add any modifications needed to make it work in your situation\n5. Circle the solution you will try first\n\n**Example of Completed Activity:**\n```\nMY BARRIER SOLUTIONS\nMy Top Barrier | My Solutions\n\n--------------------------------\nLimited space in my bedroom - | 1.

  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module focused on overcoming common barriers to physical activity. It covers key learning objectives, provides examples of typical obstacles, and outlines practical solutions and strategies for maintaining an active lifestyle despite challenges. The content is structured with clear headings, instructions for hands-on activities, and opportunities for self-reflection.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt calls for processing the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted content generation instruction blocks, and generating new content that precisely fulfills the specified requirements. The generated content must seamlessly integrate with the surrounding text while preserving all special marker tags.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is middle school students (ages 11-14) enrolled in an asynchronous online physical education course. Key considerations for this learner profile include:\n\n- Reading level at 5th-6th grade, using everyday language and short sentences\n- Preference for visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities\n- Limited access to specialized fitness equipment, requiring alternatives using common household items\n- Need for adaptations to small living spaces and consideration of noise/disruption in shared environments\n- Inclusion of safety guidelines, warm-up/cool-down instructions, and modifications for different physical abilities\n\nThe content should maintain a friendly, conversational tone and connect to real-world examples familiar to this age group.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nAs this content is designed for an asynchronous online learning environment, there are a few key limitations to keep in mind:\n\n- No opportunities for peer interaction or instructor feedback\n- Reliance on self-directed learning and intrinsic motivation\n- Need for clear, step-by-step instructions and visual aids\n- Importance of engaging formatting and layout to sustain attention\n\nThe content should be structured in easily digestible \"chunks\" with frequent headings, bullet points, and visual breaks to accommodate this learning medium.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core educational objectives and practical problem-solving approach\n- Maintain the document's instructional tone and consistent formatting patterns\n- Adapt language, examples, and complexity to align with the target learner profile\n- Incorporate more transitional paragraphs to create natural flow between sections\n- Ensure all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, etc.) remain intact\n\n## Suggested Approach\nWhen generating new content to replace the instruction blocks, focus on:\n\n1. Thoroughly analyzing the requested specifications to understand the intent\n2. Crafting concise, well-structured paragraphs that seamlessly integrate with the surrounding text\n3. Using simple, accessible language and familiar examples to explain concepts\n4. Incorporating visual elements (images, diagrams, illustrations) to support understanding\n5. Providing clear, actionable guidance that aligns with the target learner's needs and limitations\n6. Preserving the document's instructional tone and formatting patterns\n7. Ensuring all special marker tags are left completely intact\n\nThe goal is to enhance the educational value of the content while maintaining its core purpose and structure. Pay close attention to the target learner profile and learning medium considerations to optimize the content for the intended audience."
