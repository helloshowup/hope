Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

Knowing how to find and fix these issues is an important skill for anyone working with robots.\n\nRobot systems can fail in many ways, but some problems happen more often than others. Connection problems are very common - loose wires, disconnected sensors, or bad connections between parts can make a robot act strangely or not work at all.\n\nPower issues also cause lots of problems. Batteries might be low or dead, power switches might be off, or there might be a short circuit somewhere in the system. These issues often mean a robot won't turn on, suddenly shuts down, or works sometimes but not always.\n\nMistakes in the programming can make robots behave in weird ways. A small error in the code might make a robot move in the wrong direction, ignore its sensors, or get stuck doing the same action over and over. You might notice your robot follows some commands but not others, or does things in the wrong order.\n\n## **Diagnostic Approaches**\n\nGood troubleshooting starts with watching carefully. What exactly is the robot doing or not doing? When did the problem start? Does it happen all the time or just sometimes?\n\nAfter watching, it's best to follow a step-by-step approach. This often means using a decision tree - a series of questions that helps narrow down what might be causing the problem. For example, if a robot won't move, you might first check if it's turned on, then check if the motors are connected, then test if each motor works by itself, and so on.\n\nTesting one part at a time is another great way to find problems. This is called isolation testing. For instance, if you think a sensor isn't working, you could write a simple program that just reads and shows that sensor's values to see if it's working right.\n\n## **Systematic Problem Solving**\n\nWhen your robot has a problem, follow these steps to find and fix it:\n\n1. Define the problem clearly - What should the robot be doing? What is it actually doing?\n2. Check the obvious - Is it turned on? Are batteries charged? Can you see any disconnected wires?\n3. Divide and conquer - Test each part separately (sensors, motors, brain, power) to find what's not working.\n4. Change one thing at a time - If you fix multiple things at once, you won't know which fix actually solved the problem.\n5. Write down what you try - Keep track of what you've tested so you don't repeat steps.\n\nHere's an example: If your line-following robot keeps losing the line, you might first check if the line sensor is in the right position, then test if the sensor can actually see the line, then check if the motors respond to commands, and finally look at your code to make sure it's correctly using the sensor information.\n\nLet's look at a real example: Imagine you built a robot that's supposed to follow a line on the floor, but it keeps spinning in circles instead. Here's how you might solve it:\n\n1. Define the problem: Robot should follow a line but spins in circles instead\n2. Check the obvious: Batteries are charged, robot is turned on, line is easy to see\n3. Divide and conquer: Test each sensor by putting it over the line and seeing if it detects light changes\n4. You discover one sensor always reads \"dark\" no matter what it's looking at\n5. Fix the sensor connection and test again - now the robot follows the line correctly!\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nA robot is not responding to touch sensor input. Which troubleshooting step would be MOST logical to try first?\n\nA. Immediately replace the robot's processing unit\n\nB. Check the physical connection between the sensor and the controller\n\nC. Reprogram the entire robot with new software\n\nD. Increase the power supply to all systems\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Check the physical connection between the sensor and the controller. When troubleshooting, it's best to start with the simplest and most common causes before moving to more complex or expensive solutions. Checking physical connections is a quick, non-destructive first step that addresses a frequent issue. If you chose a different answer, remember that troubleshooting should progress from simple to complex solutions, checking each component methodically.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robot problems usually come from loose wires, dead batteries, or code mistakes - each showing different symptoms you can learn to spot.\n- Successful troubleshooters carefully observe the problem, then test one part at a time to find what's broken.\n- Follow five simple steps when fixing robots: identify the problem, check obvious things first, test each part, change one thing at a time, and track what you've tried.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n## **Activity 2: Troubleshooting Scenarios**\n\nWork through the provided troubleshooting scenarios where robot systems are exhibiting various malfunctions. For each scenario, apply the systematic troubleshooting approach learned in this lesson to identify the most likely cause of the problem. Document your reasoning process and the steps you would take to diagnose and resolve each issue, explaining which components you would check first and why.\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
