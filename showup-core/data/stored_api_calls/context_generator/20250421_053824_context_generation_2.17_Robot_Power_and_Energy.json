Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

Each of these robots needs power to work, but they get their power in very different ways! In this podcast, we explore how robots are powered and why the right power source matters so much.\n\nJust like you need food for energy, robots need power to move, think, and do their jobs. Some robots plug into the wall, others use batteries like your toys, and some cool robots even use solar panels like calculators! The way a robot gets its power affects where it can go, how long it can work, and what jobs it can do. A robot vacuum with a small battery might only clean for an hour, while a factory robot plugged into the wall can work all day and night.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we'll look at real robots and see how engineers choose the best power source for each job. We'll also look into the future to see exciting new ways robots might be powered, like using hydrogen fuel cells or even getting energy from their surroundings!\n\n## Robot Power Fundamentals\n\nRobots need power to work, just like humans need food for energy. Power in robotics means the electrical energy that makes everything work - from the computer \"brain\" to the motors that help robots move. Understanding how robots use power helps us build better, more efficient machines.\n\n### **Energy Requirements in Robots**\n\nDifferent robots need different amounts of power, depending on what they do. A small robot toy might only need a little power from small batteries, while a large industrial robot that lifts heavy objects needs much more power.\n\nSeveral things affect how much energy a robot uses. The robot's size matters - bigger robots usually need more power. What the robot does is also important - moving around, lifting things, and processing information all need different amounts of energy. For example, a robot arm that lifts heavy boxes in a warehouse uses more power than a small robot that just follows lines on the floor.\n\nEngineers figure out a robot's power needs by adding up how much electricity each part needs. Motors that move the robot often need the most power, while sensors that help the robot \"see\" or \"feel\" might need very little. By understanding these needs, engineers can pick the right power source and make sure the robot has enough energy to do its job.\n\n### **Power Distribution Systems**\n\nOnce a robot has a power source, the electricity needs to get to all its different parts. This happens through the power distribution system, which works like the electrical wiring in your home.\n\nMost robots have a main power bus, which is like a highway for electricity that connects to all parts of the robot. Different parts in a robot often need different voltage levels - sensors might need 5 volts, while motors might need 12 volts or more. Voltage regulators help change the main power to the right levels for each part, similar to how adapters work for different devices in your home.\n\nSome robots have systems that decide which parts get power first when energy is limited. For example, a robot might reduce power to less important systems like displays when its battery is low, but keep important systems like its computer running. This is similar to how your phone might dim the screen when the battery is low to save power.\n\n### **Energy Consumption Patterns**\n\nRobots use different amounts of power at different times. Understanding these patterns helps engineers design better power systems.\n\nDuring operation, robots often have peak power demands - times when they need a lot of energy all at once. This might happen when a robot starts moving or lifts something heavy. Between these peaks, robots usually use less power during normal operation. When robots aren't actively working, they might go into standby mode, using very little power while waiting for the next task.\n\nMany robots go through operational cycles - repeated patterns of activity. For example, a robot vacuum might use more power when it's cleaning carpet than when it's on hard floors. It might use even more power when it needs to climb over a bump between rooms. By studying these patterns, engineers can design power systems that handle peak demands while being efficient during normal operation.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots use different power sources (batteries, wall plugs, or solar panels) based on their function, with each power source affecting where robots can go and how long they can work.\n- A robot's size and tasks determine how much energy it needs - larger robots or those doing heavy lifting require more power than smaller robots with simpler tasks.\n- Robots distribute electricity through power systems similar to home wiring, with different components often needing different voltage levels to function properly.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n## **Activity 1: Power Source Comparison Chart**\n\nCreate a detailed chart comparing different power sources for robots (various battery types, direct connection, solar, etc.) with their advantages, limitations, and best applications. Consider factors like energy density, recharge capability, weight, cost, and environmental impact. This activity will help you understand how power source selection directly impacts a robot's capabilities and suitable applications.\n</CONTENT>\n",
