Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Physical Education Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon;

No problem! You can bring your favorite outdoor games indoors with a few simple changes. By tweaking games to fit your bedroom or living room and using stuff you already have at home, you'll stay active and have fun regardless of the weather. Plus, these indoor versions help you get better at aiming, focusing, and coordinating your movements—skills that come in handy for sports and everyday activities.\n\n## Principles of Game Modification\n\nBefore we dive into specific games, let's talk about how to transform your favorite outdoor activities into indoor fun. Think about the last time you couldn't play outside because of bad weather - frustrating, right? With a few smart adjustments, you can bring that same excitement indoors without driving your parents crazy or breaking anything valuable. The trick is to look at what makes the outdoor game work, then find creative ways to make it fit your indoor space using everyday items you already have at home.\n\nStuck inside on a rainy day? No problem! You can bring your favorite outdoor games indoors with a few simple changes.

Plus, these indoor versions help you get better at aiming, focusing, and coordinating your movements—skills that come in handy for sports and everyday activities.\n\n## Principles of Game Modification\nWhen adapting games for indoor play, consider these three key factors:\n\n1. **Space**: Indoor areas are smaller than outdoor fields or courts. You'll need to shrink the playing area to fit inside a bedroom, hallway, or living room.\n\n2. **Equipment**: Rather than using standard sports equipment, opt for softer, lighter alternatives that won't damage anything indoors. Rolled-up socks make brilliant substitutes for balls!\n\n3. **Rules**: Adjust the rules to suit a smaller space with different equipment. This might mean simpler scoring or creative new ways to play by yourself.\n\nThese three adjustments can turn almost any outdoor game into something you can play inside!\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience.

Place your \"basket\" against a wall or in a corner\n2. Use tape to mark shooting lines at different distances\n3. Shoot from each line, trying to improve your accuracy\n4. Score 1 point for close shots, 2 points for medium distance, and 3 points for far shots\n5. Try to beat your own score each time you play!\n\n**Skills you'll develop:** Shooting accuracy, judging distance, focus\n\n### Hallway Bowling\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing.

Set up your \"pins\" at one end of a hallway or clear space\n2. Mark a rolling line with tape about 3-5 metres away\n3. Roll your ball toward the pins, trying to knock down as many as possible\n4. Give yourself two rolls per turn\n5. Keep track of how many pins you knock down in each frame\n6. Play 10 frames like in regular bowling and try to beat your previous score\n\n**Skills you'll develop:** Rolling accuracy, control of force, aiming\n\n### Sock Volleyball\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n**What you'll need:**\n- A rolled-up pair of socks or soft, lightweight ball\n- String, yarn, or masking tape for a \"net\"\n- Chairs or other furniture to support the net (if using string/yarn)\n\n**How to play:**\n1. Create a net by stretching string between two chairs or making a line on the floor with tape\n2. Stand on one side of the net\n3. Toss the sock ball up and hit it over the net\n4. Quickly run to the other side to return the ball\n5. See how many times you can hit the ball back and forth over the net without missing\n6. Try to beat your record each time you play\n\n**Skills you'll develop:** Hand-eye coordination, reaction time, agility\n\n## Benefits of Adapting Games for Indoor Play\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing.
