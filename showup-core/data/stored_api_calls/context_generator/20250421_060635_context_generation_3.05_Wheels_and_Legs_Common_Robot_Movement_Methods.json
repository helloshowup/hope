Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

Should it roll on wheels like a remote-control car, or walk on legs like a dog? This is one of the most important decisions robot designers make. Wheeled robots are usually simpler to build and control. They move smoothly and quickly on flat surfaces like floors and sidewalks. Think about how easily your bike or skateboard rolls on a smooth path! However, wheels struggle with stairs, rocky terrain, or gaps in the ground.\n\nLegged robots, on the other hand, can step over obstacles, climb stairs, and handle rough terrain much better. Just like how you can easily walk up stairs that a bicycle can't climb. The downside? Legs require more complex programming and mechanics to keep the robot balanced and moving properly. It's like the difference between riding a bike (which is pretty easy once you learn) and walking on stilts (which takes a lot more balance and coordination).\n\nWhen engineers choose between wheels and legs, they think about where the robot will work, what it needs to do, and how much complexity they can handle in their design. There's no one-size-fits-all answer - each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses!\n\n## **Wheeled Robot Designs**\n\n### **Two-Wheel Configurations**\n\nTwo-wheeled robots are among the simplest designs but offer surprising versatility. The most common type uses a **differential drive** system, where two powered wheels are placed on either side of the robot. By spinning these wheels at different speeds or in different directions, the robot can move forward, backward, or turn in place. Think about how a tank or wheelchair moves - that's differential drive in action!\n\nSome two-wheeled robots, like the famous Segway, use a **self-balancing** design. These robots position their wheels side by side and use sensors and motors to constantly adjust and stay upright, similar to how you balance a broom on your palm. This design creates a naturally nimble robot that can turn quickly and navigate tight spaces.\n\nTwo-wheeled robots are popular for beginner projects, educational platforms, and indoor robots because they're simple to build and program. For example, the Sphero BOLT educational robot uses two wheels inside a spherical shell to roll around classrooms while teaching students coding. Delivery robots like Starship Technologies' small food delivery bots use a similar two-wheel design to navigate college campuses and neighborhoods, using sensors to detect and avoid obstacles as they travel.\n\n### **Four-Wheel and Track Designs**\n\nFour-wheeled robots offer excellent stability and are often arranged like a car, with steering in the front wheels and power in the rear wheels. This arrangement, called **Ackermann steering**, allows for smooth turning at higher speeds but requires more space to turn compared to differential drive systems.\n\nAnother common four-wheel design is **skid steering**, where all four wheels are powered but don't turn independently. Instead, like in differential drive, the robot turns by running wheels on one side faster than the other. This creates a skidding motion during turns (hence the name) but makes for a sturdy, reliable design with fewer moving parts.\n\n**Track designs**, like those on tanks or bulldozers, wrap a continuous belt around wheels to increase the contact area with the ground. This gives excellent traction on soft surfaces like sand, snow, or mud where regular wheels might sink or slip. Military robots, construction robots, and exploration robots often use tracks to handle challenging terrain, though they use more energy and turn less efficiently than wheeled designs.\n\nIn the real world, NASA's Mars rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance use a special six-wheel design with individually powered wheels that can rotate in place, allowing them to navigate the rocky Martian landscape. Meanwhile, robots like the TALON used by bomb squads feature track designs that can climb stairs and move over rough debris at disaster sites.\n\n### **Omnidirectional Wheels**\n\nImagine wheels that can roll forward like normal wheels but also slide sideways without resistance. That's what **omnidirectional wheels** do! These special wheels come in several designs, including **Mecanum wheels** (which look like regular wheels with angled rollers around the edge) and **Swedish wheels** (with small rollers around the circumference).\n\nBy combining four of these special wheels and controlling each one independently, robots can move in any direction without needing to turn first. They can slide sideways, move diagonally, or even rotate while moving forward. This incredible flexibility makes omnidirectional wheels perfect for robots that need to navigate tight spaces or make precise movements.\n\nYou'll often find these wheels on indoor robots like automated factory vehicles, camera platforms for filming, and some advanced educational robots. For example, the FIRST Robotics Competition often features student-built robots with Mecanum wheels that can strafe sideways to align with game pieces. In hospitals, some medication delivery robots use omnidirectional wheels to navigate crowded hallways without needing wide turning spaces. While they're amazing for smooth, flat surfaces, they typically don't perform well on rough terrain and can be more complex to program and control.\n\n## **Activity 1: Wheel Arrangement Testing**\n\nUsing materials available to you (toy wheels, cardboard, etc.), create simple models of two different wheel arrangements discussed in this lesson. Test how each arrangement handles turning, moving forward, and traversing a small obstacle. Record your observations about stability and maneuverability differences between the arrangements.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Wheeled robots move faster and use less energy on smooth surfaces, while legged robots can climb stairs and handle rough terrain better.\n- The robot's job and working environment determine whether wheels or legs are better - wheels work best on flat surfaces while legs handle obstacles better.\n- Different wheel setups (like two-wheel differential drive, four-wheel designs, and omnidirectional wheels) each have unique advantages for stability, turning ability, and the types of surfaces they can handle.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
