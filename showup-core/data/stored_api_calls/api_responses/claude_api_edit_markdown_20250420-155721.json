When we see a robot move, we're witnessing its ability to change its position or the position of its parts to accomplish tasks. Think about it - without movement, many robots would simply be stationary computers!\n\nMovement gives robots the power to interact with the world around them. Whether it's a robot arm assembling a car part, a drone delivering a package, or a robot vacuum cleaning your home, movement is what allows these machines to be useful in our daily lives.\n\nThe ability to move is what transforms a simple computer into a machine that can physically change its environment. This is why movement is considered such a fundamental part of what makes many robots truly robotic.\n\n### **Why Robots Need to Move**\n\nRobots need to move for many different reasons, all connected to their specific jobs or purposes. Here are some of the main reasons:\n\nFirst, robots often need to move to complete tasks. A delivery robot must travel from one location to another. A manufacturing robot arm needs to reach, grab, and place objects. Even a simple educational robot like Sphero needs to roll around to draw shapes or navigate mazes.\n\nSecond, movement allows robots to explore and gather information about their surroundings. Mars rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance move across the Martian surface to study different areas and collect samples. Robot vacuums move around your home to find and clean dirty spots.\n\nThird, movement enables robots to adapt to changing environments. Search and rescue robots need to navigate through disaster areas that may be constantly changing. Agricultural robots must move through fields with varying terrain and plant growth.\n\n### **Moving vs. Non-Moving Robots**\n\nNot all robots need to move to be useful. Some robots are designed to stay in one place, while others need mobility to fulfill their purpose.\n\nStationary robots include industrial robot arms that are fixed to a specific spot on a factory floor. These robots can move their arms and tools with incredible precision, but the base of the robot remains in place. Other examples include automated teller machines (ATMs), which process banking transactions without needing to move locations, and some smart home devices like voice assistants.\n\nMoving robots, on the other hand, change their location to perform their tasks. Examples include self-driving cars, delivery drones, robot vacuums, and exploration robots. Their ability to navigate through space is essential to their function. A delivery robot that couldn't move would be useless for its intended purpose!\n\nThe choice between a moving or non-moving design depends entirely on what the robot needs to accomplish. A robot surgeon needs precise arm movements but doesn't need to travel around the hospital. A warehouse robot, however, must be able to travel throughout the facility to retrieve items.\n\n\n## **Activity 1: Robot Movement Classification**\nStudents sort images of various robots based on whether they move or not, then categorize moving robots by purpose and movement type. Consider how each robot's movement capability relates to its function and what would happen if that movement capability was removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Learning Objectives Insertion Engine for Markdown Content\n\n## System Role\nYou are an expert instructional designer specialized in making surgical edits to markdown educational content. Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets.
