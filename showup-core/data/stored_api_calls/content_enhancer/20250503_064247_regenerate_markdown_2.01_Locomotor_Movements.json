  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an introduction to five fundamental locomotor movements: walking, running, hopping, jumping, and skipping. It establishes the importance of these basic movement skills as building blocks for various sports and physical activities. The lesson includes demonstrations of proper technique for each movement, followed by a guided practice session for students to apply what they've learned.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Expand the bullet point descriptions for each locomotor movement demonstration to provide more detailed, step-by-step instructions tailored to the target learner.\n2. Incorporate more visual elements (e.g., images, diagrams) to support the explanations of proper technique.\n3. Adapt the language, examples, and complexity level to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level and learning preferences of the 11-14 year old target audience.\n4. Ensure the content is optimized for asynchronous online delivery, with clear structure, frequent visual breaks, and opportunities for active engagement.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use language and examples that are relatable and engaging for middle school students. Explanations should be concise, with step-by-step instructions and visual aids to support understanding. Adaptations for different physical abilities and home environments should be included to ensure accessibility.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no opportunities for peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained, with clear structure and visual elements to maintain student engagement and comprehension in the absence of an instructor or classmates.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose of introducing and demonstrating fundamental locomotor movements as the building blocks for various physical activities and sports.\n- Enhance the explanations of proper technique to be more detailed and tailored to the target learner's needs, while maintaining the original intent.\n- Incorporate more visual elements (images, diagrams) to support the explanations and make the content more engaging for the target audience.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity level to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level and learning preferences of 11-14 year old students.\n- Optimize the content structure and formatting for asynchronous online delivery, ensuring clear organization, frequent visual breaks, and opportunities for active engagement.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Expand the bullet point descriptions for each locomotor movement demonstration to provide step-by-step instructions that are clear, concise, and tailored to the target learner's needs. Use simple language, active voice, and relatable examples to explain the proper technique.\n2. Incorporate relevant images, diagrams, and illustrations to visually support the explanations of each locomotor movement. Ensure the visual elements are appropriately sized and placed within the text to enhance understanding.\n3. Review the content for readability and comprehension at the 5th-6th grade level. Simplify any overly complex language or jargon, and ensure the tone and style are engaging for the 11-14 year old target audience.\n4. Organize the content in a clear, structured manner with frequent headings, subheadings, and visual breaks to maintain student engagement and comprehension in the asynchronous online format.\n5. Consider adding \"Stop and Think\" moments or simple challenges that encourage the learners to actively apply what they've learned about the locomotor movements.\n6. Provide adaptations and alternatives for the locomotor movement activities to accommodate different physical abilities and home environments, ensuring the content is accessible and inclusive.",

These basic movements are the building blocks that make all sports and physical activities possible.\n\n## Locomotor Movement Demonstrations (10 minutes)\nLet's explore five basic locomotor movements. Watch closely as I demonstrate each one:\n\n1. **Walking**: Walking might seem super easy, but there's actually a right way to do it! \n\n   ![Proper walking technique](https://example.com/walking-technique.jpg)\n\n   **How to walk with good technique:**\n   * Stand tall with your head up and shoulders relaxed\n   * Start by placing your heel on the ground first, then roll to your toes (heel-to-toe)\n   * Keep your arms bent at about 90 degrees, swinging them naturally opposite to your legs\n   * Take steps that feel comfortable - not too big or too small\n   * Look ahead, not down at your feet\n   \n   Try walking across the room focusing on your posture. Notice how different it feels when you pay attention to your walking technique!\n\n2. **Running**: Running builds on walking but adds more speed and power. Good running technique helps you move faster while using less energy!\n\n   ![Proper running form](https://example.com/running-technique.jpg)\n\n   **How to run with good technique:**\n   * Keep your upper body straight but slightly leaned forward\n   * Lift your knees higher than when walking\n   * Land on the middle or front part of your foot, not your heel\n   * Bend your arms at about 90 degrees and pump them forward and back (not side to side)\n   * Keep your hands relaxed - imagine holding a potato chip without crushing it\n   * Breathe naturally through both your nose and mouth\n\n   When you run with good form, you'll be able to run longer distances without getting as tired!\n\n3. **Hopping**: Hopping is jumping and landing on the same foot. It's a great way to build strength and balance in each leg separately.\n\n   ![Hopping technique](https://example.com/hopping-technique.jpg)\n\n   **How to hop correctly:**\n   * Start standing on one foot with your knee slightly bent\n   * Swing your arms forward as you push off the ground\n   * Keep your eyes focused on one spot to help with balance\n   * Land softly on the ball of the same foot you jumped from, bending your knee to absorb the impact\n   * Use your arms to help keep your balance\n   * Practice on both your right and left foot - most people find one side easier than the other!\n\n   Try hopping in place 5 times on each foot. Which foot feels more comfortable to hop on?\n\n4. **Jumping**: Jumping uses both feet together to push off and land. It's used in many sports like basketball, volleyball, and track and field.\n\n   ![Jumping technique](https://example.com/jumping-technique.jpg)\n\n   **How to jump effectively:**\n   * Start with your feet shoulder-width apart\n   * Bend your knees and hips like you're sitting in a chair\n   * Swing your arms backward, then forward and upward as you jump\n   * Push off with both feet at the same time\n   * While in the air, keep your body straight and look forward\n   * Land softly on the balls of your feet with your knees bent to absorb the shock\n   * End with your arms forward for balance\n\n   Remember: the deeper you bend before jumping, the higher you can usually jump!\n\n5. **Skipping**: Skipping combines a step and a hop in a rhythmic pattern. It's fun and great for coordination!\n\n   ![Skipping technique](https://example.com/skipping-technique.jpg)\n\n   **How to skip:**\n   * Step forward with one foot\n   * Hop on that same foot while lifting your other knee up\n   * Then step forward with the other foot and hop on it\n   * Continue this step-hop pattern, alternating feet\n   * Use your arms naturally - they should swing in opposition to your legs\n   * Try to create a steady rhythm: step-hop, step-hop\n   * Keep your head up and maintain good posture\n\n   Skipping is used in many sports for warming up and improving coordination. It might take a little practice to get the rhythm right, but once you do, it's really fun!\n\n## Guided Practise (20 minutes)\nYour turn now! Let's split into small groups to practise each movement. I'll move around to offer tips on your technique.\n\nTry these challenges:\n- Move at different speeds - slow-mo, medium, and quick\n- Change directions - forwards, backwards, sideways\n- Follow the floor patterns\n- Sync your movements with the music\n\nRemember, quality matters more than speed!\n\n## Conclusion\nThe locomotor movements we've practised today will serve you throughout your life.
