  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures.

Understanding Non-Locomotor Movements\n\n**What are they?**\nNon-locomotor movements are physical actions you can do while staying in one spot. Think about how a tree sways in the wind without moving from its roots - that's similar to how your body can move in many ways without traveling anywhere. These movements are the building blocks for many physical activities and help you gain better control of your body.\n\n**Common examples include:**\n- Bending: Folding your body at joints like knees, waist, or elbows\n- Stretching: Extending your limbs to create length in your muscles\n- Twisting: Rotating your upper body while keeping your lower body still\n- Turning: Pivoting on your feet to face different directions\n- Pushing: Using force to move away from your body\n- Pulling: Using force to bring something toward your body\n\n**Why they matter:**\n- These movements build the foundation for sports, dance, and everyday activities\n- They help develop your muscle control and coordination\n- They improve your balance and body awareness\n- They prepare your body for more complex movements\n\n### 2. Locomotor vs. Non-Locomotor Movements\nHave you ever noticed how different it feels to walk across a room compared to reaching up to a high shelf? These are two different types of movement patterns your body can perform. When we talk about movement in physical education, we often split them into two main categories that help us understand how our bodies work in different situations.\n\n**Quick comparison:**\n| Locomotor Movements | Non-Locomotor Movements |\n|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Take you from place to place | Performed while staying in one spot |\n| Examples: walking, running, skipping | Examples: bending, stretching, twisting |\n| Focus on traveling | Focus on body control |\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think of 3 locomotor movements you did today (like walking to your computer). Now think of 3 non-locomotor movements you've done (like reaching for something or turning to look at something).\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n### 3. Exploring Each Movement\n\nLet's take a closer look at each non-locomotor movement. As you read about each one, try to picture yourself doing the movement. You might even want to stand up and try some of these movements right now! Each one uses different muscles and gives you a different feeling in your body.\n\n**Bending:**\n- Stand tall, then bend forward at your waist, trying to touch your toes\n- Bend your knees into a half-squat position\n- Bend your elbows to touch your shoulders\n\n**Stretching:**\n- Reach your arms up high as if trying to touch the ceiling\n- Extend your arms out to the sides like a star\n- Stretch one arm across your chest\n\n**Twisting:**\n- Keep your feet planted and twist your upper body to look behind you\n- Try twisting to both left and right sides\n- Keep your hips facing forward as you twist\n\n**Turning:**\n- Pivot on one foot to face a different direction\n- Try quarter turns, half turns, and full turns\n- Keep your balance as you turn\n\n**Pushing:**\n- Pretend you're pushing a heavy object away from you\n- Feel how your arm and shoulder muscles engage\n- Try pushing with one arm, then both arms\n\n**Pulling:**\n- Imagine pulling a rope in a tug-of-war\n- Feel your arm and back muscles working\n- Try different pulling positions (high, middle, low)\n\n### 4. Solo Movement Activities\nNow that you understand the different types of non-locomotor movements, it's time to put them into practice! The following activities are designed for you to do on your own, in whatever space you have available. You don't need any special equipment - just your body and enough room to move your arms without hitting anything.\n\n**Activity 1: Movement Freeze**\n- Choose a song you enjoy on your device\n- Move freely within your personal space (a small area in your room)\n- Pause the music yourself whenever you're ready\n- When the music stops, freeze in one of the non-locomotor positions\n- Hold each position for as long as comfortable (aim for 5-10 seconds)\n- Continue until you've practiced all six movements\n\n**Activity 2: Movement Challenge Cards**\nCreate your own challenge cards by writing these tasks on separate pieces of paper:\n1. Bend low and count at your own pace\n2. Stretch high for as long as comfortable\n3. Twist side to side as many times as you choose\n4. Turn in a full circle a few times\n5. Push against a wall or sturdy furniture for a comfortable duration\n6. Pull an imaginary rope at your own pace\n\nPlace the cards face down, pick one at random, and complete the challenge before moving to the next card.\n\n**Activity 3: Sports Connection**\nFor each sport below, demonstrate a non-locomotor movement used in that activity:\n\n- Basketball (defensive stance - bending)\n- Golf (twisting during swing)\n- Soccer (goalkeeper stretching to block)\n- Martial arts (turning to avoid)\n- Wrestling (pushing opponent)\n- Rowing (pulling motion)\n\n### 5. Creating Movement Sequences\n\nOnce you've practiced individual movements, you can start putting them together like pieces of a puzzle. Movement sequences are like creating your own dance or exercise routine. By connecting different movements, you'll improve your coordination and make smoother transitions from one position to another. This is a skill that athletes, dancers, and even everyday movers use all the time!\n\n**Basic Sequence:**\n1. Start standing tall\n2. Bend forward to touch your toes\n3. Slowly stretch back up with arms reaching high\n4. Twist to the right\n5. Return to center\n6. Twist to the left\n7. Return to center\n8. Turn in a full circle\n\n**Create Your Own:**\nDesign a sequence using at least 4 different non-locomotor movements. Practice until you can perform it smoothly. Try performing your sequence at different speeds (slow, medium, fast).\n\n## SELF-ASSESSMENT:\n\nNow that you've learned about and practiced non-locomotor movements, it's time to check in with yourself. How well do you think you can perform each movement? This self-assessment will help you recognize your strengths and identify areas where you might want more practice. Remember, everyone has movements that come more naturally to them than others!\n\n**Movement Mastery Checklist:**\nRate yourself on each movement from 1-5 (1=needs practice, 5=excellent):\n\n- Bending: _____\n- Stretching: _____\n- Twisting: _____\n- Turning: _____\n- Pushing: _____\n- Pulling: _____\n\n**Movement Journal:**\nConsider these questions and jot down your thoughts:\n1. Which non-locomotor movement feels most natural to you? Why?\n2. Which movement was most challenging? What made it difficult?\n3. How could improving these movements help you in your favorite activities or sports?\n4. Where do you use non-locomotor movements in your daily life?\n\n## HOME CONNECTION:\nThe movements you've learned aren't just for PE class - they're part of everyday life! This section will help you notice how often you use these movements without even thinking about it. By becoming more aware of your movements, you can start to move with more purpose and control throughout your day.\n\n**Movement Detective:**\nFor one day, be a \"movement detective\" in your home. Notice when you use non-locomotor movements in everyday activities. Make a list of at least 10 examples you observe in yourself (like bending to tie shoes or stretching to reach a high shelf).\n\n**Movement Challenge:**\nPractice explaining the difference between locomotor and non-locomotor movements out loud, as if teaching someone else. Perform your favorite movement sequence and see if you can make it smoother each time.\n\n**Modification Options:**\n- Limited mobility: Focus on movements you can do comfortably, perhaps seated in a chair\n- Small space: Define your personal space with a small rug or towel to practice movements\n- Extra challenge: Perform movements with your eyes closed to enhance body awareness\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Non-locomotor movements are actions performed while staying in one place, including bending, stretching, twisting, turning, pushing, and pulling.\n- These foundational movements build coordination, balance, and body awareness while preparing you for sports, dance, and everyday activities.\n- Creating sequences by combining different non-locomotor movements helps develop smooth transitions and control over your body.\n---keytakeawaysEND---"
