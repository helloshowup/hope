When you're running around in PE, playing sports or just having fun with friends, the food you eat before and after makes a real difference to your performance and how you feel. Good nutrition can give you more energy, help build stronger muscles, and keep you going during all your activities.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model shows how to build a balanced meal using a simple plate diagram. Your plate should include:\n- **Fruits**: These colourful foods provide quick energy and vitamins (apples, bananas, berries)\n- **Vegetables**: Packed with vitamins and minerals to support your health (carrots, broccoli, spinach)\n- **Grains**: These provide lasting energy for your activities (bread, pasta, rice - whole grain versions are best)\n- **Protein**: These foods help build and repair your muscles (chicken, beans, eggs, nuts)\n- **Dairy**: Great for building strong bones (milk, yogurt, cheese)\n\nIncluding foods from each group in your meals will help keep your body properly fuelled.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nA small snack about 30-60 minutes before exercise gives your body the energy it needs to perform well. Some good pre-workout snack ideas include:\n\n- **Banana with a spoonful of peanut butter**: The banana provides quick energy while the peanut butter helps that energy last longer\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: A tasty mix of quick energy and protein\n- **Yogurt with berries**: Easy to digest and full of nutrients\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These provide steady energy that won't disappear too quickly\n\nRemember: Keep your pre-workout snack light - just enough to fuel your activity without making you feel sluggish.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nAfter being active, your body needs to recover and repair. Eating within 30-45 minutes after exercise helps your muscles rebuild and grow stronger. Good post-workout foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: It's not just a treat - chocolate milk has a good balance of carbs and protein to help your body recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The protein helps repair muscles, while the wrap provides needed carbohydrates\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Quick to make and packed with nutrients\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: A flavourful combination that provides protein and carbs\n\nDon't forget to drink water after exercise! Replacing the fluids lost through sweat is a key part of recovery.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels tell you what's actually in the food you're eating. Here's what to look for:\n\n- **Serving size**: How much food counts as one serving\n- **Calories**: The amount of energy the food provides\n- **Protein**: Foods with good protein content help your muscles\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - whole grains and natural sugars are better choices than added sugars\n- **Sugars**: Try to limit foods with lots of added sugars\n- **Ingredients list**: Shorter lists with recognisable ingredients usually mean less processed foods\n\n## Over to You\nNext time you're at the shop or in your kitchen, compare the labels on two similar snacks. Which one would be better before or after exercise? Why? Try keeping a food diary for a day and see how your meals match up with the MyPlate model.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhat you eat before and after physical activity significantly impacts your performance and recovery. Using the MyPlate model, choosing appropriate pre- and post-workout snacks, and understanding food labels will help you make smart choices. With the right nutrition, you'll have more energy, build stronger muscles, and feel your best during all your activities!\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on \"Fuelling Your Body for Physical Activity\" for a physical education course. It covers the following key topics:\n\n1. The MyPlate model for building balanced meals\n2. Recommended pre-workout snacks to provide energy\n3. Ideal post-workout foods for recovery and muscle repair\n4. How to read and interpret food nutrition labels\n\nThe content is structured with clear learning objectives, explanatory sections, and practical application activities to help students understand the importance of proper nutrition for physical performance and overall health.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nBased on the provided enhancement prompt, the key objectives for transforming this classroom-based content into asynchronous online learning material are:\n\n1. **Structural Integrity (Critical)**: \n   - Maintain all original section headings exactly as written, except for removing the \"## Introduction\" heading\n   - Keep the identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n\n2. **Content Adaptation (Important)**: \n   - Convert all group activities to individual activities\n   - Replace teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n\n3. **Assessment Adaptation (Supporting)**: \n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience for this content is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) enrolled in an online physical education course at Excel Middle School. Key considerations for this learner profile include:\n\n- **Reading Level**: Content should be adapted to a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday language, active voice, and short sentences.\n- **Prior Knowledge**: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction, so explanations should be clear and relatable.\n- **Learning Style**: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities will be most effective.\n- **Physical Space/Equipment**: Adaptations are needed for limited access to specialized equipment and varying home spaces available to students.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed for asynchronous online delivery, with no peer interaction. Key considerations for this learning medium include:\n\n- All group activities must be converted to individual activities.\n- Teacher-led facilitation must be replaced with self-guided instructions.\n- Timed components need to be adapted to self-paced elements.\n- Assessment sections should be transformed into brief reinforcement paragraphs with self-assessment mechanisms.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the core educational value and integrity of the original content.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to suit the 5th-6th grade reading level of the target learners.\n- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and visual aids to support independent learning.\n- Offer alternative options for activities and equipment to accommodate varying home environments.\n- Emphasize safety considerations and provide guidance for modifying exercises as needed.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Preserve the original section headings, sequence, and numbering to maintain structural integrity.\n2. Remove the \"## Introduction\" heading while retaining its content.\n3. Convert all group activities to individual, self-guided exercises with clear instructions.\n4. Adapt references to classroom spaces, equipment, and teacher facilitation to suit the home environment and independent learning format.\n5. Transform assessment sections into brief reinforcement paragraphs with self-assessment mechanisms.\n6. Simplify language, use everyday examples, and incorporate more visual aids to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level.\n7. Provide alternative options for activities and equipment to accommodate varying home environments and physical abilities.\n8. Emphasize safety considerations, proper form, and modification guidance throughout the content.\n9. Maintain the overall educational value and progression of the original material while optimizing for asynchronous online delivery.\n\nThis preparatory context should serve as a comprehensive guide for subsequent content enhancement, ensuring the transformed material effectively meets the needs of the target learners in the specified online learning environment.",
