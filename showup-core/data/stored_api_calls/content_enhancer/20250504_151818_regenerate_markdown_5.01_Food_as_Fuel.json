Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n- You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n- Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n- Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n- Activity: Stand up and do 10 jumping jacks. Take a moment to notice how your breathing changes. Your body just used carbohydrates to power that movement.\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n- Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n- Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n- This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n- Activity: Gently squeeze your arm muscle. The firmness you feel is made of protein that helps your body move.\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n- Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n- Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n- Your brain needs fats to work well\n- We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein, but they're still important for health\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert an \"Audio Instructions\" section within the markers ---audioinstructions--- and ---audioinstructionsEND---. Create this based on the content that follows this instruction block. The section should include a heading \"### Audio Instructions: \" followed by a brief title that describes the key action or concept being explained (e.g., \"How to Skip\" should be replaced with an appropriate title based on the following content). Then include a URL in this format: https://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/X-X-Y.mp3 where X-X should match the lesson number found at the top of the document (e.g., \"2.1\" would become \"2-1\"), and Y should be a sequential number starting with 1 for the first audio instruction in the file, 2 for the second, etc. Place this section at the appropriate point in the content where audio guidance would be most helpful.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items\n2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings\n4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in\n3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle\n4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)\n5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:\n\n- Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)\n- An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database\n- A food guide chart (included below)\n\n### Example of Completed Activity:\n\n- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana\n- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt\n- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.\n- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.\n- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a paragraph so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Remember this is suppose to be read] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  - 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  - 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  - After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  - 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  - 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  - 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  - Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  - Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  - Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  - Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  - Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Knowledge Check and Application Activities\n\n### My Performance Plate Activity:\n1. Materials needed: Paper, pencil, and coloring supplies (optional)\n2. Draw a circle to represent a plate\n3. Divide your plate according to the \"Perfect Plate\" guidelines above\n4. In each section, draw or write specific foods you would eat:\n\n- Before your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"Before\")\n- After your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"After\")\n5. For each plate, write why you chose those specific foods\n6. Success criteria: Your \"Before\" plate should include quick energy foods (mainly carbs), while your \"After\" plate should include recovery foods (protein and carbs)\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your body needs three main nutrients for physical activity: carbohydrates for quick energy, proteins for muscle building and repair, and fats for long-lasting energy.\n- Timing your meals matters for performance - eat larger balanced meals 2-3 hours before activity, quick carbs 30-60 minutes before, and protein with carbs after exercise for recovery.\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" for active bodies includes half fruits and vegetables, one-quarter grains, one-quarter protein foods, and a small amount of healthy fats.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n",

Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\nThink of your body like a car that needs the right fuel to run properly. Just as cars need gasoline, your body needs nutrients to move, play, and grow. When you're active - whether you're playing basketball at recess or riding your bike after school - your body uses three main types of nutrients to keep you going. Let's explore each one and discover how they help power all the amazing things your body can do!\n\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\nImagine you're about to race your friend across the playground. Your body needs energy right away! That's where carbohydrates come in. Carbs are like the kindling that starts a campfire - they light up quickly and give you immediate power. When you eat foods like pasta before a soccer game or an apple at lunch, you're giving your body the quick fuel it needs to run, jump, and play.\n\n- Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n- You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n- Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n- Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n- Activity: Stand up and do 10 jumping jacks. Take a moment to notice how your breathing changes. Your body just used carbohydrates to power that movement.\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\nHave you ever noticed how your legs feel a bit sore the day after a long bike ride or hike? That's your muscles saying, \"Hey, we worked hard and now we need to rebuild!\" Proteins are the construction workers of your body. After you exercise, these tiny workers rush in to repair and strengthen your muscles. Foods like chicken in your sandwich or beans in your burrito are sending in these helpful workers to make your body stronger.\n\n- Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n- Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n- Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n- This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n- Activity: Gently squeeze your arm muscle. The firmness you feel is made of protein that helps your body move.\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\nIf carbs are like kindling for a fire, then healthy fats are like the big logs that keep the fire burning for hours. When you're playing in an all-day soccer tournament or going on a long hike, your body needs energy that lasts. Healthy fats provide this slow-burning fuel that helps you keep going when your quick energy is used up.\n\n- Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n- Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n- Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n- Your brain needs fats to work well\n- We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein, but they're still important for health\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n\n---audioinstructions---\n### Audio Instructions: How to Sort Foods by Nutrients\n\nhttps://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/5-1-1.mp3\n---audioinstructionsEND---\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items\n2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings\n4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in\n3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle\n4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)\n5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:\n\n- Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)\n- An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database\n- A food guide chart (included below)\n\n### Example of Completed Activity:\n\n- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana\n- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt\n- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\nDon't worry if you get stuck during this activity – even nutrition scientists sometimes debate about how to classify certain foods! Many of the foods we eat daily are combinations of different nutrients. For example, whole milk contains both protein and fat, while beans have both protein and carbs. If you're unsure, try looking at the food label or asking an adult at home. Remember, the goal isn't to get everything perfectly right, but to start thinking about what's in your food and how it helps your body.\n\n- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.\n- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.\n- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\nJust like you wouldn't fill your water bottle after finishing a long bike ride (when you're already thirsty!), timing your food is super important for feeling your best during physical activities. Your body needs different types of fuel depending on whether you're about to start playing, in the middle of a game, or recovering afterward. The food choices you make can be your secret weapon for having more energy, playing better, and feeling stronger after exercise.\n\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  - 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  - 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  - After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  - 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  - 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  - 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  - Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  - Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  - Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  - Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  - Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Knowledge Check and Application Activities\n\n### My Performance Plate Activity:\n1.
