That's where tracking your fitness comes in. By recording your physical activities in simple ways, you can actually see your progress, which feels great and keeps you motivated. Plus, you'll build valuable skills like self-awareness and goal-setting that help in many areas of life.\n\n## Why Track Your Progress?\nTracking your fitness is a bit like having a map on an adventure - it shows where you've been and helps you figure out where to go next. Here's why it matters:\n\n- **See Your Improvements**: Recording what you do lets you look back and notice how much stronger or faster you've become\n- **Stay Motivated**: It's much easier to keep exercising when you can see your hard work paying off\n- **Set Better Goals**: Tracking helps you create realistic targets based on what you've already achieved\n- **Build Confidence**: There's a real sense of accomplishment when you can see how far you've come\n\n## Simple Ways to Track Progress\n\n### Fitness Journal\nA fitness journal can be as simple as a notebook where you write down:\n- What exercise you did\n- How long you did it\n- How it made you feel\n- Any personal records or achievements\n\nYou might find decorating your journal with stickers or drawings makes it more enjoyable!\n\n### Calendar Method\nGet a calendar and use coloured markers or stickers to track your activities:\n- Blue dot = went for a walk or run\n- Red dot = did strength exercises (like push-ups or sit-ups)\n- Green dot = played a sport\n- Yellow star = reached a personal best!\n\nAll those colourful dots add up and show how consistent you've been over time.\n\n### Before and After Tests\nTry these simple fitness tests every few weeks to measure your progress:\n- How many push-ups can you do?\n- How long can you hold a plank? (A plank is when you hold your body straight like a board, supporting yourself on your forearms and toes)\n- How far can you run in 6 minutes?\n- How many jumping jacks in 1 minute?\n\nRecord your scores with dates so you can compare them as weeks go by.\n\n### Rating System\nAfter each workout, rate these things on a scale of 1-5:\n- How hard was it? (1 = super easy, 5 = really challenging)\n- How fun was it? (1 = boring, 5 = awesome!)\n- How do you feel afterward? (1 = tired, 5 = energised)\n\nThis helps you discover which activities you enjoy most and how your body responds to different types of exercise.\n\n## Celebrating Your Progress\nDon't forget to celebrate improvements! Here are some ways to acknowledge your hard work:\n\n- Tell a family member about your achievements\n- Create a \"progress wall\" in your room with your fitness milestones\n- Give yourself small rewards when you reach goals (like extra game time or a new water bottle)\n- Take a moment to feel proud of yourself - you've earned it!\n\n## Activity: Create Your Tracking System\nLet's put what we've learned into action! Take as much time as you need to:\n1. Choose one tracking method you want to try\n2. Set up your journal, calendar, or tracking sheet\n3. Write down 2-3 fitness goals you want to work toward\n4. Plan when and how you'll record your progress\n\nRemember, the best tracking system is one that you'll actually use, so keep it fun and straightforward!\n\n## Conclusion\nTracking your fitness isn't just about getting stronger or faster - it's about learning to set goals, stick with them, and celebrate your success. These skills will help you in school, sports, and beyond. Even when exercise feels tough, your tracking system will remind you of how far you've come and help you stay motivated. So grab that journal or calendar and start tracking - your future self will thank you!\n\n## Over to You\nThink about these questions as you set up your tracking system:\n- Which tracking method seems best for your personality and home situation?\n- What's one fitness goal you're excited to track?\n- How might seeing your progress help you stick with your fitness routine?\n- How could you use these tracking skills for other things you want to improve?",
