Whether designing a website, brand identity, or marketing collateral, the strategic use of color creates an immediate emotional response that shapes how audiences perceive and interact with our work.

  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational piece that explores how strategic use of color, typography, and composition in graphic design can shape the emotional atmosphere and audience perception of visual experiences. It covers key principles and best practices for leveraging these elements to craft intentional brand identities and communication materials.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe primary enhancement required is to carefully review the text and correct any American or non-British English spellings to their proper British equivalents, following the specific guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt. This includes changes such as '-our' instead of '-or', '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze', '-re' instead of '-er', and various other spelling conventions. No other changes to the content, structure, or formatting are permitted.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18+, with varied backgrounds but a shared focus on developing specialized skills and industry-ready capabilities. They are highly self-motivated, visually-oriented learners who access content through both in-person sessions and fully online platforms.\n\nKey considerations for this audience:\n- Appropriate language level, examples, and complexity to match their existing knowledge and skill level\n- Emphasis on practical, hands-on learning through interactive exercises and assignments\n- Visually-rich content with high-quality demonstrations, annotated examples, and comprehensive image galleries\n- Flexibility to accommodate both guided and independent learning approaches\n- Relevance to their career-focused goals and portfolio-building needs\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of in-person sessions and fully online platforms, with learners accessing all materials, instruction, and assessment exclusively through digital channels.\n\nThis requires the content to be optimized for asynchronous online learning, with a focus on:\n- Clear, concise language and structure to facilitate self-directed study\n- Robust visual support to compensate for lack of in-person demonstrations\n- Seamless integration with any interactive exercises or practical assignments\n- Consideration for potential technical troubleshooting or workflow management challenges\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content\n- Ensure the content remains relevant, engaging, and impactful for the target learner audience\n- Preserve the original structure, formatting, and punctuation as much as possible while making only the necessary spelling corrections\n- Avoid any changes that could inadvertently alter the meaning, tone, or intended messaging\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the entire text, identifying any American or non-British spellings that need to be corrected to their proper British English equivalents.\n2. Make the minimum number of changes required to address the spelling issues, following the specific guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n3. Ensure all technical terms with standard spellings are left unchanged.\n4. Preserve the original formatting, layout, and punctuation throughout the content.\n5. Validate that the enhanced content maintains the educational integrity, emotional resonance, and practical value for the target learner audience.\n6. Consider opportunities to further optimize the visual support, interactive elements, or supplementary resources to enhance the online learning experience, but only if these improvements can be made without altering the core content.\n\nThe goal is to deliver a version of the content that adheres to British English spelling conventions while preserving the original intent, structure, and educational value for the HND Graphic Design students.",
