  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module focused on introducing and testing the four key components of physical fitness: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility. It provides a series of simple fitness challenges that students can try on their own to assess their current abilities in each area.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests the addition of linking paragraphs between the fitness test instructions to create a more natural, cohesive flow. The goal is to ensure the content reads smoothly and does not feel like it was generated by AI.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use language and examples appropriate for this age group, avoiding complex terminology or overly technical explanations. Sentences should be concise, and the overall tone should be friendly and conversational to engage middle school students.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is part of an asynchronous online curriculum for Excel Middle School, with no opportunities for peer interaction. As such, the enhanced content must be self-contained and provide clear, step-by-step instructions that students can follow independently. Visuals, such as images and diagrams, will be crucial to support understanding and proper exercise execution.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity of the fitness tests and their purpose in assessing the four key components of physical fitness.\n- Ensure the enhanced content flows logically and naturally between the fitness test instructions.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school student audience.\n- Incorporate visual elements, such as images and diagrams, to support student understanding and engagement.\n- Provide clear safety guidelines and modifications for the fitness challenges to accommodate various home environments and physical abilities.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify the key themes, concepts, and structure.\n2. Analyze the enhancement prompt and extract the specific requirements for adding linking paragraphs.\n3. Tailor the language, examples, and complexity of the content to the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school student audience.\n4. Incorporate visual elements, such as images and diagrams, to support student understanding and engagement.\n5. Ensure the enhanced content flows logically and naturally between the fitness test instructions, creating a cohesive learning experience.\n6. Provide clear safety guidelines and modifications for the fitness challenges to accommodate various home environments and physical abilities.\n7. Review the final enhanced content to ensure it maintains the educational integrity of the original material while addressing the specific needs of the target learner.",

  "response": "# 1.2 Test Your Fitness Superpowers!\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n\n- Name the 4 parts of fitness\n- Try each fitness test on your own\n- Track your scores to see how you improve\n\nNow that you understand the four components of fitness, it's time to put your own abilities to the test! Everyone has different natural strengths - some people might be super flexible while others have amazing endurance. The cool thing is that no matter where you start, you can improve in all areas with practice.\n\nCurious about your own fitness abilities? Try these simple tests:\n\n### Cardiovascular Endurance Test\n\nLet's start by checking how well your heart and lungs work together to keep your body moving. Cardiovascular endurance is all about how long you can keep going during physical activity without getting too tired. This first test will get your heart pumping!\n\n**Jumping Jacks Challenge**\n\n1. Set a timer for 1 minute\n2. Do as many jumping jacks as you can\n3. Count how many you complete\n4. Can you do more than 50 with good form? That's pretty impressive!\n\n### Muscular Strength Test\n\nNow that you've warmed up your body with jumping jacks, let's see how strong your muscles are! Muscular strength is about how much force your muscles can produce in a single effort. Push-ups are a great way to test the strength in your arms, chest, and core all at once.\n\n**Push-Up Challenge**\n\n1. Start in a plank position with your hands under your shoulders\n2. Lower your body until your elbows form 90-degree angles (like an L shape)\n3. Push back up to the starting position\n4. Count how many push-ups you can do with good form\n5. Write down your number and try to beat it next time!\n\n### Muscular Endurance Test\n\nYour arms might be feeling a bit tired after those push-ups - that's perfect! Now we'll test something different: how long your muscles can work without getting tired. While strength is about power, endurance is about lasting power. Let's see how your leg muscles hold up in this next challenge.\n\n**Wall Sit Challenge**\n\n1. Stand with your back against a wall\n2. Slide down until your knees are bent at 90 degrees (like sitting in an invisible chair)\n3. Time how long you can hold this position\n4. Try to improve your time each week!\n\n### Flexibility Test\n\nFor our final test, let's slow things down and check your flexibility. Being flexible helps you move more easily and can prevent injuries. After all that muscle work, a good stretch probably feels pretty nice right about now!\n\n**Sit and Reach**\n\n1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you\n2. Reach forward toward your toes\n3. Notice how far you can reach - can you touch your toes?\n4. Regular stretching will help you reach further!"
