  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a video script that provides an overview of art direction, its key principles, and strategies for developing art direction skills as a graphic design student. The script covers the role of an art director, the necessary competencies, and how students can start building relevant experience during their studies. The content is structured with an introduction, a skills hierarchy diagram, and a section on building art direction experience.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Add two paragraphs that officially define art direction in a more formal, less conversational tone.\n2. Ensure the content maintains a consistent, professional tone throughout.\n3. Optimize the content for asynchronous online delivery, focusing on clear explanations, visual aids, and interactive elements.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18+, with varied backgrounds but a foundational understanding of design principles and software.\n- They are highly self-motivated, visually-oriented learners who prefer hands-on, self-directed activities and digital alternatives to in-person instruction.\n- The content should use UK English spelling and terminology, avoid overly casual language, and provide a clear, structured learning experience.\n- Examples, visuals, and case studies should be tailored to the learners' level of expertise and industry-readiness.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered asynchronously through online learning platforms, so it must be optimized for self-paced, digital consumption. This includes:\n- Incorporating interactive elements, such as quizzes, exercises, and annotated examples\n- Ensuring all visuals, diagrams, and multimedia are high-quality and accessible\n- Providing clear navigation, signposting, and opportunities for self-reflection\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and professional tone of the content\n- Clearly define art direction and its role within the graphic design industry\n- Highlight the collaborative nature of the art director's work and the importance of communication skills\n- Provide practical strategies for students to start developing art direction competencies\n- Leverage visual aids, case studies, and interactive elements to enhance the online learning experience\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Craft a formal, concise definition of art direction that sets the tone for the content.\n2. Ensure a consistent, professional voice throughout the script, avoiding overly casual language.\n3. Incorporate more interactive elements, such as self-assessment quizzes, annotated examples, and guided exercises, to engage the learners.\n4. Expand the visual aids, including more detailed diagrams, process breakdowns, and industry case studies, to support the learners' visual preferences.\n5. Maintain the structure and flow of the original content while enhancing it for asynchronous online delivery.",

An art director establishes the creative vision, ensures brand consistency, directs creative professionals, manages design teams, and presents concepts to stakeholders.\n\nArt direction, in professional practice, refers to the strategic oversight and management of visual elements across multiple platforms to achieve a cohesive aesthetic and communicate a specific message or brand identity. It encompasses the deliberate planning, coordination and implementation of visual strategies that align with business objectives while maintaining creative integrity throughout the execution process.\n\nWithin the graphic design industry, art direction serves as the unifying framework that bridges individual design components with overarching brand narratives. It requires a sophisticated understanding of visual hierarchies, audience psychology, and market positioning—transforming disparate creative elements into a harmonious visual language that resonates with target demographics while fulfilling specific communication goals.\n\n[VISUAL: Diagram showing art director's relationships with photographers, designers, illustrators, and clients]\n\nThe most valuable skills for art direction include visual leadership—developing and communicating a cohesive strategy; technical knowledge of design principles; project management capabilities; strong communication skills; and industry awareness.\n\n[VISUAL: Skills hierarchy pyramid showing foundational to advanced art direction competencies]\n\nArt direction is like a film director bringing together actors, cinematographers, and set designers to create a unified vision.
