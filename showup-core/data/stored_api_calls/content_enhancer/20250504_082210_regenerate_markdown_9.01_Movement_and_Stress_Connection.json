Everyone experiences it! You might feel it before a test, during an argument with a friend, or when trying something new.\n\nWhen you're stressed, your body responds in specific ways:\n- Your muscles get tight and tense\n- Your heart beats faster\n- Your breathing gets quicker and shallower\n- You might find it hard to focus or think clearly\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person showing physical signs of stress with labelled arrows pointing to tense shoulders, racing heart, and worried expression]\n\n## How Movement Helps Beat Stress\n\nMoving your body is one of the most effective ways to fight stress! Here's how it helps:\n\n### Feel-Good Brain Chemicals\nWhen you exercise, your brain releases special chemicals called endorphins. These are your body's natural mood boosters! They help you feel happier and more relaxed.\n\n### Burns Off Extra Energy\nStress can make you feel jumpy or restless. Moving your body helps use up this extra energy so you feel calmer.\n\n### Helps You Sleep Better\nRegular exercise helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly. Getting enough good sleep makes a real difference in how you handle stress.\n\n### Takes Your Mind Off Worries\nWhen you focus on moving your body, your brain gets a break from thinking about what's stressing you out.\n\n![Image: Simple diagram showing how exercise affects the brain with arrows connecting movement to positive outcomes]\n\n## Stress-Busting Moves You Can Try at Home\n\nTry these activities when you're feeling stressed. You don't need special equipment or a lot of space!\n\n### 1. Tension Release Stretches\n**What you need:** Just your body and enough space to stretch your arms out\n**Time needed:** 5 minutes\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart\n2. Take a deep breath in while raising your shoulders up to your ears\n3. Hold for 3 seconds, feeling the tension\n4. Breathe out and drop your shoulders down, releasing all the tension\n5. Repeat 5 times\n6. Try the same with other body parts - make fists then release, scrunch your face then relax\n\n**Safety tip:** Never stretch to the point of pain. You should feel a gentle pull, not sharp pain.\n\n![Image: Simple illustrations showing the shoulder tension-release sequence]\n\n### 2. Energy Burners\n**What you need:** A small space where you can move freely\n**Time needed:** 3-5 minutes\n\nChoose from these quick moves:\n- Jumping jacks - Do 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds, repeat 3 times\n- Invisible jump rope - Pretend to jump rope for 1 minute\n- Dance party - Put on your favourite song and dance however you want!\n\n**Modification:** If you need to stay quiet, try \"silent\" versions - smaller movements without the jumping.\n\n![Image: Simple illustrations of the three energy-burning activities]\n\n### 3. Calm-Down Corner\n**What you need:** A quiet spot where you can sit comfortably\n**Time needed:** 5 minutes\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Find a comfortable sitting position\n2. Place one hand on your belly\n3. Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts (feel your belly expand)\n4. Hold your breath for 2 counts\n5. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 6 counts\n6. Repeat 10 times\n\n**Tip:** This is called \"belly breathing\" and it helps calm your nervous system quickly!\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person doing belly breathing with arrows showing the breath movement]\n\n## Know Your Stress Signals\n\nEveryone shows stress differently. Recognizing your personal stress signals helps you catch stress early!\n\n### Stop and Think\nCheck in with your body right now. Do you notice any of these common stress signals?\n\n- Tight jaw or clenched teeth\n- Headache or feeling dizzy\n- Stomachache or butterflies\n- Cold or sweaty hands\n- Racing thoughts\n- Feeling irritable or cranky\n\nCircle or write down the signals you notice when you're stressed. These are YOUR stress warning signs!\n\n![Image: Body outline with common stress points highlighted]\n\n## Over to You!\n\n**Your Stress-Busting Plan**\n1. Pick one movement activity from this lesson that you want to try\n2. Decide when you'll do it (after school? before bed?)\n3. Try it for at least 5 minutes\n4. Notice how you feel before and after\n\n**Remember:** Moving your body is just one way to handle stress. Getting enough sleep, talking to someone you trust, and taking breaks are all valuable too!\n\n## Check Your Understanding\nAnswer these questions to see what you've learnt:\n\n1. Name two ways stress can affect your body.\n2. How does exercise help reduce stress?\n3. Which stress-busting activity would you choose if you needed to be quiet?\n4. What are two of your personal stress signals?\n\n## Need Help?\nIf stress feels too big to handle on your own, that's okay! Talk to a trusted adult like a parent, teacher, or school counsellor. They can help you find more ways to manage stress.\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on using physical movement to manage stress. It covers the following key elements:\n\n1. Understanding what stress is and how it manifests physically\n2. Explaining how different types of movement can help reduce stress\n3. Providing specific stress-relief exercises and activities that can be done at home\n4. Helping learners identify their personal stress signals\n5. Encouraging learners to create a personal stress-management plan\n\nThe content is structured with clear learning objectives, explanatory sections, step-by-step activity instructions, and self-reflection prompts. It includes relevant images, diagrams, and visual examples to support the educational material.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL): Maintain all original section headings, sequence, and numbering exactly as written, with the exception of removing the \"## Introduction\" heading.\n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT): Convert all group activities to individual activities, replace teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions, adapt classroom/equipment references to home environment options, and convert timed components to self-paced elements.\n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING): Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms.\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) with varying exposure to physical education concepts and limited formal PE instruction. Key adaptations needed include:\n\n- Language and Readability: Keep content at a 5th-6th grade reading level using everyday words, active voice, and direct instructions.\n- Structure and Organization: Use frequent headings, short paragraphs, numbered steps, and visual breaks to create clear \"chunks\" of information.\n- Visual Elements: Include relevant images, diagrams, labeled illustrations, and visual examples for each new exercise or activity.\n- Engagement Strategies: Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers, use a conversational tone, and create achievable challenges for various home environments.\n- Equipment and Space Considerations: Provide alternatives using common household items and adaptations for small or shared living spaces.\n- Safety Guidelines: Offer clear safety warnings, warm-up/cool-down instructions, modified versions, and guidance on proper form over speed/repetitions.\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed from a classroom-based format to asynchronous online learning. Key considerations include:\n\n- Removing all group activities, teacher-led facilitation, and timed/synchronous elements.\n- Adapting assessment components to self-guided reinforcement and self-assessment mechanisms.\n- Ensuring all instructions, explanations, and activities can be effectively completed independently by the learner.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Preserve the original content's core educational value and learning objectives.\n- Maintain the logical flow and progression of the material.\n- Adapt the content to enable effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.\n- Ensure the transformed content remains engaging, accessible, and supportive for the target learner profile.\n\n# Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the original content to fully understand the key themes, concepts, and educational structure.\n2. Extract the specific requirements from the enhancement prompt, prioritizing structural integrity, content adaptation, and assessment adaptation.\n3. Analyze the target learner profile to determine appropriate language, examples, visuals, and engagement strategies.\n4. Identify all group activities, teacher-led elements, timed components, and location/equipment-dependent references within the original content.\n5. Transform the content by:\n   - Maintaining all original section headings, sequence, and numbering (except \"Introduction\")\n   - Converting group activities to individual activities\n   - Replacing teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapting classroom/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Converting timed components to self-paced elements\n   - Transforming assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and self-assessment mechanisms\n6. Ensure the adapted content remains engaging, accessible, and supportive for the 11-14 year old target learners in an asynchronous online environment.\n7. Preserve the original content's core educational value and learning objectives throughout the transformation process.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
