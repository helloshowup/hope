This will help you recognize how many opportunities for movement are actually around you!\n\n### Safety Reminders\n* Always tell an adult where you're going to be active\n* Bring water when exercising\n* Stop if something hurts\n* For online workouts, make sure you have enough space to move safely\n\n## What You've Learned\nYou've discovered:\n* Different places to be active in your community\n* How to find information about local activities\n* Free and low-cost ways to exercise\n* Online workout options for when you're at home\n\n## Next Steps\nNow that you know where to find activities, think about which ones match your interests.
