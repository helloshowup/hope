Use your judgment when making revisions.]\n\nStakeholders are all the people who will be affected by your robotics solution. They might include users who will directly interact with your robot, people who will benefit from its work, and even those who might be concerned about its operation.\n\nTo identify stakeholders, ask questions like:\n- Who will use the robot?\n- Who will benefit from the robot's actions?\n- Who might be concerned about the robot operating in their space?\n- Who will maintain or repair the robot?\n\nFor example, if you're designing a robot to help in a school cafeteria, stakeholders might include students, cafeteria staff, custodians, and school administrators.\n\nOnce you've identified stakeholders, you need to understand their specific needs. This might involve:\n- Interviewing potential users\n- Observing the current situation\n- Conducting surveys\n- Creating user personas (fictional characters that represent different user types)\n\nUnderstanding these needs helps ensure your robot will actually be useful and accepted by the people it's designed to help.\n\n### **Setting Constraints and Requirements**\n\n**Constraints** are the limitations your solution must work within. They might include:\n\n- Physical constraints: size, weight, or the environment where the robot will operate\n- Technical constraints: available power sources, materials, or technology\n- Time constraints: deadlines for completion or how quickly the robot must perform tasks\n- Budget constraints: how much money is available for building and maintaining the robot\n- Safety constraints: ensuring the robot won't harm people or property\n\n**Requirements** are the specific things your solution must do or have. For example:\n- The robot must be able to climb stairs\n- The robot must operate for at least 3 hours on a single charge\n- The robot must be controllable by someone with limited hand mobility\n\nClearly defining these constraints and requirements early helps prevent wasted effort on solutions that won't work in the real world. They act as guardrails for your creativity, ensuring your ideas remain practical and feasible.\n\n## **Activity 1: Problem Definition Workshop**\n\nPractice writing problem statements for given robotics scenarios using a structured template. For each scenario, identify the affected stakeholders, list the constraints, and define success criteria. Complete at least two scenario exercises to build your problem definition skills.\n\n## **Problem Analysis Techniques**\n\nOnce you've identified a problem, it's important to dig deeper to fully understand it. Just like a doctor doesn't prescribe medicine without first diagnosing the illness, we shouldn't jump to solutions without thoroughly analyzing the problem.\n\n### **Root Cause Analysis**\n\nRoot cause analysis helps us look beyond the symptoms of a problem to find what's really causing it. Two popular techniques for this are:\n\nThe **\"5 Whys\"** technique involves asking \"why\" repeatedly to dig deeper into a problem. For example:\n- Why is the hallway delivery robot stopping unexpectedly? Because its sensors detect obstacles.\n- Why are sensors detecting obstacles when none are visible? Because reflections from the floor tiles are confusing the sensors.\n- Why are reflections causing confusion? Because the sensor algorithm can't distinguish between real obstacles and reflections.\n- Why can't the algorithm distinguish these? Because it was programmed for matte surfaces, not shiny floors.\n- Why was it programmed this way? Because the original testing environment had different flooring.\n\nBy the fifth \"why,\" we've found a root cause we can address - the sensor algorithm needs updating for shiny floors.\n\n**Fishbone diagrams** (also called Ishikawa diagrams) help visualize multiple potential causes. You draw a \"fish skeleton\" with the problem as the head, and different categories of causes (like People, Methods, Materials, Environment) as the bones. This helps you consider all possible factors contributing to the problem.\n\nUsing these techniques helps ensure you're solving the real problem, not just treating symptoms.\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of identifying stakeholders and defining constraints and requirements when designing a robotics solution. It covers key concepts such as:\n- Identifying stakeholders who will be affected by the robotics solution\n- Understanding the specific needs and concerns of different stakeholders\n- Defining the constraints (limitations) the solution must work within\n- Establishing clear requirements for what the solution must be able to do\n- Techniques for deeper problem analysis, such as root cause analysis and fishbone diagrams\n\nThe content is structured with clear headings, explanations, and examples to guide the reader through the process of problem definition for a robotics project.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nBased on the provided enhancement prompt, the key objectives for content enhancement are:\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the existing content\n2. Address any AI writing patterns detected in the analysis report to create a more natural, human-like writing style\n3. Ensure the content is appropriately adapted for the target learner profile\n4. Optimize the content for effective delivery through the specified asynchronous online learning medium\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are middle school students (ages 11-14) in an online robotics course. Key considerations for this audience include:\n- Reading level: Content should be written at a 5th-6th grade reading level, using simple language and sentence structure.\n- Prior knowledge: Learners may have varying exposure to STEM concepts, so explanations should assume limited prior knowledge of robotics.\n- Learning style: Visual demonstrations, hands-on activities, and real-world examples will be most engaging for this age group.\n- Technology access: While some learners may have access to physical robotics equipment, the content should be designed for asynchronous online delivery without relying on specialized hardware.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content will be delivered through an asynchronous online learning platform, with no opportunity for peer interaction. Key considerations for this medium include:\n- Content should be structured in clear, self-contained \"chunks\" with visual breaks to maintain engagement.\n- Explanations and instructions should be direct and easy to follow without additional guidance.\n- Multimedia elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations will be important to support understanding.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core educational value and flow of the existing content, while enhancing the writing style and adapting for the target learner.\n- Address any AI writing patterns identified in the analysis report to create a more natural, conversational tone.\n- Ensure all technical terms are clearly defined and that the content is accessible to learners with limited prior robotics knowledge.\n- Incorporate engaging elements like real-world examples, \"Stop and Think\" moments, and visual aids to support learning.\n- Maintain consistent formatting and organization to align with the established structure of the online course.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the AI writing analysis report and identify opportunities to revise common phrases, spelling variations, and other patterns to create a more human-like writing style.\n2. Adapt the language, sentence structure, and explanatory depth to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level of the target learners.\n3. Incorporate more conversational phrasing, real-world examples, and interactive elements to engage middle school students.\n4. Break content into clear, visually-distinct sections with frequent headings, subheadings, and other organizational cues.\n5. Ensure all technical terms are defined immediately upon introduction and that explanations are straightforward for learners with limited prior robotics knowledge.\n6. Add relevant images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations to support understanding of key concepts.\n7. Preserve the core educational value and flow of the existing content while enhancing it for the target learner and learning medium.",
