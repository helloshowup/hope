Think about how easily a bicycle rolls along a smooth path compared to how quickly you get tired walking the same distance. This difference is even more dramatic with robots.\n\n**Wheeled robots** are efficient because they maintain continuous contact with the ground, rolling smoothly with minimal energy loss. Once a wheeled robot gets moving, it takes relatively little energy to keep it going, especially on flat surfaces. This efficiency translates to longer battery life and greater operating range.\n\n**Legged robots**, by contrast, must constantly work against gravity. Each step requires lifting the leg, moving it forward, placing it down, and shifting weight - all actions that consume energy. The motors in the joints must repeatedly start and stop, which uses more power than the continuous rotation of wheel motors. A typical legged robot might use 5-10 times more energy than a wheeled robot of similar size to cover the same distance on flat ground.\n\nHowever, this efficiency gap narrows significantly on rough terrain. When wheels encounter obstacles, they must either climb over them (requiring substantial energy) or go around them (adding distance). Legs can simply step over many obstacles, potentially making them more efficient in highly complex environments.\n\n### **Terrain Navigation Abilities**\n\nLet's explore how wheels and legs perform across different environments. The terrain navigation capabilities of wheels and legs differ dramatically, with each excelling in different conditions.\n\n**Wheeled robots** perform best on smooth, continuous surfaces like floors, roads, and well-maintained paths. They struggle with:\n- **Stairs and ledges**: Wheels can't easily climb steps unless they're very large relative to the step height\n- **Gaps and crevices**: Even small gaps can trap or stop wheels\n- **Very soft surfaces**: Wheels may sink into sand, mud, or snow\n- **Highly uneven terrain**: Bumpy surfaces can cause wheels to lose contact with the ground\n\n**Legged robots** shine in precisely these challenging environments. They can:\n- Step over obstacles rather than having to climb them\n- Place feet carefully to avoid gaps or unstable areas\n- Distribute weight to avoid sinking in soft surfaces\n- Adapt their gait to match terrain conditions\n\nThis terrain adaptability makes legged robots ideal for outdoor exploration, disaster response, and any environment not specifically designed for wheeled vehicles. The more unpredictable and varied the terrain, the more advantages legs typically offer over wheels.\n\nA great example of this difference can be seen with robot vacuums. Most use wheels to efficiently clean flat floors, but struggle with thick carpet edges or small steps between rooms. Some newer models now include sensors that detect stairs and obstacles, stopping the robot before it gets stuck. These sensors act like simple \"eyes\" that help the robot understand its environment and make better movement decisions.\n\n### **Speed vs. Versatility**\n\nNow that we understand efficiency and terrain capabilities, let's consider how these factors affect speed and versatility. When comparing these aspects, we see a clear tradeoff between these two movement methods.\n\n**Wheeled robots** generally achieve higher top speeds with less complexity. Racing robots on smooth tracks can reach impressive velocities with relatively simple designs. Wheels also provide stability at speed, allowing for fast, predictable movement. However, this speed advantage is highly dependent on terrain - put that same racing robot on a rocky path, and it might not move at all.\n\n**Legged robots** typically move more slowly but can maintain their mobility across a wider range of environments. While the fastest legged robots (like Boston Dynamics' Cheetah) can reach speeds comparable to wheeled robots on flat ground, they require much more complex systems to do so. The real advantage of legs is versatility - being able to adapt to different surfaces and obstacles without significant speed reduction.\n\nThis speed-versatility tradeoff leads to an important design principle: choose wheels when you need speed in a controlled environment, and choose legs when you need versatility in an unpredictable environment. Many advanced robot designs actually combine both approaches, using wheels for efficient movement on flat surfaces and legs to overcome obstacles when needed.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- **Wheeled robots** use significantly less energy than legged robots on flat surfaces, but this advantage decreases on complex terrain where legs can navigate more efficiently.\n- Wheels work best on smooth, continuous surfaces like floors and roads, while legs excel at handling stairs, gaps, and uneven terrain.\n- Robot design involves balancing **speed** (favoring wheels) and **versatility** (favoring legs), with the optimal choice depending on the operating environment.\n---keytakeawaysEND---",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
