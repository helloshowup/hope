Now, let's examine YOUR eating habits and set some personal nutrition goals that will help fuel your activities and make you feel fantastic!\n\n## Lesson Objectives\nAfter this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Figure out what's working (and what's not) in your current eating habits\n- Create your own personal nutrition goals that make sense for YOU\n- Develop a simple plan to make healthier food choices that fit your life\n- Overcome common challenges that might get in your way\n\n## Activity: Food Detective Work\nTime to become nutrition detectives and investigate our own eating habits!\n\n**Step 1: Food Tracking (1 day)**\n- Track everything you eat and drink for ONE day using our \"Food Detective\" worksheet\n- Write down WHAT you ate, WHEN you ate it, and HOW you felt afterward\n- Don't worry about counting calories or being perfect - just be honest!\n\n**Step 2: Food Group Analysis**\n- Look at your food log and sort your foods into the MyPlate categories:\n  * Fruits: How many different colours did you eat?\n  * Vegetables: Did you get at least 3 servings?\n  * Grains: Were they mostly whole grains?\n  * Protein: Did you have protein at most meals?\n  * Dairy/Calcium-rich foods: Did you include these?\n- Circle foods that gave you energy and put a star next to foods that made you feel sluggish\n\n**Step 3: Goal Setting**\n- Based on your food detective work, choose ONE area you want to improve\n- Create a specific, doable goal using our \"SMART Goal Builder\":\n  * Example: \"I will add a fruit or vegetable to my after-school snack at least 4 days this week\"\n  * NOT: \"I will eat healthier\" (too vague!)\n- Share your goal with a partner who can help keep you on track\n\n## Common Challenges and Solutions\nMiddle school life can make healthy eating tricky! Here are some real solutions:\n\n**Challenge: No time because of homework and activities**\n- Solution: Create a \"Grab & Go\" snack box with healthy options you can take anywhere\n- Solution: Prep simple snacks on the weekend (like cutting up veggies or portioning trail mix)\n\n**Challenge: Limited access to kitchen or cooking tools**\n- Solution: Learn these no-cook power snacks: apple + peanut butter, yoghurt parfait, veggie wraps\n- Solution: Keep a water bottle with you to stay hydrated without needing a kitchen\n\n**Challenge: Weather keeps you inside**\n- Solution: Indoor movement breaks (5-minute dance party, quick stretching)\n- Solution: Fuel indoor activities with brain-boosting foods like nuts, berries, and whole grains\n\n**Challenge: Just not feeling motivated**\n- Solution: Team up with a friend to try one new healthy food each week\n- Solution: Notice how different foods affect your energy for activities you enjoy\n- Solution: Create a fun chart to track your progress and celebrate small wins\n\n## Action Plan\nNow it's time to put your goal into action!\n\n1. Fill out your \"Nutrition Action Plan\" worksheet:\n   - Write your SMART goal at the top\n   - List 3 specific actions you'll take this week\n   - Identify who can support you (friend, family member, teacher)\n   - Plan how you'll track your progress (chart, journal, app)\n\n2. Buddy Check-In:\n   - Share your plan with a partner\n   - Give each other feedback and suggestions\n   - Schedule a time to catch up with each other later this week\n\n## Over to You\nThink about how the foods you eat affect how you feel during the day. When do you feel most energised? When do you feel tired? What patterns do you notice about your eating habits? Write down two things you learned about yourself from this food detective work.\n\n## Conclusion\nRemember, making small changes to your eating habits can have a BIG impact on how you feel and perform in sports, school, and life! Next class, we'll learn about the FITT Principle, which will help you design your own personal fitness plan. Your nutrition goals from today will work together with your fitness plan to help you feel your best!\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a lesson on nutrition analysis and planning for a physical education course. It covers the following key elements:\n\n- Learning objectives for the session\n- An activity to track and analyze personal eating habits using the MyPlate food groups\n- Goal-setting using the SMART framework to improve one nutrition-related behavior\n- Strategies for overcoming common challenges to healthy eating\n- An action planning worksheet to put the nutrition goal into practice\n- Reflection questions to connect the lesson to personal experiences\n\nThe content is structured with clear section headings, learning objectives, step-by-step instructions, and supporting visuals/worksheets. It aims to empower students to take ownership of their nutrition habits and make sustainable improvements.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nBased on the provided enhancement prompt, the key objectives are:\n\n1. **Structural Integrity (Critical)**: Maintain all original section headings, sequence, and numbering exactly as written, with the exception of removing the \"Introduction\" heading.\n2. **Content Adaptation (Important)**: Convert all group activities to individual activities, replace teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions, adapt classroom/equipment references to home environment options, and convert timed components to self-paced elements.\n3. **Assessment Adaptation (Supporting)**: Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms.\n\nThe goal is to preserve the original content's structural integrity while transforming it into an effective asynchronous online learning experience.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an online physical education course at Excel Middle School. Key considerations for this learner profile include:\n\n- Reading Level: Content should be adapted to a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday language, active voice, and short sentences.\n- Prior Knowledge: Students may have varying exposure to formal physical education, so concepts and instructions should be clear and accessible.\n- Learning Styles: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities will be most effective.\n- Equipment/Space: Adaptations should be provided for common household items and limited home spaces, with a focus on safety and minimal noise impact.\n\nThe content should be engaging, relatable, and provide a sense of agency for the learners to take ownership of their nutrition goals.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nAs this content is being transformed for asynchronous online delivery, the following limitations and considerations apply:\n\n- No peer interaction or teacher facilitation is available, so all activities must be self-guided.\n- Timed components or synchronous elements need to be converted to self-paced formats.\n- Assessments and feedback mechanisms must be adapted for independent completion.\n- Visual elements, clear instructions, and structured \"chunks\" of information will be crucial for effective online learning.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. **Maintain Educational Integrity**: Preserve the core learning objectives, activity flow, and instructional value of the original content.\n2. **Address Enhancement Prompt**: Ensure all structural, content, and assessment adaptations specified in the prompt are implemented effectively.\n3. **Preserve Original Content Value**: Avoid drastically altering the original intent or removing valuable elements; focus on transforming for the online medium.\n4. **Adapt for Target Learner**: Tailor the language, examples, and complexity to the 11-14 year old audience while maintaining educational rigor.\n5. **Optimize for Online Delivery**: Leverage best practices for asynchronous online learning, including visual aids, clear instructions, and self-paced activities.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. **Maintain Structural Integrity**: Keep all original section headings, sequence, and numbering as specified in the prompt, except for removing the \"Introduction\" heading.\n2. **Convert Group Activities**: Adapt any group-based activities to individual, self-guided formats, providing clear step-by-step instructions.\n3. **Replace Teacher Facilitation**: Rewrite teacher-led elements as self-directed instructions, maintaining the original intent and learning objectives.\n4. **Adapt Classroom References**: Modify any references to classroom spaces, equipment, or resources to options suitable for a home environment.\n5. **Convert Timed Components**: Transform any timed or synchronous components into self-paced formats, allowing learners to progress at their own speed.\n6. **Reinforce Assessments**: Convert assessment sections into brief reinforcement paragraphs or self-evaluation mechanisms, preserving the original learning objectives.\n7. **Enhance Visuals and Formatting**: Incorporate more visual aids, diagrams, and formatting best practices to support the online learning experience.\n8. **Maintain Tone and Engagement**: Preserve the conversational, friendly tone and relatable, middle-school appropriate examples to keep students engaged.\n9. **Emphasize Safety and Adaptability**: Provide clear safety guidelines, warm-up/cool-down instructions, and modifications for different physical abilities and home environments.\n10. **Review and Refine**: Thoroughly review the transformed content to ensure it meets all requirements in the enhancement prompt and effectively serves the target learner profile.\n\nThis preparatory context provides a comprehensive framework to guide the subsequent content enhancement process, ensuring the original educational value is preserved while adapting the material for effective asynchronous online delivery to the 11-14 year old target audience.",
