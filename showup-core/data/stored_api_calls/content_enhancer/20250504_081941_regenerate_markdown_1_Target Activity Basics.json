Transforming outdoor games for indoor play keeps the fun going whatever the weather. With a few clever tweaks, you can adapt your favourite games to fit your classroom or bedroom using everyday items from around your home. These indoor versions help develop accuracy, focus, and hand-eye coordination—skills that transfer to many sports and daily activities.\n\n## Principles of Game Modification\nWhen adapting games for indoor play, consider these three key factors:\n\n1. **Space**: Indoor areas are smaller than outdoor fields or courts. You'll need to shrink the playing area to fit inside a classroom, hallway, or living room.\n\n2. **Equipment**: Rather than using standard sports equipment, opt for softer, lighter alternatives that won't damage anything indoors. Rolled-up socks make brilliant substitutes for balls!\n\n3. **Rules**: Adjust the rules to suit a smaller space with different equipment. This might mean fewer players, simpler scoring, or creative new ways to play.\n\nBy tweaking these three elements, you can transform almost any outdoor game into an indoor adventure!\n\n## Adapted Game Examples\n\n### Mini-Basketball\n**What you'll need:**\n- A small, soft ball (or rolled-up socks)\n- A rubbish bin, laundry basket, or box\n- Masking tape to mark the shooting line\n\n**How to play:**\n1. Place your \"basket\" against a wall or in a corner\n2. Use tape to mark shooting lines at different distances\n3. Take turns shooting from each line\n4. Score 1 point for close shots, 2 points for medium distance, and 3 points for far shots\n5. The first player to reach 15 points wins!\n\n**Skills you'll develop:** Shooting accuracy, judging distance, focus\n\n### Hallway Bowling\n**What you'll need:**\n- 6-10 empty plastic bottles or toilet paper rolls\n- A soft ball or rolled-up socks\n- Masking tape to mark the rolling line\n\n**How to play:**\n1. Set up your \"pins\" at one end of a hallway or clear space\n2. Mark a rolling line with tape about 3-5 metres away\n3. Roll your ball toward the pins, trying to knock down as many as possible\n4. Each player gets two rolls per turn\n5. Keep track of how many pins you knock down in each frame\n6. Play 10 frames like in regular bowling\n\n**Skills you'll develop:** Rolling accuracy, control of force, aiming\n\n### Sock Volleyball\n**What you'll need:**\n- A rolled-up pair of socks or soft, lightweight ball\n- String, yarn, or masking tape for a \"net\"\n- Chairs or other furniture to support the net (if using string/yarn)\n\n**How to play:**\n1. Create a net by stretching string between two chairs or making a line on the floor with tape\n2. Divide into two teams, one on each side of the net\n3. Use your hands to hit the sock ball back and forth over the net\n4. Each team can hit the ball up to three times before sending it over\n5. Score a point when the other team can't return the ball or hits it out of bounds\n6. Play to 15 points, winning by at least 2 points\n\n**Skills you'll develop:** Hand-eye coordination, teamwork, reaction time\n\n## Benefits of Adapting Games for Indoor Play\nPlaying adapted indoor games offers loads of advantages:\n\n- **Play anytime**: Stay active even during horrible weather\n- **Use what you have**: No need for fancy equipment—just everyday items from around your home\n- **Build valuable skills**: Improve your accuracy, focus, and coordination while having a laugh\n- **Get creative**: Invent your own game adaptations and rules\n- **Include everyone**: These modified games often work better for players of different abilities\n\n## Safety Considerations\nTo stay safe while playing indoor games:\n\n- Clear the area of breakable items or tripping hazards\n- Use soft objects that won't hurt if they hit someone or break something\n- Establish boundaries to prevent bumping into walls or furniture\n- Take turns and give each other enough space\n- Use indoor voices and movements (no shouting or running)\n- Always get permission from an adult before playing\n\n## Conclusion\nWith a bit of creativity, you can bring the excitement of outdoor games inside! By adjusting the space, equipment, and rules, nearly any game can become an indoor activity. These modified games help develop important physical skills while keeping boredom at bay, whatever the weather. Next time you're stuck indoors, try one of these adapted games or invent your own version of your favourite activity!\n\n## Over to You\n1. What's your favourite outdoor game, and how could you adapt it to play indoors?\n2. Which skills do you think you'd improve most by playing these adapted games?\n3. What household items could you use to create your own indoor target game?\n4. Why is it important to be able to adapt games for different environments?\n\n## Extension Activities\n- Design your own indoor adaptation of a traditional sport\n- Create a scoring system for your adapted game\n- Teach your adapted game to a family member\n- Make a poster showing the rules of your favourite indoor game\n</Edited Text>\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
