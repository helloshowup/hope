  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an introductory orientation module for students enrolling in Excel High School's asynchronous online learning program. It provides an overview of the orientation's purpose, the school's mission and values, and the key topics covered throughout the 12-section orientation. The content aims to prepare students for success in Excel High School's self-paced, virtual learning environment.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\n- Replace the existing mission and vision statements with the exact versions from the Student Handbook\n- Include the official core values of the school\n- Add a new section that introduces key personal qualities for online learning success, such as responsibility, perseverance, critical thinking, and self-direction\n- Recontextualize the reflection questions to refer to both the institutional values and the student's own learning habits\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\n- The target learners are middle and high school students (ages 11-18) enrolled full- or part-time in Excel High School's accredited, asynchronous online program.\n- Students have varying levels of academic preparation, digital literacy, and access to technology. Many are balancing academics with other commitments and require flexibility.\n- Content should use plain language with short sentences, aim for a 5th-6th grade reading level for younger students, and progressively increase in complexity for high schoolers.\n- Visual elements, interactive tools, and engaging examples are particularly effective for maintaining student interest and comprehension.\n- Content must reflect global awareness and avoid region-specific assumptions to accommodate Excel High School's diverse, internationally distributed student population.\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\n- All courses at Excel High School are asynchronous and self-paced, requiring students to work independently and manage their own schedules.\n- Students complete coursework from home or other informal settings, so content must be adaptable to varying physical learning spaces and equipment availability.\n- Flexibility is key, as students need to be able to engage with the material with minimal materials and in small or shared spaces.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Maintain the core purpose of the orientation in preparing students for success in Excel High School's online learning environment.\n- Preserve the original content's structure and flow while enhancing it to better align with the school's official mission, vision, and values.\n- Ensure the language, examples, and complexity level are appropriate for the target middle and high school student audience.\n- Emphasize the importance of personal qualities and habits for thriving in self-paced, asynchronous online learning.\n\n# Suggested Approach\n- Replace the existing mission and vision statements with the exact versions from the Student Handbook.\n- Incorporate the school's official core values into the content.\n- Add a new section that introduces key personal qualities for online learning success, such as responsibility, perseverance, critical thinking, and self-direction. Title this section appropriately (e.g., \"Habits for Online Learning Success\" or \"Student Success Principles\").\n- Recontextualize the reflection questions to refer to both the institutional values and the student's own learning habits.\n- Maintain the original content structure while simplifying language, adding more visual elements, and ensuring global relevance to better meet the needs of the target learners.\n- Avoid overly prescriptive formatting or structural changes unless specifically requested in the enhancement prompt.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
