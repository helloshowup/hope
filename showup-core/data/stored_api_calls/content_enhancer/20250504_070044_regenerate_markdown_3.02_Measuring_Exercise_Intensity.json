You'll discover different exercises that use your body as resistance, learn proper form to stay safe, and find out how to adjust exercises based on your fitness level. By the end, you'll be confident enough to create simple bodyweight workouts you can do anywhere - whether that's at home, the park, or even your bedroom!\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Explain at least three benefits of bodyweight training in your own words\n- Demonstrate 5-6 basic bodyweight exercises with proper form\n- Modify exercises to make them easier or harder depending on your fitness level\n- Create a simple 10-minute bodyweight circuit you can do at home\n\nWho's done a push-up or squat before? These are classic bodyweight exercises - movements that use your own body as resistance instead of dumbbells or machines.\n\nSome interesting facts about bodyweight training:\n- Gymnasts build incredible strength mainly through bodyweight exercises\n- You can do it anywhere - no gym membership needed!\n- It improves strength and flexibility while getting your heart rate up\n- Many pro athletes include bodyweight training in their routines\n- It's perfect for staying fit when you're stuck indoors or have no equipment\n\nThink about why it might be handy to know exercises you can do without equipment. Maybe when you're travelling, can't go outside, or don't have access to a gym?\n\n## Warm-up (5-10 minutes)\nA good warm-up gets your blood flowing and prepares your muscles. Complete these exercises at your own pace:\n- Jumping jacks (about 30 seconds, or until you feel warm)\n- Arm circles (about 15 seconds forward, 15 seconds backward)\n- High knees in place (about 30 seconds, go at your own speed)\n- Bodyweight squats (10 slow squats)\n- Shoulder rolls (10 forward, 10 backward)\n\nWarming up matters because it:\n- Gets blood pumping to your muscles\n- Makes your muscles more flexible and reduces injury risk\n- Gets your body and mind ready for the workout ahead\n\n## Bodyweight Exercises (20-25 minutes)\nFor each exercise, focus on doing it properly rather than quickly. Try the easier version if you're new to this, or the challenging version if you want to push yourself. Take breaks whenever you need to:\n\n1. **Push-ups**\n   - Easier: Push-ups against a wall or with knees on the ground\n   - Standard: Regular push-ups with good form\n   - Harder: Push-ups with feet elevated on a step or sturdy chair\n\n2. **Squats**\n   - Easier: Squat to a chair or couch\n   - Standard: Regular bodyweight squats\n   - Harder: Jump squats or single-leg squats\n\n3. **Planks**\n   - Easier: Planks from knees or against a wall\n   - Standard: Full plank position for as long as comfortable (aim for 20-30 seconds)\n   - Harder: Plank with alternating leg lifts\n\n4. **Lunges**\n   - Easier: Stationary lunges holding onto a wall or chair for support\n   - Standard: Walking lunges (if you have space) or stationary lunges\n   - Harder: Reverse lunges or jumping lunges\n\n5. **Superman Holds** (for back strength)\n   - Easier: Alternating arm and leg raises\n   - Standard: Full superman hold for 10-15 seconds\n   - Harder: Superman with arm and leg pulses\n\nRemember these key points:\n- Keep breathing! Many people hold their breath without realising\n- Focus on form rather than quantity\n- If something hurts (not just feels challenging), stop and try an easier version\n- It's normal for exercises to feel tough at first - that's how you build strength!\n\n## Create Your Own Circuit (15 minutes)\nNow it's time to create your own simple 4-exercise circuit using the bodyweight exercises you've just practiced. Your circuit should:\n- Include at least one exercise for upper body, lower body, and core\n- Have exercises performed for about 30 seconds each with 15-30 seconds rest between (adjust as needed)\n- Include at least one modification to make an exercise easier or harder based on your fitness level\n\nTake 5-7 minutes to plan your circuit. Write down your exercises and try them out in your space. Make sure you have enough room to move safely.\n\n## Cool-down and Over to You (5-10 minutes)\nTry these gentle stretching exercises at your own pace:\n- Reach for the sky, then touch toes (or as far as comfortable) (10 seconds each)\n- Gentle arm across chest stretch (15 seconds each arm)\n- Quad stretch holding one foot behind you (use a wall for balance if needed) (15 seconds each leg)\n- Butterfly stretch for inner thighs (20 seconds)\n\nWhile stretching, think about:\n- Which exercise did you find most challenging today? Why?\n- How could you use these exercises at home?\n- What's one thing you discovered about bodyweight training today?\n- When might bodyweight exercises be more useful than using gym equipment?\n\n## Assessment\nTake a moment to reflect on your workout:\n- How was your form during the exercises? Did you maintain proper posture?\n- Did you choose appropriate modifications based on your fitness level?\n- Were you able to complete most of the exercises?\n- Did you create a balanced circuit with different types of exercises?\n\nTo reinforce what you've learned, write down or think about:\n1. Three bodyweight exercises you learned today\n2. One way you could make each exercise easier or harder\n3. One time or place you could do bodyweight training in your daily life",

These classic bodyweight exercises use your own body as resistance instead of weights or machines.\n\nBodyweight training has several cool aspects:\n- Gymnasts develop their impressive strength mostly through bodyweight exercises\n- You can exercise anywhere without special equipment\n- It builds strength and flexibility while also giving you a cardio workout\n- Many professional athletes regularly do bodyweight exercises\n- It works perfectly when you're stuck inside or don't have equipment\n\nWhen might knowing these exercises come in handy? Perhaps during bad weather, while traveling, or when you can't get to a gym.\n\n## Warm-up (5-10 minutes)\nA proper warm-up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles. Go through these exercises at your own pace:\n- Jumping jacks (about 30 seconds, or until you feel warm)\n- Arm circles (about 15 seconds forward, 15 seconds backward)\n- High knees in place (about 30 seconds, go at your own speed)\n- Bodyweight squats (10 slow squats)\n- Shoulder rolls (10 forward, 10 backward)\n\nWarming up is important because it:\n- Sends blood to your muscles\n- Increases muscle flexibility and helps prevent injuries\n- Prepares both your body and mind for exercise\n\n## Bodyweight Exercises (20-25 minutes)\nFor each exercise, focus on proper form rather than speed. Start with the easier version if you're new to exercise, or try the challenging version if you want more difficulty. Rest whenever needed:\n\n1. **Push-ups**\n   - Easier: Push-ups against a wall or with knees on the ground\n   - Standard: Regular push-ups with good form\n   - Harder: Push-ups with feet elevated on a step or sturdy chair\n\n2. **Squats**\n   - Easier: Squat to a chair or couch\n   - Standard: Regular bodyweight squats\n   - Harder: Jump squats or single-leg squats\n\n3. **Planks**\n   - Easier: Planks from knees or against a wall\n   - Standard: Full plank position for as long as comfortable (aim for 20-30 seconds)\n   - Harder: Plank with alternating leg lifts\n\n4. **Lunges**\n   - Easier: Stationary lunges holding onto a wall or chair for support\n   - Standard: Walking lunges (if you have space) or stationary lunges\n   - Harder: Reverse lunges or jumping lunges\n\n5. **Superman Holds** (for back strength)\n   - Easier: Alternating arm and leg raises\n   - Standard: Full superman hold for 10-15 seconds\n   - Harder: Superman with arm and leg pulses\n\nImportant reminders:\n- Don't forget to breathe regularly during exercises\n- Good form matters more than doing lots of repetitions\n- Stop if you feel pain (not just the challenge of the exercise)\n- Exercises often feel difficult at first - that's normal and part of getting stronger\n\n## Create Your Own Circuit (15 minutes)\nNow create your own simple 4-exercise circuit using the bodyweight exercises you've practiced. Your circuit should:\n- Include at least one exercise for upper body, lower body, and core\n- Have exercises performed for about 30 seconds each with 15-30 seconds rest between (adjust as needed)\n- Include at least one modification to make an exercise easier or harder based on your fitness level\n\nSpend 5-7 minutes planning your circuit. Write down your exercises and test them in your space. Check that you have enough room to move safely.\n\n## Cool-down and Over to You (5-10 minutes)\nDo these gentle stretching exercises at your own pace:\n- Reach for the sky, then touch toes (or as far as comfortable) (10 seconds each)\n- Gentle arm across chest stretch (15 seconds each arm)\n- Quad stretch holding one foot behind you (use a wall for balance if needed) (15 seconds each leg)\n- Butterfly stretch for inner thighs (20 seconds)\n\nDuring your stretching, consider:\n- Which exercise challenged you the most today? Why?\n- How could you use these exercises at home?\n- What's one thing you discovered about bodyweight training today?\n- When might bodyweight exercises be more useful than using gym equipment?\n\n## Assessment\nTake a moment to reflect on your workout:\n- How was your form during the exercises?
