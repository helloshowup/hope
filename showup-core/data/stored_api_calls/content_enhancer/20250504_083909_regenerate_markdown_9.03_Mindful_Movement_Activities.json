Predictable comparison structures (\"think of X as Y\", \"imagine X is Y\")\n2. Overused intensifiers and generic language\n3. Formulaic transition phrases\n4. Artificial enthusiasm markers\n5. Repetitive explanation patterns\n\n## REFINEMENT REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - Preserve all educational substance and learning objectives\n   - Maintain the overall document structure and organization\n   \n2. PATTERN ELIMINATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks\n   - Substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions\n   - Convert formulaic transitions to natural connections\n   - Replace artificial excitement markers with inherently interesting content\n   - Eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clichés\n   \n3. AUTHENTIC VOICE ENHANCEMENT (SUPPORTING):\n   - Vary sentence structure and length throughout\n   - Replace generic explanations with specific examples\n   - Add natural language variations and conversational elements\n   - Create authentic progression between ideas\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Maintain exact section headings and structural elements\n2. Focus exclusively on language patterns and voice authenticity\n3. Preserve all educational substance while enhancing authenticity\n4. Prioritize natural, varied expression over formulaic patterns\n\nThis refinement creates more authentic, engaging educational content while maintaining perfect structural and educational integrity.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on \"Mindful Movement Activities\" for a physical education course. It covers various ways for middle school students to stay active in their local communities, including free or low-cost options. The module provides information on different places to be active, how to find community resources, and tips for creating a personal activity plan.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n\n1. STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain all original section headings exactly as written\n   - Preserve the educational substance and learning objectives\n   - Maintain the overall document structure and organization\n\n2. PATTERN ELIMINATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks\n   - Substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions\n   - Convert formulaic transitions to natural connections\n   - Replace artificial enthusiasm markers with inherently interesting content\n   - Eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clichés \n\n3. AUTHENTIC VOICE ENHANCEMENT (SUPPORTING):\n   - Vary sentence structure and length throughout\n   - Replace generic explanations with specific examples\n   - Add natural language variations and conversational elements\n   - Create authentic progression between ideas\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience for this content is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an asynchronous online physical education course. Key adaptations needed include:\n\n- Use 5th-6th grade reading level language and sentence structure\n- Employ active voice, direct instructions, and familiar everyday words\n- Break content into clear, visually-distinct \"chunks\" with frequent headings\n- Include relevant images, diagrams, and visual examples for each new concept\n- Connect to real-world examples and use a friendly, conversational tone\n- Provide alternatives using common household items for equipment/space\n- Emphasize safety considerations and offer modified versions of activities\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content will be delivered through an asynchronous online learning platform, with no opportunities for peer interaction. As such, the content must be self-contained, with all necessary information and support provided directly within the material.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Preserve the original educational substance, learning objectives, and structural integrity\n- Eliminate predictable language patterns and artificial enthusiasm to create a more authentic voice\n- Adapt content to the appropriate reading level, language, and visual style for the target middle school audience\n- Provide clear, specific alternatives for equipment and space constraints due to the online, at-home nature of the learning\n\n# Suggested Approach\nBegin by carefully reviewing the current content to identify any predictable comparison structures, generic language, formulaic transitions, artificial enthusiasm markers, and repetitive explanation patterns. Systematically replace these elements with more natural, varied language that maintains the original educational substance.\n\nWhen adapting the content for the target learners, focus on using simple, direct language; breaking information into clear, visually-distinct sections; and incorporating relevant images, diagrams, and examples. Ensure all safety considerations and equipment/space alternatives are explicitly provided.\n\nThroughout the enhancement, preserve the original section headings, learning objectives, and overall organizational structure. Strive to create an engaging, authentic learning experience that empowers middle school students to discover and pursue physical activities in their local communities.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
