How do you feel after you've been active?\n\n## Setting Goals That Grow With You\n\nAs you get older, your fitness goals will change. Here are three types of goals you can set:\n\n### 1. Performance Goals\nThese goals focus on what your body can do.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Run a mile without stopping\n* Do 10 push-ups with good form\n* Touch your toes while sitting\n* Jump rope for 2 minutes\n\n![Diagram: Simple illustrations showing proper form for push-ups with labelled body positions]\n\n### 2. Process Goals\nThese goals focus on how often you move.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Be active for 60 minutes every day\n* Try a new physical activity each month\n* Walk the dog three times a week\n* Stretch for 10 minutes before bed\n\n### 3. Health Goals\nThese goals focus on how you feel.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Have more energy during the day\n* Sleep better at night\n* Feel less stressed\n* Improve your posture (how you sit and stand)\n\n**Over to You:** Circle one goal from each category that interests you most!\n\n## Your Lifetime Fitness Vision\n\nThink about how you want to stay active as you grow up. Your vision can include:\n\n### Middle School (Now)\nWhat activities do you enjoy now? What new skills do you want to learn?\n\n### High School (A few years from now)\nWhat sports or activities might you want to try? How will you stay active when schoolwork gets busier?\n\n### Adult Life (Many years from now)\nHow will you stay active when you have a job? What activities can you do your whole life?\n\n![Image: Three simple illustrations showing people of different ages being active in different ways]\n\n## Create Your Fitness Timeline\n\nFollow these steps to create your own fitness timeline:\n\n1. Draw a line across a piece of paper.\n2. Mark three points: \"Now,\" \"High School,\" and \"Adult.\"\n3. At each point, write or draw:\n   * One activity you want to do\n   * One performance goal\n   * One process goal\n   * One health goal\n\n**Safety Tip:** Remember that goals should challenge you but not hurt you. Always start small and build up slowly!\n\n## Try It At Home\n\n### Materials You Need:\n* Paper and pencil or markers\n* Small space to move around (even a bedroom works!)\n* No special equipment needed\n\n### Activity: Fitness Vision Board\n1. Find pictures in magazines or draw images that show activities you want to do throughout your life.\n2. Arrange these pictures on paper to create a vision board (a poster with pictures of your goals).\n3. Add words that describe how you want to feel when you're active.\n4. Share your vision board with a family member and explain your fitness goals.\n\n**Space Tip:** If you don't have much room at home, focus on activities that need little space, like yoga, dancing, or bodyweight exercises (exercises using just your body weight).\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nStaying active throughout your life is one of the most valuable things you can do for your body and mind. By setting goals that can change as you grow, you're building healthy habits that will help you feel good for many years to come.\n\n**Remember:** The best fitness plan is one you enjoy and can stick with!\n\n## Check Your Understanding\n* Name one benefit of staying active throughout your life.\n* What's the difference between a performance goal and a process goal?\n* Why might your fitness goals change as you get older?\n* What's one activity you could enjoy doing your whole life?\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on the importance of lifelong fitness and how to set appropriate fitness goals. It covers the benefits of staying active, different types of fitness goals, and guidance for creating a personalized fitness vision and timeline. The content is structured with clear learning objectives, explanatory sections, visual elements, and interactive reflection prompts.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain all original section headings exactly as written, except remove the \"## Introduction\" heading\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n\n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all group activities to individual activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n\n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) with varying exposure to physical education concepts. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Reading level at 5th-6th grade on the Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Use of everyday language, active voice, and short sentences\n- Incorporation of visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities\n- Adaptation for limited access to specialized equipment and varying home spaces\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed from a classroom-based format to asynchronous online learning. Key considerations include:\n\n- Conversion of all group activities to individual, self-guided activities\n- Replacement of teacher-led facilitation with clear, step-by-step instructions\n- Adaptation of timed components to self-paced elements\n- Conversion of assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Maintain the core educational value and integrity of the original content\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Incorporate engaging visual elements, storytelling, and real-world connections to support the target learners\n- Provide clear safety guidelines, equipment alternatives, and space considerations for the home environment\n- Preserve the original structure and sequence of content to maintain educational progression\n\n# Suggested Approach\n1. Begin by removing the \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content.\n2. Carefully review each section to identify group activities, teacher-led elements, timed components, and location-specific references.\n3. Convert group activities to individual, self-guided activities with clear instructions.\n4. Replace teacher-led facilitation with step-by-step guidance for independent completion.\n5. Adapt timed components to self-paced elements, allowing learners to progress at their own pace.\n6. Modify any references to classroom spaces, equipment, or peer interactions to align with the home environment and independent learning format.\n7. Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs that provide immediate feedback and opportunities for self-reflection.\n8. Maintain the original section headings, sequence, and numbering to preserve the educational structure.\n9. Review the content for appropriate language, examples, and complexity based on the 5th-6th grade reading level.\n10. Incorporate engaging visual elements, storytelling, and real-world connections to support the target learners.\n11. Provide clear safety guidelines, equipment alternatives, and space considerations to enable effective independent learning in the home environment.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
