This is where loops come in handy. A loop is a programming structure that repeats a set of commands multiple times.\n\nUsing our square path example, instead of writing out the same commands repeatedly, we could use a loop:\n\n```\nRepeat 4 times:\n    move_forward(10)\n    turn_right(90)\n```\n\nThis loop accomplishes the same square path but with much less code. Loops are especially useful for repetitive movements like walking (where leg motions repeat) or for tasks that need to be done multiple times.\n\nConditions add another level of intelligence to robot movement. A condition is a programming structure that makes decisions based on certain criteria, usually written as \"if-then\" statements:\n\n```\nif (obstacle_detected) then\n    turn_right(90)\nelse\n    move_forward(5)\n```\n\nWith conditions, robots can adapt their movements based on what's happening around them. This is crucial for creating robots that can navigate real-world environments where unexpected obstacles or situations might arise.\n\nBy combining basic commands with loops and conditions, we can create surprisingly complex and adaptive movement behaviors - from simple line-following robots to machines that can navigate mazes or avoid obstacles.\n\n## **Connecting Sensors to Movement**\nFor robots to move intelligently in the real world, they need to sense their environment and adjust their movements accordingly.\n\n### **Responsive Movement Behaviors**\nResponsive movement means a robot can change what it's doing based on what it senses around it. This is what makes the difference between a robot that blindly follows commands and one that can adapt to its environment.\n\nFor example, a line-following robot uses light sensors to detect a dark line on a light surface. When the sensor detects it's moving off the line, the robot adjusts its direction to stay on track. This creates a responsive behavior where the robot continuously corrects its path based on sensor input.\n\nAnother example is a robot vacuum that uses bump sensors to detect walls and furniture. When it bumps into something, it changes direction to avoid the obstacle and continue cleaning. Some advanced models even use distance sensors to slow down before they hit obstacles.\n\nThese responsive behaviors make robots much more useful in unpredictable environments. Instead of needing perfect instructions for every possible situation, the robot can make decisions on its own based on what it senses.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Loops help robots repeat the same commands multiple times, making it easier to program movements like drawing a square without writing the same instructions over and over.\n- Conditions (if-then statements) allow robots to make decisions based on what they sense, helping them adapt to their environment instead of just following fixed commands.\n- Responsive robots use sensors to adjust their movements in real-time, like following a line or avoiding obstacles, which makes them useful in unpredictable real-world situations.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an introduction to the use of loops and conditions in programming robot movements.
