The robot uses special adhesive pads inspired by gecko feet, which have millions of tiny hairs that create a molecular attraction to surfaces. These robots could someday help with building inspections or window cleaning on skyscrapers!\n\n**Salamander-Inspired Amphibious Robot**: Researchers in Switzerland built a robot called \"Pleurobot\" that can both walk on land and swim in water just like a salamander. By carefully studying salamander skeletons and movements, they created a robot that smoothly transitions between environments - perfect for monitoring lakes and shorelines.\n\n**Kangaroo-Inspired Jumping Robot**: Engineers at Festo created \"BionicKangaroo,\" a robot that captures the energy-efficient jumping motion of real kangaroos. The robot stores energy from each landing to power its next jump, just like real kangaroos do. This energy-saving technique could help create more efficient robots for package delivery or exploration.\n\nThese examples show how studying nature's solutions can lead to breakthrough technologies that might not have been discovered through traditional engineering approaches.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about an animal that moves in an interesting way. How might its movement strategy solve a robot design challenge? Consider the unique aspects of that animal's locomotion and how those principles could address specific robotic movement problems.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n## **Basic Movement Programming**\nNow that we understand how robots can be designed to move like animals, let's explore how we actually tell robots to move using programming.\n\n### **Movement Commands and Sequences**\nProgramming a robot to move starts with basic commands - the simple instructions that control individual actions. These are like the building blocks of robot movement. Common movement commands include:\n\n- move_forward(distance)\n- turn_left(degrees)\n- turn_right(degrees)\n- stop()\n- set_speed(value)\n\nThese commands by themselves only create very simple movements. To make a robot perform useful tasks, we need to combine these commands into sequences - ordered lists of instructions that the robot follows one after another.\n\nFor example, to make a robot navigate around a square path, we might create this sequence:\n1. move_forward(10)\n2. turn_right(90)\n3. move_forward(10)\n4. turn_right(90)\n5. move_forward(10)\n6. turn_right(90)\n7. move_forward(10)\n\nWhen the robot follows this sequence, it will trace a square pattern. By changing the order of commands or adding new ones, we can create an endless variety of movement patterns. Think of it like a dance routine - each step must be performed in the right order to create the complete dance.\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots can copy animal movements to solve problems, like gecko-inspired robots that climb walls and salamander robots that walk and swim.\n- Programming robot movement uses simple commands (like move_forward and turn_right) combined in sequences to create patterns, similar to steps in a dance routine.\n- Studying how animals move in nature helps engineers create breakthrough technologies they might not discover through traditional methods.\n---keytakeawaysEND---",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
