They might include users who will directly interact with your robot, people who will benefit from its work, and even those who might be worried about its operation.\n\nTo identify stakeholders, ask yourself questions like:\n- Who will use the robot?\n- Who will benefit from the robot's actions?\n- Who might be worried about the robot operating in their space?\n- Who will maintain or fix the robot?\n\nFor example, if you're designing a robot to help in a school cafeteria, stakeholders might include students, cafeteria staff, custodians, and school administrators.\n\nOnce you've identified stakeholders, you need to understand what they really need. This might involve:\n- Talking with potential users\n- Watching how things work now\n- Sending out surveys\n- Creating user personas (made-up characters that represent different types of users)\n\nUnderstanding these needs helps make sure your robot will actually be useful and accepted by the people it's designed to help.\n\n### **Setting Constraints and Requirements**\n\n**Constraints** are the limitations your solution must work within. They might include:\n\n- Physical constraints: size, weight, or the environment where the robot will operate\n- Technical constraints: available power sources, materials, or technology\n- Time constraints: deadlines for completion or how quickly the robot must perform tasks\n- Budget constraints: how much money is available for building and maintaining the robot\n- Safety constraints: making sure the robot won't harm people or property\n\n**Requirements** are the specific things your solution must do or have. For example:\n- The robot must be able to climb stairs\n- The robot must operate for at least 3 hours on a single charge\n- The robot must be controllable by someone with limited hand mobility\n\nClearly defining these constraints and requirements early helps prevent wasted effort on solutions that won't work in the real world. They act as guardrails for your creativity, keeping your ideas practical and doable.\n\n## **Activity 1: Problem Definition Workshop**\n\nTry writing problem statements for given robotics scenarios using a structured template. For each scenario, identify the affected stakeholders, list the constraints, and define success criteria. Complete at least two scenario exercises to build your problem definition skills.\n\n## **Problem Analysis Techniques**\n\nOnce you've identified a problem, it's important to dig deeper to fully understand it. Just like a doctor doesn't give medicine without first figuring out what's wrong, we shouldn't jump to solutions without thoroughly analyzing the problem.\n\n### **Root Cause Analysis**\n\nRoot cause analysis helps us look beyond the symptoms of a problem to find what's really causing it. Two popular techniques for this are:\n\nThe **\"5 Whys\"** technique involves asking \"why\" repeatedly to dig deeper into a problem. For example:\n- Why is the hallway delivery robot stopping unexpectedly? Because its sensors detect obstacles.\n- Why are sensors detecting obstacles when none are visible? Because reflections from the floor tiles are confusing the sensors.\n- Why are reflections causing confusion? Because the sensor algorithm can't tell the difference between real obstacles and reflections.\n- Why can't the algorithm tell these apart? Because it was programmed for dull surfaces, not shiny floors.\n- Why was it programmed this way? Because the original testing environment had different flooring.\n\nBy the fifth \"why,\" we've found a root cause we can fix - the sensor algorithm needs updating for shiny floors.\n\n**Fishbone diagrams** (also called Ishikawa diagrams) help visualize multiple potential causes. You draw a \"fish skeleton\" with the problem as the head, and different categories of causes (like People, Methods, Materials, Environment) as the bones. This helps you think about all possible factors contributing to the problem.\n\nUsing these techniques helps make sure you're solving the real problem, not just treating symptoms.",
  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
