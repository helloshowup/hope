They don't just make things up as they go! Most of them use something called the FITT Principle. FITT is like a recipe for exercise that helps you get the results you want. Just like you need the right ingredients to bake cookies, you need the right mix of exercise components to reach your fitness goals.\n\nThe letters in FITT stand for Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type. Think of these as the building blocks of any good workout plan. When you understand these four parts, you can create your own exercise routine that's perfect for YOU - not just copying what someone else does. In this lesson, we'll explore each part of FITT and show you how to build your very own fitness plan!\n\n## Exploring Each Part of FITT\n\n### Frequency\n\nLet's talk about frequency first - it's probably the easiest part of FITT to understand! Frequency is just a fancy word for \"how often\" you do something. Think about your favorite TV show - maybe you watch it once a week when a new episode comes out. That's the frequency of your TV watching! With exercise, frequency means how many days each week you get your body moving. Finding the right frequency is like solving a puzzle - too little exercise and you won't see results, but too much without rest can make you tired or even injured.\n\nFrequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:\n\n- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week\n- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover\n- You don't have to do the same thing every day\n- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting\n\n**Activity**: Look at your weekly schedule and mark specific days and times when you can exercise. For example:\n- Monday: 4:00-4:30 PM\n- Wednesday: 3:30-4:00 PM\n- Saturday: 10:00-10:30 AM\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n### Intensity\n\nHave you ever noticed how some activities make your heart pound and leave you breathing hard, while others barely make you break a sweat? That difference is what we call intensity! Intensity is like the volume knob on your exercise - you can turn it up when you want a bigger challenge or turn it down when you need something easier. The cool thing about intensity is that YOU control it based on how you're feeling that day. Some days you might have tons of energy for high-intensity exercise, while other days you might need something gentler. Learning to measure your own intensity is an important skill that even professional athletes use!\n\nIntensity means how hard your body is working. Here are two ways to measure it on your own:\n\n- **Talk Test**: \n  1. During activity, try to say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing a verse of your favorite song\n  2. If you can talk comfortably = low intensity\n  3. If you can talk but not sing = medium intensity\n  4. If you can barely talk = high intensity\n\n- **Scale of Effort**: \n  1. During activity, rate your effort from 1-10\n  2. 1-3 = easy (like walking slowly)\n  3. 4-6 = medium (breathing harder but can continue)\n  4. 7-10 = hard (breathing very hard, can't continue long)\n\n**Activity**: Try these three exercises for 30 seconds each:\n1. Walking in place\n2. Jogging in place\n3. Jumping jacks\n\n<br/>\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities. start with After each one, immediately write down:Your effort score (1-10) Whether you could talk easily, with difficulty, or barely at all] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n\n### Time\n\nTime is all about how long your exercise sessions last. Think of time like a movie - some are short (like a 30-minute TV show), and others are longer (like a 2-hour superhero movie). Both can be great, but they feel different! The same goes for exercise. A quick 10-minute workout might be perfect when you're busy with homework, while a longer 45-minute session might be fun on the weekend. The good news is that even short bursts of activity count toward your daily total. So if you can't find a big chunk of time, don't worry - you can break it up into smaller, bite-sized pieces throughout your day!\n\nTime refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:\n\n- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day\n- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too (like 10 minutes in the morning, 10 at lunch, and 10 after school)\n\n**Activity**: Use a timer (phone, clock, or kitchen timer) for these practice sessions:\n1. Do any movement (march in place, dance, etc.) for 1 minute\n2. Rest for 30 seconds\n3. Repeat 3 times\n\n<br/>\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.tryu and include How did it feel? Was it too short, too long, or just right? Write this down in your fitness journal] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n### Type\n\nType is all about WHAT kind of exercise you choose to do. It's like picking what to watch on TV - sometimes you want an action movie, sometimes a comedy, and other times a documentary. Your body benefits from different types of movement just like your brain enjoys different types of shows! The three main exercise types - cardio, strength, and flexibility - each help your body in different ways. Mixing them up keeps exercise fun and gives you more complete fitness. The best part is that you get to pick activities you actually enjoy - because the best exercise plan is one that you'll actually want to do!\n\nType is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types:\n\n<br/>\n1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping\n\n- Examples you can do at home: Jogging in place, jumping jacks, dancing to music, climbing stairs\n\n2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle\n\n- Examples with no equipment: Push-ups against a wall, squats, lunges, plank position\n\n3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles\n\n- Examples: Reaching for your toes, arm circles, gentle twists\n\n**Activity**: Try one exercise from each category:\n1. Cardio: March in place for 30 seconds\n2. Strength: Do 5 wall push-ups (standing arms-length from wall, push against it)\n3. Flexibility: Reach arms overhead and gently lean side to side\n\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.start with After each one, write down:, ow it felt in your body, Which one you enjoyed most, hich one was most challenging] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content. Insert this section after all main content and any activities/assessments, typically at the document end.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures.
