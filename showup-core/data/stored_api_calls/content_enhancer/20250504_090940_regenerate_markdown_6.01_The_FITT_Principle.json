You can adjust each part to match what your body needs and what you want to achieve.\n\n## Setting Up Your Learning Space\n\nBefore we begin, let's set up your exercise learning space:\n\n1. **Find a clear area**: You'll need a space about the size of a bathroom rug where you can move freely without bumping into furniture\n2. **Equipment alternatives**:\n   - No weights? Use filled water bottles or canned food\n   - No exercise mat? Use a folded blanket or towel\n   - No jump rope? Pretend to hold one and jump in place\n3. **Safety check**:\n   - Make sure your floor isn't slippery\n   - Remove any objects you might trip over\n   - Have water nearby\n   - Wear comfortable clothes and supportive shoes\n\n## Exploring Each Part of FITT\n\n### Frequency\nFrequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:\n- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week\n- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover\n- You don't have to do the same thing every day\n- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting\n\n**Activity**: Look at your weekly schedule and mark specific days and times when you can exercise. For example:\n- Monday: 4:00-4:30 PM\n- Wednesday: 3:30-4:00 PM\n- Saturday: 10:00-10:30 AM\n\n### Intensity\nIntensity means how hard your body is working. Here are two ways to measure it on your own:\n\n- **Talk Test**: \n  1. During activity, try to say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing a verse of your favorite song\n  2. If you can talk comfortably = low intensity\n  3. If you can talk but not sing = medium intensity\n  4. If you can barely talk = high intensity\n\n- **Scale of Effort**: \n  1. During activity, rate your effort from 1-10\n  2. 1-3 = easy (like walking slowly)\n  3. 4-6 = medium (breathing harder but can continue)\n  4. 7-10 = hard (breathing very hard, can't continue long)\n\n**Activity**: Try these three exercises for 30 seconds each:\n1. Walking in place\n2. Jogging in place\n3. Jumping jacks\n\nAfter each one, immediately write down:\n- Your effort score (1-10)\n- Whether you could talk easily, with difficulty, or barely at all\n\n### Time\nTime refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:\n- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day\n- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too\n\n**Activity**: Use a timer (phone, clock, or kitchen timer) for these practice sessions:\n1. Do any movement (march in place, dance, etc.) for 1 minute\n2. Rest for 30 seconds\n3. Repeat 3 times\n\nHow did it feel? Was it too short, too long, or just right? Write this down in your fitness journal.\n\n### Type\nType is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types:\n\n1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping\n   - Examples you can do at home: Jogging in place, jumping jacks, dancing to music, climbing stairs\n\n2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle\n   - Examples with no equipment: Push-ups against a wall, squats, lunges, plank position\n\n3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles\n   - Examples: Reaching for your toes, arm circles, gentle twists\n\n**Activity**: Try one exercise from each category:\n1. Cardio: March in place for 30 seconds\n2. Strength: Do 5 wall push-ups (standing arms-length from wall, push against it)\n3. Flexibility: Reach arms overhead and gently lean side to side\n\nAfter each one, write down:\n- How it felt in your body\n- Which one you enjoyed most\n- Which one was most challenging\n\n## Creating Your Own FITT Plan\n\nNow let's create your own FITT plan with these specific steps:\n\n1. **Set a measurable goal**: Complete this sentence: \"In 4 weeks, I want to be able to ___________.\"\n   Examples:\n   - Run in place for 5 minutes without stopping\n   - Do 10 push-ups in a row\n   - Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight\n\n2. **Fill in your FITT plan worksheet**:\n\n   | Component | My Plan | Why I Chose This |\n   |-----------|---------|------------------|\n   | Frequency | ___ days per week | |\n   | Intensity | ___ out of 10 | |\n   | Time | ___ minutes per session | |\n   | Type | List specific activities: | |\n\n3. **Create a weekly schedule**: Write down exactly when you'll exercise each day:\n\n   | Day | Time | Activity | Location in Home |\n   |-----|------|----------|------------------|\n   | Monday | | | |\n   | Tuesday | | | |\n   | Wednesday | | | |\n   | Thursday | | | |\n   | Friday | | | |\n   | Saturday | | | |\n   | Sunday | | | |\n\n4. **Progress tracking**: After each workout, record:\n   - Date and time\n   - What you did\n   - How long you did it\n   - How it felt (1-10 scale)\n   - One thing you're proud of\n   - One thing to improve next time\n\n## Sample FITT Plans for Students\n\nHere are some example FITT plans with specific activities you can do at home:\n\n**For Beginners:**\n- **Frequency**: 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)\n- **Intensity**: Medium (4-5 out of 10)\n- **Time**: 20 minutes per session\n- **Type**: \n  - 5 minutes: Walking in place or around your home\n  - 5 minutes: Arm circles, wall push-ups, chair squats (sitting down and standing up)\n  - 5 minutes: Gentle stretching\n  - 5 minutes: Free dance to your favorite song\n\n**For Sports Performance:**\n- **Frequency**: 4 days per week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday)\n- **Intensity**: Mix of medium (5-6) and high (7-8)\n- **Time**: 30 minutes per session\n- **Type**: \n  - 5 minutes: Warm-up (jogging in place, arm swings)\n  - 15 minutes: Sport-specific movements (practice dribbling a ball, shooting technique, footwork patterns)\n  - 5 minutes: Strength (push-ups, squats, lunges)\n  - 5 minutes: Cool-down stretches\n\n**For Overall Fitness:**\n- **Frequency**: 5 days per week (Monday through Friday)\n- **Intensity**: Varied (see schedule)\n- **Time**: 30 minutes per session\n- **Type**: \n  - Monday: Cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) - Intensity 7/10\n  - Tuesday: Strength (bodyweight exercises) - Intensity 6/10\n  - Wednesday: Light activity (walking, gentle stretching) - Intensity 3/10\n  - Thursday: Interval training (30 seconds hard, 30 seconds easy) - Intensity 8/10\n  - Friday: Flexibility (stretching routine) - Intensity 4/10\n\n## Troubleshooting Your FITT Plan\n\nHere are solutions for common challenges you might face:\n\n**If you don't have enough space:**\n- Focus on stationary exercises (planks, push-ups, squats)\n- Use a chair for step-ups instead of running\n- Try \"traveling\" exercises in a small path (2-3 steps forward and back)\n\n**If you don't have equipment:**\n- Books in a backpack = weights\n- A towel = resistance band (pull it tight between hands)\n- Stairs = cardio machine\n- Chair = workout bench\n\n**If you're not sure you're doing exercises correctly:**\n1. Take a photo or video of yourself\n2. Compare to example images provided\n3. Check these key points:\n   - Back straight, not rounded\n   - Knees aligned with toes, not caving inward\n   - Movements controlled, not rushed\n\n## Adjusting Your FITT Plan\n\nAfter following your plan for one week, use this self-assessment checklist:\n\n- [ ] I completed all my planned workout sessions\n- [ ] The intensity level felt appropriate (challenging but doable)\n- [ ] I had enough energy to complete each session\n- [ ] I enjoyed at least some of the activities\n- [ ] I'm seeing or feeling small improvements\n\nBased on your answers, here's how to adjust:\n\n**If it feels too easy** (you checked all boxes and felt you could do more):\n1. Keep frequency the same\n2. Increase just ONE of these:\n   - Intensity: Add 1-2 points to your target effort level\n   - Time: Add 5 minutes to your sessions\n   - Type: Try the more challenging version of an exercise (regular push-ups instead of wall push-ups)\n\n**If it feels too hard** (you couldn't check most boxes):\n1. Keep frequency the same\n2. Decrease just ONE of these:\n   - Intensity: Lower your target effort by 2-3 points\n   - Time: Reduce sessions by 5-10 minutes\n   - Type: Try the easier version of exercises (wall push-ups instead of regular)\n\n**If you get bored:**\n1. Keep your schedule and timing the same\n2. Swap activities for similar ones:\n   - Instead of jogging in place, try dancing\n   - Instead of regular push-ups, try them with hands in different positions\n   - Add music to your workout\n\n**Success indicators** - You'll know your plan is working when:\n- You can complete all sessions without excessive fatigue\n- Your breathing recovers faster after exercise\n- Movements that were once hard become easier\n- You look forward to (at least some) exercise sessions\n- You can do more repetitions or time than when you started\n\nRemember, the FITT Principle gives you the power to create your own personalized fitness plan. By understanding and adjusting the Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of your workouts, you can design an exercise routine that fits your schedule, matches your interests, and helps you reach your goals. Fitness isn't about being perfect - it's about discovering what your amazing body can do!",
  "instructions": "As a skilled curriculum editor with experience in educational flow and learner comprehension:\n\nReview my draft from two perspectives: \n1) As a learner and if you have an unanswered question briefly try and edit the draft so that you answer it. limit it to minor things that will enhance the flow and remove barriers to learning.  \n2) As an editor looking to reduce signposting repetition (\"Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies\") - vary these transitions while maintaining flow\n\nFor all edits: Ensure content remains conversational and connects ideas meaningfully. Make minimal wording changes while preserving instructional intent.\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on the FITT Principle, which is a framework for designing effective exercise plans. It covers the four key components of the FITT Principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) and provides activities and examples to help the learner apply the concepts. The content is structured to introduce the FITT Principle, explore each component in detail, guide the learner through creating their own FITT plan, and offer troubleshooting tips for adjusting the plan as needed.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests two main improvements:\n\n1. Review the content from the perspective of a learner and identify any unanswered questions or areas that could be enhanced to improve flow and comprehension.\n2. Reduce repetitive signposting language (e.g. \"Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies\") and vary the transitions while maintaining instructional intent.\n\nThe enhancements should preserve the conversational tone and meaningful connections between ideas, making only minimal wording changes.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience for this content is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an asynchronous online physical education course at Excel Middle School. Key learner characteristics to address include:\n\n- Reading level at 5th-6th grade on the Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Varying prior exposure to formal physical education concepts\n- Preference for visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities\n- Limited access to specialized fitness equipment and varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday language, active voice, and direct instructions starting with action verbs. It should be structured in short paragraphs with frequent headings, subheadings, and visual elements to support comprehension and engagement.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no opportunities for peer interaction. As such, the material must be self-contained and optimized for independent learning. Formatting should prioritize clear organization, visual aids, and embedded activities to maintain learner focus and comprehension without instructor guidance.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the educational integrity of the FITT Principle framework and the step-by-step guidance for creating a personalized exercise plan.\n- Address any gaps or areas of confusion that may arise for the target middle school learners.\n- Reduce repetitive signposting language while maintaining logical flow and instructional intent.\n- Ensure content remains conversational and connects ideas meaningfully for the target audience.\n- Adapt examples, language, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school learner profile.\n- Incorporate visual elements, hands-on activities, and engagement strategies to support the asynchronous online delivery.\n\n## Suggested Approach\nBased on the enhancement prompt and target learner profile, the key focus for content enhancement should be:\n\n1. Review the content through the lens of a middle school learner and identify any areas that could be clarified or expanded to improve comprehension and flow.\n2. Reduce repetitive signposting language by varying transitions between ideas while preserving the original instructional intent.\n3. Refine the language, examples, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school learner characteristics.\n4. Incorporate more visual elements, hands-on activities, and engagement strategies to support independent learning in the asynchronous online format.\n5. Ensure the content remains conversational, connects ideas meaningfully, and preserves the educational integrity of the FITT Principle framework.\n\nThe enhancements should be targeted and minimal, focusing on improving flow, comprehension, and engagement for the target learners without significantly altering the original structure or intent of the material.",
