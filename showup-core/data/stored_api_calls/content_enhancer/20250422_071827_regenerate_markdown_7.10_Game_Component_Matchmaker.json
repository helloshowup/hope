Example: Designing a robot that can sort recycling materials by type requires matching appropriate sensors (color/material sensors), decision algorithms (material classification), and sorting mechanisms (servo-controlled gates).\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "Review the attached robotics course material for middle school students in an asynchronous learning environment, applying the following targeted improvements:\n\n1. Address knowledge gaps without re-explaining fundamental concepts (like \"input\" or \"sensor\") that contextually appear to be previously introduced\n2. Enhance content flow to ensure logical progression between concepts\n3. Add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity\n4. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replace overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms appropriate for middle school comprehension levels when a term would likely create a barrier to learning\n\nEdit constraints:\n- Maximum 10% text modification\n- Preserve all formatting, headings, and document structure\n- Maintain exactly one empty line between paragraphs\n- Vocabulary simplification should be used sparingly and only for terms that would genuinely impede comprehension\n- Return content unchanged if no meaningful improvements are identified",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a brief description of a potential game component called \"Component Matchmaker\" that could be used in a robotics course. It outlines a design challenge where students must select appropriate inputs, processing methods, and outputs to solve specific robotics problems.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Address any knowledge gaps without re-explaining fundamental concepts that have likely been previously introduced.\n2. Enhance the content flow to ensure a logical progression between concepts.\n3. Add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity.\n4. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replace overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms appropriate for middle school comprehension levels, but only when a term would likely create a barrier to learning.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Maintain content at a 5th-6th grade reading level using everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds.\n- Write in an active, conversational tone to engage middle school students.\n- Incorporate visual elements like diagrams and labeled illustrations to support understanding.\n- Connect concepts to real-world examples relevant to the target age group.\n- Provide opportunities for students to actively process information through \"Stop and Think\" moments.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online learning environment, so it should be structured in clear, self-contained \"chunks\" with ample visual breaks and formatting to support independent learning.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose and structure of the \"Component Matchmaker\" game concept.\n- Ensure the content flow logically progresses from one concept to the next.\n- Simplify vocabulary only when absolutely necessary to avoid comprehension barriers.\n- Enhance the content with visual aids and real-world connections to improve engagement and understanding for the target learners.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify any potential knowledge gaps or areas where the flow could be improved.\n2. Enhance the content by:\n   - Adding minimal signposting phrases to clarify transitions between concepts, if needed.\n   - [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replacing overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms, but only when necessary to avoid comprehension barriers.\n   - Incorporating visual elements like diagrams, labeled illustrations, and real-world examples to support middle school learners.\n   - Maintaining the overall structure and purpose of the \"Component Matchmaker\" game concept.\n3. Ensure the enhanced content aligns with the target learner profile and learning medium considerations outlined above.\n4. Review the final content to verify it meets the enhancement requirements while preserving the core educational value.",
