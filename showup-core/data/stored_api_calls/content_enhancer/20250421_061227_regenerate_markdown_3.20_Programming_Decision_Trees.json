A decision tree is like a flowchart that helps the robot decide what to do next based on sensor information.\n\nHere's a simple example of a decision tree for a robot navigating a room:\n\n```\nCheck front distance sensor\nIf distance < 20 cm:\n    Check left distance sensor\n    If left distance > 30 cm:\n        Turn left\n    Else:\n        Check right distance sensor\n        If right distance > 30 cm:\n            Turn right\n        Else:\n            Turn around\nElse:\n    Move forward\n```\n\nThis decision tree helps the robot avoid obstacles by checking sensors and making movement decisions based on what it detects. The robot first checks if there's an obstacle directly ahead. If there is, it looks for clear space to the left or right. If there's no clear path in any direction, it turns around.\n\nMore complex decision trees can handle many different sensor inputs and situations. For example, a search and rescue robot might use temperature sensors, cameras, microphones, and distance sensors together to find people in a disaster area, with a decision tree that prioritizes investigating areas with signs of human presence.\n\nBy combining sensors with well-designed decision trees, robots can navigate complex environments and respond appropriately to changing conditions - much like animals do in nature.\n\n### **Sensors in Action: Real-World Examples**\n\nLet's look at how different sensors help robots move in the real world:\n\n**Robot Vacuum Cleaners**: These popular home robots use several sensors working together. Bump sensors tell the robot when it hits something, cliff sensors prevent it from falling down stairs, and some models use cameras to map your home. All these sensors feed information to the robot's program, which decides how to move next - just like you might navigate around furniture in a dark room by feeling your way.\n\n**Line-Following Robots**: Many beginner robots use simple light sensors to follow a dark line on a light background. When the sensor detects the robot moving off the line, it signals the wheels to adjust - turning left if the robot drifts right, or turning right if it drifts left. This creates a zigzag pattern that keeps the robot following the line, similar to how you might follow a trail in the woods.\n\n**Drone Obstacle Avoidance**: Modern drones use distance sensors (like sonar or infrared) to detect obstacles in their path. When flying toward a tree, the sensors detect the obstacle and automatically adjust the drone's flight path to avoid collision. Some advanced drones can navigate through forests without hitting branches - similar to how birds fly through dense trees.\n\nThese examples show how sensors act like robot \"senses\" - providing the information needed to make smart movement decisions, just like your eyes, ears, and sense of touch help you move through the world.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot that needs to navigate around obstacles. What decision process would it need to follow? How would you program this? Think about the sensors the robot would need and the logical steps in its decision-making process.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nA robotics team is designing a robot to climb vertical surfaces.

  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of how robots use decision trees and sensors to navigate and respond to their environment. It explains the concept of decision trees, gives examples of how different sensors are used in real-world robots, and includes a checkpoint and key takeaways to reinforce the learning objectives.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt focuses on applying specific markdown formatting changes to the content, including:\n1. Adding bold formatting to key terms, headers, and important concept labels\n2. Ensuring proper paragraph breaks with empty lines between paragraphs\n3. Preserving the original content and structure without any other modifications\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) with varying exposure to STEM concepts and first-time formal robotics learning.\n- The content should be adapted to a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday language, active voice, and short sentences.\n- Visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations should be incorporated to support understanding.\n- Engagement strategies such as real-world examples, conversational tone, and \"Stop and Think\" moments should be used.\n- Key terms should be bolded when first introduced, and consistent formatting should be applied throughout.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the formatting and structure must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without instructor guidance.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content, which is to explain how robots use decision trees and sensors to navigate and respond to their environment.\n- Preserve the original structure, organization, and flow of the content while enhancing readability and engagement through formatting changes.\n- Ensure the content remains accessible and comprehensible for the target 11-14 year old audience with limited prior robotics knowledge.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Identify all key terms, headers, and important concept labels that should be bolded for emphasis.\n2. Ensure proper paragraph breaks with exactly one empty line between paragraphs.\n3. Review the content for any areas that could benefit from additional visual elements (images, diagrams, etc.) to support understanding.\n4. Evaluate the language and sentence structure to confirm it aligns with the 5th-6th grade reading level and active, conversational tone.\n5. Consider incorporating more \"Stop and Think\" moments or real-world examples to enhance engagement and information retention.\n6. Apply consistent formatting for similar types of information (e.g., bulleted lists, call-out boxes) to improve readability.\n7. Validate that no other changes are made beyond the specified markdown formatting transformations to preserve the original content.\n\nThe enhanced content should maintain the educational value and core purpose of the original material while improving readability, engagement, and accessibility for the target 11-14 year old learners in the asynchronous online environment.",
