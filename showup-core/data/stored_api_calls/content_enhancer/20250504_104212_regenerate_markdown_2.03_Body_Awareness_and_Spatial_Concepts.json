These skills help you move safely and effectively, giving you the building blocks needed for sports, games, and everyday movement. \n\nThis lesson continues what we learned about non-locomotor movements and prepares you for upcoming balance and coordination activities.\n\n## Home Setup Instructions\nBefore starting this lesson, you'll need:\n\n- An open area approximately 6x6 feet (minimum)\n- 3 pieces of paper and a marker for making signs\n- A timer or stopwatch (phone timer works great)\n- Optional: Music player\n- Comfortable clothes that allow movement\n\nIf space is limited:\n\n- Focus on stationary movements and smaller steps\n- Use a hallway for directional movements\n- Clear a small area of furniture temporarily\n\n## Personal vs. General Space\nHere's the difference:\n\n**Personal space**: The area around your body that moves with you - about arm's length in all directions\n\n**General space**: The shared area you move through - like the open space in your home\n\nActivity: \"Space Explorer\"\n1. Stand in the middle of your open area\n2. Create your \"personal space bubble\" by extending your arms fully in all directions\n3. Make these specific shapes within your bubble:\n\n   - Tall shape: Reach up high with both arms\n   - Small shape: Crouch down with arms wrapped around knees\n   - Wide shape: Arms and legs stretched out like a star\n   - Twisted shape: Feet forward, upper body turned to one side\n4. Move through your general space using these movements:\n\n   - 10 careful walking steps\n   - 5 tip-toe steps\n   - 8 side steps\n5. After completing these movements, take a moment to think about:\n\n   - One time when you need personal space awareness at home\n   - One time when you need general space awareness outside\n\n**Troubleshooting**: If you bump into objects, make your movements smaller or rearrange your space. Success looks like completing all movements without collisions.\n\n## Directional Movements (10-15 minutes)\nThe main directions are:\n\n**Forward/backward**: Moving toward/away from where you're facing\n\n**Sideways**: Moving to your right or left side\n\n**Up/down**: Moving toward the ceiling or floor\n\nActivity: \"Direction Detective\"\n1. Mark a starting point on the floor with a sock or piece of paper\n2. Complete this exact movement sequence:\n\n   - 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward\n   - 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left\n   - Reach up high 3 times, crouch down low 3 times\n3. Create your own sequence with 6-8 movements and write it down\n4. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row\n5. Self-check: Did you maintain control throughout all movements? Could you repeat your sequence exactly the same way multiple times?\n\n**Example sequence**: 2 steps forward, 1 step left, reach up twice, 3 steps backward, crouch down, 2 steps right\n\n## Levels of Movement (10-15 minutes)\nThe three main levels are:\n\n**High level**: Movements that reach toward the ceiling (jumping, reaching up)\n![High level movement - person reaching upward](placeholder for high level image)\n\n**Medium level**: Movements at waist or chest height (walking, arm circles)\n![Medium level movement - person with arms at chest height](placeholder for medium level image)\n\n**Low level**: Movements close to the floor (crawling, crouching)\n![Low level movement - person in crouched position](placeholder for low level image)\n\nActivity: \"Level Shifters\"\n1. Make three signs labeled \"high,\" \"medium,\" and \"low\" and place them where you can see them\n2. Set your timer for 20 seconds\n3. Move freely during the countdown\n4. When the timer beeps, look at one of your level cards (your choice)\n5. Create and hold a movement or shape at that level for 5 seconds\n6. Repeat this process 6 times, trying to use each level at least twice\n7. After completing all rounds, take a moment to think about:\n\n   - One sport that uses high level movements (example: volleyball - jumping to spike)\n   - One sport that uses medium level movements (example: basketball - dribbling)\n   - One sport that uses low level movements (example: bowling - lunging low)\n\n**Adaptation for limited space**: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements.\n\n## Body Shapes (10-15 minutes)\nFour basic body shapes are:\n\n**Wide**: Stretching out to take up more space (star jump)\n![Wide shape - person with arms and legs extended](placeholder for wide shape image)\n\n**Narrow**: Making yourself thin or skinny (pencil position)\n![Narrow shape - person standing straight with arms at sides](placeholder for narrow shape image)\n\n**Curved**: Creating rounded shapes with your body (ball shape)\n![Curved shape - person in rounded position](placeholder for curved shape image)\n\n**Twisted**: Rotating parts of your body in different directions (twist at waist)\n![Twisted shape - person with lower body facing forward, upper body turned](placeholder for twisted shape image)\n\nActivity: \"Shape Shifter\"\n1. Practice each shape individually, holding for 5 seconds:\n\n   - Wide: Stand with legs apart and arms stretched out to sides\n   - Narrow: Stand tall with feet together, arms straight at sides\n   - Curved: Make a C-shape with your body, either standing or on the floor\n   - Twisted: Keep hips facing forward, turn upper body to right or left\n2. Set your timer for 15 seconds\n3. Move freely until the timer beeps, then freeze in one of the shapes\n4. Repeat 8 times, trying each shape at least twice\n5. Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together\n6. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row\n7. Draw your three-shape sequence on paper or describe it in writing\n\n**Success criteria**: You should be able to clearly demonstrate each shape with proper form and hold it steady for at least 5 seconds.\n\n## Putting It All Together: Spatial Awareness Challenge (10-15 minutes)\nNow let's combine everything you've learned:\n\n1. Create a movement card set by writing these 8 challenges on separate pieces of paper:\n\n   - \"Make a wide shape at a high level\"\n   - \"Move backward at a low level\"\n   - \"Create a twisted shape in your personal space\"\n   - \"Travel sideways through general space at a medium level\"\n   - \"Make a narrow shape while moving forward\"\n   - \"Create a curved shape at a low level\"\n   - \"Move in a high level with a twisted shape\"\n   - \"Travel in a zigzag pattern at medium level\"\n\n2. Shuffle the cards and place them face down\n3. Draw one card at a time and perform the movement\n4. After each movement, rate yourself:\n\n   - Green: I did this movement correctly and confidently\n   - Yellow: I did this movement but need more practice\n   - Red: I found this movement difficult\n\n5. Choose one \"yellow\" movement to practice 3 more times until it improves\n\n**Adaptation**: If any movements are too difficult, modify them to match your ability level. For example, if balance is challenging, you can hold onto a chair for support.\n\n## Self-Assessment and Reflection\nTake a few minutes to think about what you've learned. Complete these statements in your mind or write them down:\n\n1. I can identify personal space by _______________.\n2. I can identify general space by _______________.\n3. The three levels of movement are _______________.\n4. The four basic body shapes are _______________.\n5. One movement I performed well was _______________.\n6. One movement I want to improve is _______________.\n7. I could use spatial awareness in my daily life when _______________.\n8. These skills connect to (sport/activity) by _______________.\n\n## Progress Milestones\nYou've successfully completed this lesson when you can:\n\n- Clearly demonstrate all four body shapes\n- Move confidently at all three levels\n- Follow a sequence of directional movements without errors\n- Distinguish between personal and general space in practice\n- Create and perform your own movement sequence combining at least three concepts\n\n## Extensions and Adaptations\n\n- For extra challenge: Create a 30-second routine that includes at least one example of each concept (space, direction, level, and shape)\n- For support: Practice one concept at a time until comfortable before combining them\n- Connection to other subjects: These directions relate to math (coordinate planes) or dance (choreography)\n- Technology option: Record a video of your movements for self-assessment, watching it to identify areas for improvement\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Challenges\n\n- **Limited space**: Focus on stationary movements and smaller steps\n- **Balance difficulties**: Keep one hand near a wall or sturdy furniture for support\n- **Tracking progress**: Use a simple chart to mark off completed activities\n- **Remembering movements**: Write down or draw your sequences before performing them\n- **Physical limitations**: Adapt movements to your ability level - seated versions work for most activities\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your body moves through both personal space (the bubble around you) and general space (the area you travel through), which helps you move safely without collisions in physical activities.\n- Movement can happen at three different levels (high, medium, low) and in four basic body shapes (wide, narrow, curved, twisted) that form the building blocks for sports and dance.\n- Directional awareness (forward/backward, sideways, up/down) allows you to follow and create movement sequences that improve coordination and spatial intelligence.\n---keytakeawaysEND---",
  "instructions": "As a skilled curriculum editor with experience in educational flow and learner comprehension:\n\nReview my draft from two perspectives: \n1) As a learner and if you have an unanswered question briefly try and edit the draft so that you answer it. limit it to minor things that will enhance the flow and remove barriers to learning.  \n2) As an editor looking to reduce signposting repetition (\"Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies\") - vary these transitions while maintaining flow\n\nFor all edits: Ensure content remains conversational and connects ideas meaningfully. Make minimal wording changes while preserving instructional intent.\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a lesson on body awareness and spatial concepts for a physical education course. It covers key topics such as personal vs. general space, directional movements, levels of movement, and basic body shapes. The lesson includes several hands-on activities to help students explore and apply these fundamental movement skills.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Review the draft from the perspective of a learner, making minor edits to improve flow and remove barriers to learning.\n2. Reduce repetitive signposting (\"Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies\") by varying the transitions while maintaining instructional intent.\n\nThe edits should keep the content conversational and ensure ideas are connected meaningfully, with minimal wording changes to preserve the original instructional purpose.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an asynchronous online physical education course. Key considerations for this learner profile include:\n\n- Reading level at 5th-6th grade, using everyday language and short sentences\n- Visual learning preferences, with plenty of images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations\n- Limited access to specialized equipment, requiring adaptations using common household items\n- Need for clear safety guidelines, warm-up/cool-down instructions, and modifications for different abilities\n- Engaging, relatable content that connects to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nAs an asynchronous online course, the content must be self-contained and easy to navigate without peer interaction or instructor guidance. Formatting should optimize for a digital, self-paced learning experience, with:\n\n- Frequent headings, subheadings, and visual breaks to create clear \"chunks\" of information\n- Highlighted call-out boxes for important tips, warnings, and instructions\n- Printable tracking sheets or activity logs with simple, clean layouts\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the clear instructional flow and learning objectives outlined in the current content\n- Preserve the conversational, friendly tone and relatable examples that engage the target learners\n- Ensure all safety guidelines, equipment alternatives, and space considerations are prominently featured\n- Optimize the content structure and formatting for an effective asynchronous online learning experience\n\n## Suggested Approach\nBased on the enhancement prompt and target learner profile, the recommended approach is to:\n\n1. Review the content from the perspective of a middle school student, identifying any areas that could be clarified or connected more seamlessly.\n2. Vary the transitional language and signposting between concepts, avoiding repetitive phrasing while preserving the logical flow.\n3. Enhance the visual elements, including more labeled diagrams, illustrations, and examples to support the kinesthetic and visual learning preferences of the target audience.\n4. Streamline the formatting and organization to create a clean, easy-to-navigate online learning experience, with clear section breaks, callouts, and tracking tools.\n5. Ensure all safety information, equipment alternatives, and space considerations are prominently featured to address the limitations of the asynchronous, home-based learning environment.\n\nThe goal is to refine the content to be more engaging, accessible, and self-guided for the 11-14 year old physical education students, while preserving the core instructional value and intent.",

Move through your general space using these movements:\n\n   - 10 careful walking steps\n   - 5 tip-toe steps\n   - 8 side steps\n5. After completing these movements, take a moment to think about:\n\n   - One time when you need personal space awareness at home (like moving around family members in the kitchen)\n   - One time when you need general space awareness outside (like navigating through a crowded hallway)\n\n**Troubleshooting**: If you bump into objects, make your movements smaller or rearrange your space. Success looks like completing all movements without collisions.\n\n## Directional Movements (10-15 minutes)\nNow let's explore how we can move in different directions:\n\n**Forward/backward**: Moving toward/away from where you're facing\n\n**Sideways**: Moving to your right or left side\n\n**Up/down**: Moving toward the ceiling or floor\n\nActivity: \"Direction Detective\"\n1. Mark a starting point on the floor with a sock or piece of paper\n2. Complete this exact movement sequence:\n\n   - 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward\n   - 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left\n   - Reach up high 3 times, crouch down low 3 times\n3. Create your own sequence with 6-8 movements and write it down\n4. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row\n5. Self-check: Did you maintain control throughout all movements? Could you repeat your sequence exactly the same way multiple times?\n\n**Example sequence**: 2 steps forward, 1 step left, reach up twice, 3 steps backward, crouch down, 2 steps right\n\n## Levels of Movement (10-15 minutes)\nAs we continue our exploration, let's look at the three main levels of movement:\n\n**High level**: Movements that reach toward the ceiling (jumping, reaching up)\n![High level movement - person reaching upward](placeholder for high level image)\n\n**Medium level**: Movements at waist or chest height (walking, arm circles)\n![Medium level movement - person with arms at chest height](placeholder for medium level image)\n\n**Low level**: Movements close to the floor (crawling, crouching)\n![Low level movement - person in crouched position](placeholder for low level image)\n\nActivity: \"Level Shifters\"\n1.

Repeat this process 6 times, trying to use each level at least twice\n7. After completing all rounds, take a moment to think about:\n\n   - One sport that uses high level movements (example: volleyball - jumping to spike)\n   - One sport that uses medium level movements (example: basketball - dribbling)\n   - One sport that uses low level movements (example: bowling - lunging low)\n\n**Adaptation for limited space**: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements.\n\n## Body Shapes (10-15 minutes)\nNext, let's discover the four basic body shapes that form the foundation of many movements:\n\n**Wide**: Stretching out to take up more space (star jump)\n![Wide shape - person with arms and legs extended](placeholder for wide shape image)\n\n**Narrow**: Making yourself thin or skinny (pencil position)\n![Narrow shape - person standing straight with arms at sides](placeholder for narrow shape image)\n\n**Curved**: Creating rounded shapes with your body (ball shape)\n![Curved shape - person in rounded position](placeholder for curved shape image)\n\n**Twisted**: Rotating parts of your body in different directions (twist at waist)\n![Twisted shape - person with lower body facing forward, upper body turned](placeholder for twisted shape image)\n\nActivity: \"Shape Shifter\"\n1. Practice each shape individually, holding for 5 seconds:\n\n   - Wide: Stand with legs apart and arms stretched out to sides\n   - Narrow: Stand tall with feet together, arms straight at sides\n   - Curved: Make a C-shape with your body, either standing or on the floor\n   - Twisted: Keep hips facing forward, turn upper body to right or left\n2. Set your timer for 15 seconds\n3. Move freely until the timer beeps, then freeze in one of the shapes\n4. Repeat 8 times, trying each shape at least twice\n5. Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together\n6. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row\n7. Draw your three-shape sequence on paper or describe it in writing\n\n**Success criteria**: You should be able to clearly demonstrate each shape with proper form and hold it steady for at least 5 seconds.\n\n## Putting It All Together: Spatial Awareness Challenge (10-15 minutes)\nNow that we've practiced each concept separately, let's combine everything you've learned:\n\n1. Create a movement card set by writing these 8 challenges on separate pieces of paper:\n\n   - \"Make a wide shape at a high level\"\n   - \"Move backward at a low level\"\n   - \"Create a twisted shape in your personal space\"\n   - \"Travel sideways through general space at a medium level\"\n   - \"Make a narrow shape while moving forward\"\n   - \"Create a curved shape at a low level\"\n   - \"Move in a high level with a twisted shape\"\n   - \"Travel in a zigzag pattern at medium level\"\n\n2. Shuffle the cards and place them face down\n3. Draw one card at a time and perform the movement\n4. After each movement, rate yourself:\n\n   - Green: I did this movement correctly and confidently\n   - Yellow: I did this movement but need more practice\n   - Red: I found this movement difficult\n\n5. Choose one \"yellow\" movement to practice 3 more times until it improves\n\n**Adaptation**: If any movements are too difficult, modify them to match your ability level. For example, if balance is challenging, you can hold onto a chair for support.\n\n## Self-Assessment and Reflection\nTake a few minutes to think about what you've learned.
