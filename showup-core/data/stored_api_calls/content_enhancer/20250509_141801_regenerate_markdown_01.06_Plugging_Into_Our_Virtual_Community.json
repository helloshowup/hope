  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the virtual community spaces available to students at Excel High School, an asynchronous online learning environment. It covers key features like discussion boards, announcement feeds, chat channels, virtual clubs, and school-wide events. The content also outlines best practices for engaging with the community, such as posting introductions, finding study partners, and following digital citizenship guidelines.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests the addition of several linking paragraphs to improve the flow and cohesion of the content. Specifically, the prompt asks to:\n1. Add a linking paragraph between the \"Connecting with a Study Buddy\" and \"Best Practices for Posting an Introduction\" sections.\n2. Add a linking paragraph between the \"Building Meaningful Connections\" and \"Digital Citizenship and Community Guidelines\" sections.\n3. Add a linking paragraph between the \"How to Get Help When Needed\" and \"Putting It Into Practice\" sections.\n\nThe goal is to create a more natural, AI-like writing style that seamlessly integrates the new content with the existing material.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are middle and high school students (grades 6-12) enrolled in Excel High School's asynchronous online learning program. Key considerations:\n\n- Reading level: Use plain language with short sentences, aiming for a 5th-6th grade reading level for younger students and progressively increasing complexity for high schoolers.\n- Engagement: Break content into manageable chunks and favor visual, interactive elements like examples, diagrams, and storytelling to maintain interest.\n- Cultural sensitivity: Ensure examples and references are inclusive and widely understandable for a globally distributed student population.\n- Flexibility: Design activities that can be completed with minimal materials and adapted for small or shared learning spaces.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nAs an asynchronous online program, the content must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without daily external supervision. Considerations include:\n- Providing clear, step-by-step instructions for all activities and community engagement.\n- Incorporating features that support self-management, such as checklists, progress tracking, and access to academic coaching.\n- Ensuring seamless access to community spaces and communication channels through the online platform.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and informative tone of the existing content.\n- Preserve the core purpose of introducing students to the virtual community and guiding their initial engagement.\n- Enhance the content's cohesion and flow without significantly altering the original structure or messaging.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to align with the target learner profile while preserving the original intent.\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online learning environment without being overly prescriptive about formatting or specific features.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the existing content to fully understand its purpose, structure, and key elements.\n2. Analyze the enhancement prompt to extract the specific requirements for adding linking paragraphs.\n3. Determine the appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the target learner profile.\n4. Craft the new linking paragraphs in a style that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding text, maintaining the informative tone and educational integrity.\n5. Ensure the added content aligns with the asynchronous online learning environment and supports self-paced, independent engagement.\n6. Review the enhanced content holistically to verify it meets the key considerations and provides a cohesive, learner-centered experience.",

Participate regularly to build connections\n5. Consider starting your own club if you don't find one that matches your interests\n\n*Connecting with a Study Buddy*\nLearning online can sometimes feel like you're tackling challenging subjects all by yourself. That's where a study buddy comes in – someone who's working through the same material and facing similar challenges. Many Excel students have found that having a regular study partner not only improves their grades but also makes the learning process more enjoyable.\n\nThink of a study buddy as your academic teammate. You might meet up virtually to quiz each other before tests, work through difficult problems together, or simply check in about assignment deadlines. These partnerships often develop into friendships that extend beyond academics, creating connections that make your online school experience feel more personal and supported.\n\n- Look for classmates who share similar academic goals\n- Reach out through discussion boards or during group activities\n- Set up regular check-ins to discuss coursework and assignments\n- Share study strategies and resources\n- Provide encouragement and accountability for each other\n\n*Best Practices for Posting an Introduction*\nWhen you first join our online community, posting an introduction is like walking into a new classroom and saying hello. It might feel a little awkward at first, but it's the first step toward building connections with your classmates. A thoughtful introduction helps others get to know you and find common interests that could spark conversations or even friendships.\n\nRemember that your introduction creates a first impression in our virtual community. You don't need to share your life story, but including a few personal details along with your academic interests helps classmates see you as a real person behind the screen. The best introductions strike a balance between being friendly and professional, giving others just enough information to start a conversation with you.\n\n<br/>\n1. Share your name, grade level, and location (as you're comfortable)\n2. Mention a few of your interests, hobbies, or activities\n3. Share your academic goals or what you hope to learn\n4. Ask a question to invite responses\n5. Use a friendly, approachable tone\n6. Keep it brief (about 5-7 sentences is ideal)\n7. Respond to others who comment on your introduction\n\n**Building Meaningful Connections**\nMaking friends online might seem challenging at first, but many Excel students have formed lasting friendships through our virtual platforms. The key is to approach online interactions with the same sincerity and interest you would bring to in-person conversations. When you consistently engage with the same classmates across different spaces – responding to their discussion posts, joining the same clubs, or partnering on projects – relationships naturally develop over time.\n\nDon't be discouraged if meaningful connections don't form overnight. Just like traditional friendships, online relationships take time to develop. Start by finding common ground with classmates who share your interests or academic goals. Small interactions add up – commenting on someone's discussion post today might lead to collaborating on a project next month and becoming study partners by the end of the semester. The students who get the most from our community are those who show up regularly and engage authentically.\n\n- Be consistent in your participation\n- Show genuine interest in others by asking questions\n- Share your own experiences and perspectives\n- Offer help and support to your classmates\n- Participate in both academic and social conversations\n- Be patient—relationships develop over time\n\n**Digital Citizenship and Community Guidelines**\nIn our physical world, we understand the importance of being good neighbors and responsible community members. The same principles apply in our virtual school environment, though sometimes the rules of digital interaction aren't as obvious as they are in person. At Excel High School, we believe that positive online behavior creates a learning environment where everyone feels respected and valued.\n\nDigital citizenship goes beyond just following rules – it's about contributing to a culture where productive learning can happen. When you communicate thoughtfully, acknowledge others' contributions, and maintain appropriate boundaries, you're helping build a community that benefits everyone. Remember that unlike casual social media, our school platforms are educational spaces where your digital footprint reflects on you as a student and community member. The habits you develop here will serve you well in future academic and professional online environments.\n\n- Communicate respectfully and considerately\n- Protect your privacy and respect others' privacy\n- Give credit when sharing others' ideas or work\n- Think before you post—your digital footprint is permanent\n- Report any concerning behavior to your instructor or counselor\n- Follow Excel High School's code of conduct in all interactions\n\n**How to Get Help When Needed**\nEven the most tech-savvy students occasionally run into questions or challenges when navigating our virtual community. Whether you're having trouble accessing a discussion board, unsure about appropriate posting etiquette, or experiencing technical glitches during a virtual club meeting, remember that support is always available. You're never expected to figure everything out on your own.\n\nOur support team understands the unique challenges of online learning environments and is committed to helping you overcome any obstacles quickly. Don't hesitate to reach out at the first sign of difficulty – addressing small issues promptly prevents them from becoming bigger problems that might interfere with your community participation. Most questions can be resolved with a quick message or email, getting you back to connecting with your classmates and engaging in school activities without missing a beat.\n\n- Contact your academic advisor through the messaging system\n- Visit the Tech Support page in your student portal for technical issues\n- Check the FAQ section for common questions about community participation\n- Email community@excelhighschool.com for specific community-related questions\n\n**Putting It Into Practice**\nTo start building your virtual community connections today:\n\n<br/>\n1.
