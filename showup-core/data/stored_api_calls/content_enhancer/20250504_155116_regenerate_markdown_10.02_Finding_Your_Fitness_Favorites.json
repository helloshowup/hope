Choose a song that's 3-4 minutes long\n2. Create 4 different movements you can repeat (examples: arm circles, marching in place, side steps, jumping jacks)\n3. Practice each movement for 30 seconds\n4. Put them together with your music\n5. Complete the entire song using your dance moves\n\n**Success Check:** You've completed this activity successfully when you:\n- Created 4 distinct movements\n- Combined them into a sequence\n- Completed the entire song without stopping\n- Noticed which movements raised your heart rate the most\n\n**Modifications:**\n- Easier: Use slower songs and seated movements\n- Harder: Add more complex movements like turns or level changes\n\n### Partner Activities\nThese activities typically need one other person, but here's how to practice solo.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Wall ball (throwing against a wall)\n- Shadow badminton\n- Tennis skills practice\n- Sock basketball\n\n**Try This:** Sock Basketball Setup\n1. Place a laundry basket or box 6-8 feet away from your starting line\n2. Roll 3-5 pairs of socks into balls\n3. Create 3 different shooting positions (marked with paper or tape)\n4. From each position, take 5 shots\n5. Record how many shots you make from each position\n6. Calculate your shooting percentage (shots made ÷ total shots × 100)\n\n**Success Check:** You've mastered this activity when you:\n- Hit at least 3 out of 5 shots from your closest position\n- Successfully attempt shots from all three positions\n- Calculate your shooting percentage correctly\n- Identify which position was most challenging and why\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- If your sock balls unravel, use rubber bands or tape to secure them\n- If you lack floor space, try shooting from seated positions at different angles\n- If the target is too difficult, start with a larger container or move closer\n\n### Team Activities\nThese activities usually need several people, but here's how to practice individual skills.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Basketball dribbling and shooting\n- Football throwing accuracy\n- Volleyball bumping against a wall\n- Solo tag (interval training)\n\n**Try This:** Home Obstacle Course\n1. Set up 5 stations in your activity space:\n\n- Station 1: 10 jumping jacks\n- Station 2: Weave through 4 markers (water bottles/cups)\n- Station 3: 5 sock ball tosses into a container\n- Station 4: 10 mountain climbers (or marching in place)\n- Station 5: Balance on one foot for 10 seconds\n2. Complete each station in order\n3. Record how long it takes to complete the entire course\n4. Rest for 2 minutes\n5. Try again and see if you can improve your time\n\n**Success Check:** You've completed this activity successfully when you:\n- Finish the entire course without skipping stations\n- Complete at least 2 full attempts\n- Improve your time on the second attempt\n- Identify which station was most challenging for you\n\n**Equipment Alternatives:**\n- No markers? Use books, stuffed animals, or pieces of paper\n- No space for mountain climbers? Do arm circles or seated punches\n- Trouble balancing? Start by holding onto a chair for support\n\n### Adventure Activities\nThese activities get you exploring your home environment in new ways.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Indoor \"hiking\" (walking different paths through your home)\n- Stationary \"bike riding\" (seated pedaling motions)\n- Home scavenger hunts\n- Sensory exploration\n\n**Try This:** Home Exploration Challenge\n1. Create a scavenger hunt list with these items:\n\n- Something with an interesting texture\n- Something that makes a sound\n- Something you can balance on one hand\n- Something that reminds you of being active\n- Something with your favorite color\n2. Set a timer for 5 minutes\n3. Find all items and bring them to your starting point\n4. For each item, do 30 seconds of a movement that relates to that item\n5. Record what you found and what movements you did\n\n**Success Check:** You've completed this activity when you:\n- Find at least 4 of the 5 items\n- Create and perform a unique movement for each item\n- Complete all movements with proper form\n- Document your items and movements on your activity sheet\n\n**Adaptation Ideas:**\n- Limited mobility? Focus on upper body movements or seated activities\n- Small space? Use items within reach and focus on stationary movements\n- Shared space? Create a \"quiet\" version using smaller movements\n\n### Mindful Movement\nThese focus on breathing, stretching, and feeling calm.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Basic yoga poses\n- Gentle stretching\n- Tai Chi inspired movements\n- Deep breathing exercises\n\n**Try This:** Mindful Movement Sequence\n1. Find a comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed\n2. Complete this sequence:\n\n- Seated position: Take 5 deep breaths (count to 4 breathing in, count to 4 breathing out)\n- Gentle reach: Extend arms overhead for 3 breaths\n- Forward fold: Reach toward toes while seated or standing for 3 breaths\n- Gentle twist: Turn shoulders right then left for 3 breaths each side\n- Return to seated position: Take 5 more deep breaths\n3. After completing the sequence, write down:\n\n- One area of your body that feels different\n- One word that describes how you feel now\n\n**Success Check:** You've completed this activity successfully when you:\n- Finish the entire sequence without rushing\n- Coordinate your movements with your breath\n- Identify specific body sensations afterward\n- Notice a change in how you feel mentally or physically\n\n**Form Guide:**\n- Keep movements slow and controlled\n- Never stretch to the point of pain\n- Focus your eyes on one spot during balance poses\n- If you feel dizzy, return to normal breathing and seated position\n\n## ACTIVITY: Personal Fitness Inventory\n\nComplete this chart by checking the activities you've tried and rating your enjoyment:\n\n| Activity Type | Examples I've Tried | Enjoyment (1-5) | Could Do At Home?

  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on exploring a variety of fitness activities for middle school students.

Address the specific needs outlined in the enhancement prompt, including:\n   - Identifying and processing all properly formatted content generation instruction blocks\n   - Generating new content that precisely fulfills the requested specifications\n   - Replacing only the instruction blocks (including delimiters) with the generated content\n   - Ensuring seamless integration of the new content with the surrounding text\n3. Preserve all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, ---keytakeaways---) exactly as they appear.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: English-speaking students\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical Space/Equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday language, short sentences, active voice, and clear instructions starting with action verbs. Incorporate visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations to support understanding. Provide alternatives and adaptations for different physical abilities and home environments.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained, with all necessary information and instructions provided within the text. Formatting should be optimized for easy reading and comprehension on a digital device.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the original content's educational value and pedagogical structure.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to match the target learner's profile.\n- Ensure the generated content seamlessly integrates with the surrounding text.\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth throughout the document.\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the original content.\n- Do not modify any text outside the instruction blocks or create new instruction blocks.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Thoroughly analyze each valid instruction block to understand the requested content specifications.\n2. Generate new content that precisely fulfills these specifications, maintaining the established tone, style, and technical depth.\n3. Replace only the instruction block (including delimiters) with the generated content, ensuring logical flow and integration with the surrounding text.\n4. Preserve all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, ---keytakeaways---) exactly as they appear.\n5. Review the final document to ensure a cohesive, seamless experience for the target learner.",
