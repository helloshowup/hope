The foods you eat before playing basketball, running in PE class, or riding bikes with friends affect both how well you perform and how you feel afterward. Eating the right foods at the right times gives you energy to play longer, helps build stronger muscles, and speeds up how quickly you recover.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model uses a simple plate diagram to show what balanced meals look like. A healthy plate includes:\n- **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and berries provide quick energy and important vitamins\n- **Vegetables**: Carrots, broccoli, and spinach contain minerals and vitamins that keep your body working properly\n- **Grains**: Bread, pasta, and rice fuel your activities with long-lasting energy (brown and whole grain versions work best)\n- **Protein**: Chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts help repair and build your muscles\n- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain calcium that strengthens your bones\n\nWhen you include foods from each group in your meals, your body gets all the nutrients it needs.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nEating a small snack 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body fuel to perform well. Try these pre-workout snacks:\n\n- **Banana with peanut butter**: Bananas provide quick energy while peanut butter adds protein that helps that energy last\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: The fruit gives immediate energy while cheese adds staying power\n- **Yogurt with berries**: This combination digests easily and provides both quick and sustained energy\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These complex carbohydrates release energy steadily during your activity\n\nKeep your pre-workout snack small - just enough to fuel you without feeling heavy in your stomach.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nYour body needs specific nutrients after exercise to recover properly. Eating within 30 minutes after finishing activity helps your muscles rebuild stronger. Good recovery foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: This tasty drink contains an excellent ratio of carbohydrates to protein that helps muscles recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The lean meat repairs muscle tissue while the wrap replenishes energy stores\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Blending these ingredients creates an easy-to-digest mix of proteins and carbs\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: This Middle Eastern combo provides plant protein and energy-restoring carbohydrates\n\nDrink plenty of water after sweating! Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels reveal what's actually in the products you buy. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)\n- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body\n- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones\n- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources\n- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed\n\n## Over to You\nFind two similar snacks in your kitchen. Compare their labels side by side. Which would work better before playing sports? Which seems better for after? Write down your reasoning. You might also track your food for a day by drawing a plate for each meal and marking which food groups you included. This visual record shows whether you're getting a good balance according to the MyPlate model.\n\nThe foods you choose before and after being active directly affect your energy levels, strength, and recovery. Using the MyPlate model as a guide, selecting appropriate snacks for before and after exercise, and understanding food labels helps you make better choices. When you fuel your body properly, you'll have more stamina, build stronger muscles, and bounce back faster from all your physical activities!\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Quality Assurance & Practical Implementation Review\n\nReview and refine educational content that has been transformed from classroom-based to online learning, ensuring practical effectiveness beyond technical compliance.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a critical assessment by identifying:\n1. Superficial transformations that merely shifted perspective without meaningful adaptation\n2. Self-directed instructions that remain impractical for independent learning\n3. Activities that still implicitly require a classroom, teacher, or group setting\n4. Assessment components that lack clear self-evaluation mechanisms\n5. Instances where the spirit of adaptation was not fulfilled despite technical compliance\n\n## CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. PRACTICAL ADAPTATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Convert superficial self-prompts to genuinely independent activities\n   - Replace \"ask yourself\" or \"give yourself prompts\" with concrete, actionable tasks\n   - Transform timed assessments to milestone-based progress measurements\n   - Provide specific success criteria for self-assessment\n   \n2. IMPLEMENTATION CLARITY (IMPORTANT):\n   - Add specific setup instructions for home-based learning environment\n   - Provide concrete alternatives for any specialized equipment\n   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common implementation challenges\n   - Clarify exactly how to perform and evaluate each activity independently\n   \n3. LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS (SUPPORTING):\n   - Ensure each activity reinforces specific learning objectives\n   - Add self-reflection components that guide deeper understanding\n   - Include examples of completed activities where helpful\n   - Provide multiple difficulty options for diverse learning needs\n\n## REVISION GUIDELINES:\n1. Maintain structural integrity while making practical adaptations\n2. Focus specifically on transforming content that merely \"shifted voice\" to the learner\n3. Replace any remaining classroom-dependent elements with truly independent alternatives\n4. Convert assessments from testing frameworks to learning reinforcement\n5. Preserve educational substance while ensuring practical effectiveness\n\nThis quality assurance review ensures the transformed content is genuinely effective for independent, asynchronous learning - not just technically compliant with transformation requirements.",

Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels reveal what's actually in the products you buy. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)\n- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body\n- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones\n- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources\n- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed\n\n## Food Label Comparison Activity\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Find two similar snack items in your kitchen (examples: two granola bars, two types of crackers, or two breakfast cereals)\n2. Place them side by side on a table with good lighting\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready, or use a digital note-taking app\n4. If you don't have similar snacks available, use online images of nutrition labels (search \"nutrition label granola bar\" for examples)\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Create a simple comparison chart with these categories:\n   - Product name\n   - Serving size\n   - Calories per serving\n   - Protein amount\n   - Carbohydrate amount\n   - Sugar amount\n   - Number of ingredients\n\n2. Fill in your chart with information from both food labels\n\n3. Answer these specific questions:\n   - Which snack has more protein per serving?\n   - Which has fewer added sugars?\n   - Which has more recognizable ingredients?\n   - Which would provide quicker energy? Which would provide longer-lasting energy?\n\n### Success Criteria:\nYou've successfully completed this activity when you have:\n- Filled in all categories in your comparison chart\n- Answered all four analysis questions\n- Identified which snack would work better before exercise and which would be better after exercise, with at least two specific reasons for each choice\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n- If you can't find the added sugar amount, look at the ingredients list - ingredients are listed by quantity, so if sugar appears early in the list, there's likely more of it\n- If you don't have food items available, ask a family member to describe labels to you or use online resources\n- If you're unsure about an ingredient, look it up online to learn what it is\n\n## MyPlate Tracking Activity\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Get a piece of paper and drawing supplies (pencil, markers, or crayons)\n2. Set up a quiet space where you can think about your meals from today or yesterday\n3. Draw a large circle on your paper to represent a plate\n4. Divide your circle into four sections, with a small circle beside it (like the MyPlate model)\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. For each meal you ate today (or yesterday):\n   - Draw a new plate diagram\n   - Label the sections: Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, and Protein, with Dairy beside the plate\n   - Color in how much of each food group you actually ate (for example, if half your breakfast was eggs, color in half the protein section)\n\n2. After completing all your meal plates, answer these reflection questions:\n   - Which food group did you eat the most of throughout the day?\n   - Which food group might you need to include more of tomorrow?\n   - Name one specific change you could make to better balance your plate at a particular meal\n\n### Success Criteria:\nYou've successfully completed this activity when you have:\n- Created plate diagrams for at least three meals\n- Accurately represented the proportions of food groups in each meal\n- Answered all three reflection questions\n- Identified at least one specific, realistic change to improve your meal balance\n\n### Example of a Completed Plate:\nBreakfast Plate:\n- Protein section (1/4 filled): Scrambled eggs\n- Grains section (1/2 filled): Toast\n- Fruits section (1/4 filled): Banana slices\n- Vegetables section (empty)\n- Dairy circle (1/2 filled): Glass of milk\n\nThe foods you choose before and after being active directly affect your energy levels, strength, and recovery. Using the MyPlate model as a guide, selecting appropriate snacks for before and after exercise, and understanding food labels helps you make better choices. When you fuel your body properly, you'll have more stamina, build stronger muscles, and bounce back faster from all your physical activities!"
