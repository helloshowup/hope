  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of mindful movement activities and resources for middle school students to stay physically active. It covers key topics such as identifying local places to be active, finding free/low-cost fitness options, and evaluating online workout videos. The content is structured with clear learning objectives, materials needed, and step-by-step activities to engage learners.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests the following:\n1. Add linking paragraphs to the existing content to improve flow and readability, avoiding an overly \"AI-generated\" tone.\n2. Preserve all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, ---keytakeaways---) that serve pedagogical functions.\n3. Ensure the final enhanced content appears as a cohesive whole with no trace of the original instruction blocks.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: English-speaking students\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical Space/Equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday language, short sentences, and a conversational tone to engage this middle school audience. Visuals, step-by-step instructions, and real-world examples will be crucial to support their learning.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no opportunity for peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained, with clear explanations and minimal reliance on external resources. Formatting should be optimized for easy reading and navigation on digital devices.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and learning objectives of the original content\n- Enhance the flow and readability of the text without altering the core information\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to the 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Incorporate more visual elements (images, diagrams, illustrations) to support the target learners\n- Provide creative solutions for equipment and space limitations in home environments\n- Preserve all special marker tags that serve specific pedagogical functions\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content thoroughly to understand the key themes, concepts, and structure.\n2. Analyze the enhancement prompt and target learner profile to identify specific areas for improvement.\n3. Craft seamless transitional paragraphs to connect the existing content sections, maintaining the instructional tone.\n4. Incorporate more visual elements (images, diagrams, illustrations) to support the 11-14 year old audience.\n5. Simplify language, examples, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level.\n6. Suggest alternative equipment and space-saving options for the home-based learning environment.\n7. Ensure all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, ---keytakeaways---) remain intact and in their original locations.\n8. Review the enhanced content as a whole to verify a cohesive, polished final product that preserves the original intent.",

Most neighborhoods have parks with:\n\nI've always loved exploring the parks in my neighborhood. When I was your age, the local park was like my second home after school. My friends and I would meet up almost every day to shoot hoops or just run around until dinner time.\n\nParks are amazing because they change with the seasons too. In summer, the wide open fields are perfect for frisbee or soccer, while in fall, the walking paths become even more beautiful with colorful leaves crunching under your feet. No matter what kind of movement you enjoy, parks usually have something for everyone.\n\n- Walking paths\n- Open fields for running or games\n- Playgrounds with climbing equipment\n- Basketball or tennis courts\n\n**Activity: Park Finder**\n1. List the names of 2-3 parks closest to your home\n2. For each park, write down:\n\n- How to get there (walking, biking, car, bus)\n- 3 specific activities you could do there\n- Any equipment you would need to bring\n\n*Example:*\n```\nLincoln Park\n\n- Can walk there (15 minutes)\n- Activities: basketball, walking the trail, using the playground equipment\n- Need to bring: basketball, water bottle, sun protection\n```\n\n### Community Centers\nMost towns have community centers that offer:\n\nWhen I first visited our local community center, I was surprised by how much was happening inside! There were kids playing basketball in the gym, others swimming in the pool, and a group taking a hip-hop dance class. It felt like a hidden treasure in our town.\n\nCommunity centers are especially great during bad weather when you can't be outside. Many offer day passes if you just want to try something out, and they often have special events on weekends or during school breaks. Some even have game rooms with ping pong tables or areas where you can just hang out with friends while being active.\n\n- Swimming pools\n- Gyms for basketball or volleyball\n- Exercise classes for kids and teens\n- Sports teams you can join\n\nThese centers usually have affordable programs or sometimes free days for students. Check your local center's website or call to ask about student discounts.\n\n### Other Cool Places\nDon't forget these active spots in your area:\n\nHave you ever noticed how many places for movement are hiding in plain sight? Just last weekend, I discovered a bike trail behind the shopping center that I never knew existed, even though I've lived here for years! Sometimes the best activity spots are the ones you stumble upon by accident.\n\nYour own neighborhood probably has secret spots perfect for being active. That empty lot where kids play kickball, the stairs at the library that make a great workout, or even the sidewalk outside your home where you can practice skateboarding tricks. Being active doesn't always mean going to an \"official\" place – sometimes the best movement happens in everyday spaces that you make your own.\n\n- Bike paths or walking trails\n- School playgrounds (after school hours)\n- Skating rinks\n- Bowling alleys\n- Dance studios with beginner classes\n\n## Finding Information About Activities\n\n### How to Find Out What's Available\nYou can discover activities near you in several ways:\n\nFinding fun activities used to be much harder before the internet! When I was growing up, we had to look through the newspaper or call places directly to find out what was happening. Now, information is everywhere – which can actually make it a bit overwhelming to sort through all the options.\n\nThe trick is to start with what interests you most. Do you like team sports? Individual activities? Being outdoors? Once you have an idea of what sounds fun, it's easier to search for specific opportunities. Don't be afraid to try something completely new, either. Some of the most enjoyable activities are ones you never expected to like until you gave them a chance!\n\n<br/>\n1. **Look online:** Visit your city's website or parks department page\n2. **Scan bulletin boards:** Check libraries and grocery stores for activity flyers\n3. **Ask around:** Talk to family members about activities they know about\n4. **Social media:** Local community groups often post about upcoming events\n\n### Activity: Become a Fitness Detective\nComplete this research chart for one place in your community:\n\n| Information to Find | Your Findings |\n|---------------------|---------------|\n| Name of location | |\n| Complete address | |\n| Hours open | |\n| Cost (if any) | |\n| 3 activities available there | |\n| Equipment needed | |\n| Transportation options | |\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- If you can't find information online, write down the phone number to call\n- If the location costs money, look for \"free days\" or student discounts\n- If transportation is difficult, look for a closer alternative\n\n## Free and Low-Cost Ways to Stay Active\n\nBeing active doesn't have to empty your wallet! In fact, some of the most fun ways to move your body cost absolutely nothing. Think about it – running, dancing, and playing tag are all free activities that people have enjoyed for generations.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, my friends and I rarely had money for fancy sports equipment or classes. Instead, we made up games using whatever we had around. We'd use a rolled-up sock as a ball or draw hopscotch grids with chalk. Those simple activities were just as fun as anything that required expensive gear, and we could do them anytime we wanted.\n\nYou don't need expensive gear or gym memberships to get moving! Here are affordable ways to be active:\n\n### At Parks or Outside\n\nSome of my best childhood memories involve playing outside until the streetlights came on. There's something special about moving your body in the fresh air that just feels different from indoor activities. The park near my house had this big hill that we'd race up and down until we were completely out of breath – no equipment needed, just our own two feet and a lot of energy to burn!\n\n- Walking or jogging around your block\n- Playing catch with someone\n- Jumping rope (ropes cost just a few dollars)\n- Making an obstacle course with sticks, rocks, or other objects\n- Going on a nature scavenger hunt\n\n### At Home\n\nRainy days used to feel like such a bummer when I couldn't go outside to play. That's when I learned to get creative with indoor movement. My sister and I would push the coffee table aside and have dance contests in the living room. Mom wasn't always thrilled with our noise level, but she was happy we were staying active instead of just sitting around complaining about the weather.\n\n- Dancing to music you like\n- Making a hopscotch grid with masking tape\n- Using stairs for exercise\n- Lifting water bottles as weights\n- Playing active games like Simon Says or Freeze Tag\n\n**Equipment Alternatives:**\n- No jump rope? Use a regular rope or cord\n- No weights? Fill water bottles or use canned food items\n- No sports equipment? Make balls from rolled-up socks\n- No exercise mat? Use a folded blanket or towel\n- No cones for marking? Use plastic cups or water bottles\n\n**Safety Checklist:**\n- [ ] I have told an adult where I'll be exercising\n- [ ] I am staying in a safe, well-lit area\n- [ ] I have water with me\n- [ ] I am wearing appropriate shoes and clothing\n- [ ] I have a plan if I need help (phone, nearby adult)\n\n## Online Workouts When You Can't Go Out\n\nSometimes getting outside just isn't an option. Maybe it's pouring rain, or maybe you're stuck at home waiting for a delivery. Whatever the reason, those indoor days don't have to mean sitting still. The internet has opened up a whole world of movement options that you can do right in your living room, no matter what the weather is doing outside.\n\nWhen the weather is bad or you can't leave home, online workouts are a great option. Many free workout videos exist specifically for middle schoolers!\n\n### Types of Online Workouts\n\nThe variety of online workouts is pretty amazing these days. When I first started looking for workout videos, I expected boring exercise routines, but instead found everything from zombie-themed fitness games to dance workouts featuring my favorite songs. There's literally something for every interest and energy level, which makes it much easier to find something you'll actually want to do.\n\n- Dance videos\n- Yoga for kids\n- Bodyweight exercises\n- Sports skill practice\n- Martial arts basics\n\n### Finding Safe Online Workouts\nGood workout videos should:\n\nNot all workout videos are created equal, especially for middle school students. I remember trying to follow along with an adult workout once and feeling completely lost (and a little sore the next day!). The best videos for your age group explain things clearly and show modifications if something is too challenging. They should make you feel good about moving your body, not frustrated or left behind.\n\n- Target kids or teens specifically\n- Give clear instructions\n- Show how to move correctly to avoid injuries\n- Use minimal equipment\n- Last an appropriate time (start with 10-15 minutes)\n\n**Online Workout Selection Activity:**\n1.
