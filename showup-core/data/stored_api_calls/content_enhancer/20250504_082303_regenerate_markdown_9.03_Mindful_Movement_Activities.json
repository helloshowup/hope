  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on \"Mindful Movement Activities\" for a physical education course. It covers various ways for middle school students to stay active in their local communities, including free or low-cost options. The module includes learning objectives, materials needed, and several sections that provide information, activities, and tips for finding and engaging in different types of physical activities.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\nThe key requirements for transforming this classroom-based content into asynchronous online learning are:\n\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain all original section headings exactly as written, except remove the \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content.\n   - Keep the identical section sequence and numbering.\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references.\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all group activities to individual activities.\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions.\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options.\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements.\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs.\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms.\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) with varying exposure to physical education concepts and limited formal PE instruction. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Language and Readability: Keep content at a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday words, active voice, and direct instructions.\n- Structure and Organization: Use frequent headings, short paragraphs, numbered steps, and visual breaks to create clear \"chunks\" of information.\n- Visual Elements: Include relevant images, diagrams, labeled illustrations, and visual examples for each new exercise or activity.\n- Engagement Strategies: Connect to real-world examples, use a conversational tone, incorporate \"Stop and Think\" moments, and create achievable challenges.\n- Equipment and Space Considerations: Provide alternatives using common household items and adaptations for small or shared living spaces.\n- Safety Guidelines: Offer clear safety warnings, warm-up/cool-down instructions, modified versions, and guidance on proper form.\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed for asynchronous online delivery, with no peer interaction. Key considerations include:\n\n- Removing all group activities and teacher-led facilitation in favor of self-guided instructions.\n- Converting timed components to self-paced elements.\n- Adapting assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and self-assessment mechanisms.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Preserve the original content's core educational value and learning objectives.\n- Maintain the structural integrity of the module by keeping all section headings, sequence, and numbering.\n- Adapt the content to enable effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.\n- Ensure the language, visuals, and engagement strategies are appropriate for the 11-14 year old target audience.\n- Provide alternatives and adaptations to accommodate the limited access to specialized equipment and varying home environments.\n\n# Suggested Approach\n1. Begin by carefully reviewing the current content to fully understand the module's purpose, structure, and educational progression.\n2. Extract the specific requirements from the enhancement prompt, ensuring you address all critical, important, and supporting elements.\n3. Analyze the target learner profile and incorporate the necessary adaptations for language, visuals, engagement, equipment, and safety considerations.\n4. Identify all group activities, teacher-led facilitation, timed components, and assessment elements, then transform them for effective asynchronous online delivery.\n5. Maintain the original section headings, sequence, and numbering while adapting only the content within each section.\n6. Preserve the core educational value and learning objectives of the module throughout the transformation process.\n7. Review the final enhanced content to ensure it meets all the requirements outlined in the preparatory context.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
