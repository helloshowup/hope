Power management strategies help robots work longer between charges, just like how we try to make our phone batteries last all day.\n\nRobots use several smart ways to save power, similar to how we turn off lights when leaving a room:\n\nSleep modes let robots temporarily shut down parts they don't need right now. Think of a security robot that might turn off its wheels while standing guard, but keep its cameras on to watch for trouble.\n\nDynamic power scaling changes how much power parts use based on what the robot is doing. When a robot is doing something easy, it can use less power (like dimming a light). When it needs to do something hard, it can use more power.\n\nEfficient motion planning helps robots move using the least amount of energy. Instead of always taking the shortest path, a robot might avoid hills or bumpy ground that would drain its battery faster. Some robots also use momentum - like rolling downhill - to save energy.\n\nBy using these techniques together, robots can work much longer between charges, making them more useful in the real world.\n\n## **Power Monitoring Systems**\n\nSmart robots keep track of their power usage to make better decisions:\n\nBattery management systems constantly check the battery's charge level, temperature, and health. This is like having a fuel gauge that tells you not just how much gas is left, but also if there's something wrong with your car's engine.\n\nPower prediction algorithms help robots guess how much energy they'll need later. For example, a delivery robot might figure out if it has enough battery to deliver all its packages before needing to recharge.\n\nEnergy-aware decision making lets robots change what they're doing based on how much power they have left. When a robot's battery gets low, it might only do the most important jobs, slow down to save energy, or find the nearest charging station.\n\nThese monitoring systems help robots work more reliably and avoid getting stuck with dead batteries.\n\n## **Charging and Maintenance**\n\nKeeping robot power systems in good shape is important:\n\nCharging systems for robots range from simple plug-in stations to cool automatic docking stations. Some robots can find their charging stations by themselves when their batteries run low. Newer charging systems include wireless charging pads that robots can just park on top of to recharge.\n\nBattery maintenance helps keep robots running well over time. This includes charging them properly, keeping them out of very hot or cold places, and sometimes doing special charging routines to keep the batteries healthy.\n\nMaximizing power source lifespan means taking good care of batteries. For example, some batteries last longer if they're kept between 20% and 80% charged instead of always charging to 100%. Smart robots can follow these rules automatically.\n\nGood maintenance not only helps robots run longer between charges but also makes their batteries last more years before needing replacement.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots use energy-saving techniques like sleep modes, power scaling, and smart movement paths to make their batteries last longer.\n- Power monitoring systems help robots track battery levels and make smart decisions about when to complete tasks or find a charging station.\n- Regular battery maintenance and proper charging habits extend a robot's operating time and overall battery life.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n## **Activity 2: Power Planning Challenge**\n\nDesign power solutions for robots with specific operational requirements. Choose one scenario: (1) An agricultural robot operating 12-hour shifts in varying weather, (2) A hospital assistant robot needing continuous operation, or (3) A search-and-rescue robot for disaster zones. Select appropriate power sources, justify your choices, and explain how your design addresses the specific constraints of your chosen scenario.",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on \"Power Management Strategies\" for robotics.

This means the formatting and structure must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without the support of an instructor or classmates. Considerations include:\n\n- Ensure clear, self-explanatory instructions and explanations.\n- Incorporate visual aids to support understanding in the absence of live demonstrations.\n- Maintain a logical flow and organization that is easy to navigate for the learner.\n- Avoid reliance on external resources or activities that require specialized equipment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Preserve the educational integrity and learning objectives of the original content.\n2. Enhance the content's readability and engagement for the target middle school audience.\n3. Ensure the formatting changes are surgical and minimally invasive, maintaining the original structure and flow.\n4. Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium while avoiding overly prescriptive formatting.\n5. Provide strategic guidance for improvement while upholding the core value of the existing material.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Apply bold formatting to all section headers, important concept labels, and key terms throughout the content.\n2. Ensure proper paragraph separation with exactly one empty line between paragraphs.\n3. Review the content for readability and engagement, making minor adjustments to sentence structure, word choice, and visual elements as needed to align with the target learner profile.\n4. Maintain the overall content organization and flow, avoiding any structural changes beyond the specified formatting enhancements.\n5. Verify that the transformed content matches the original in terms of word count, logical integrity, and consistency of formatting application.\n6. Provide the enhanced content as a foundation for further development, focusing on strategic guidance rather than specific edits.",
