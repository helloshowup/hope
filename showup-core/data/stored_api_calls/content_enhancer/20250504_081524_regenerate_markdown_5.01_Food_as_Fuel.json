Have them share typical pre-PE or sports practice snacks. Show a brief 1-2 minute video clip of athletes discussing their pre-game nutrition. Then explain that today's lesson will explore how different foods provide energy and building blocks for movement, play, and strength development.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients (15-20 minutes)\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs are your body's preferred fuel - similar to petrol in a car\n   - Found in foods like bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body breaks them down into glucose (sugar) that powers your muscles\n   - Without enough carbs, you might feel tired or weak during activities\n   - Demonstration: Have students do 10 jumping jacks, then explain how carbs powered that movement\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n   - Proteins are like building blocks that help repair and grow your muscles\n   - Found in foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts\n   - When you exercise, tiny tears form in your muscles - protein helps fix them\n   - This repair process is what makes your muscles stronger over time\n   - Visual aid: Show before/after pictures of a growing plant to represent muscle growth\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n   - Healthy fats are like slow-burning candles that provide energy for longer activities\n   - Found in avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish\n   - Fats also protect your organs and help your body absorb certain vitamins\n   - Your brain needs fats to work properly too!\n   - Note: While fats are important, we need smaller amounts compared to carbs and protein\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives (10-15 minutes)\n- Divide class into small groups of 3-4 students\n- Give each group a set of food cards with pictures and names of common foods\n- Challenge: Sort the cards into three piles - \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n- For mixed foods (like pizza), discuss which nutrients they contain\n- Come back together and review answers as a class\n- Fun fact: Many foods contain more than one nutrient!\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity (15-20 minutes)\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  * 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  * 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  * After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- Create a \"Perfect Plate\" model showing:\n  * 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  * 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  * 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  * Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Examples of balanced meals and snacks you can easily make:\n  * Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  * Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  * Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  * Chocolate milk after a workout (natural protein and carbs!)\n\n## Over to You (5-10 minutes)\n- Quick review game: \"Nutrient or Not?\" - call out a nutrient function and give thumbs up if true\n- Exit ticket activity: Create a \"My Performance Plate\" drawing showing what you would eat:\n  * Before your favourite physical activity\n  * After your favourite physical activity\n- Homework challenge: Try one new performance-boosting food this week and report back\n- Final message: \"The food you eat is the fuel for everything you do. Choose your fuel wisely to perform your best!\"\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational lesson on the three main nutrients that power the body for physical activity: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It covers the role and importance of each nutrient, provides hands-on activities to reinforce learning, and offers guidance on how to fuel up before and after exercise. The lesson is structured with clear learning objectives, interactive demonstrations, group work, and a final reflection/application exercise.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n\n1. **Structural Integrity**: Maintain the original section headings, sequence, and numbering exactly as written, with the exception of removing the \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content.\n\n2. **Content Adaptation**: Convert all group activities to individual activities, replace teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions, adapt classroom/equipment references to home environment options, and convert timed components to self-paced elements.\n\n3. **Assessment Adaptation**: Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience for this enhanced content is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an asynchronous online physical education course at Excel Middle School. Key considerations for this learner profile include:\n\n- **Reading Level**: Keep content at a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday language, active voice, and short sentences.\n- **Prior Knowledge**: Vary explanations and examples to accommodate students with limited formal physical education experience.\n- **Learning Style**: Emphasize visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities that can be done independently.\n- **Physical Space/Equipment**: Provide alternatives using common household items and adapt activities for small spaces and varying surfaces.\n- **Safety**: Include clear safety warnings, warm-up/cool-down instructions, and modified versions for different physical abilities.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed from a classroom-based lesson to asynchronous online learning material. Key limitations and considerations for this medium include:\n\n- No peer interaction or teacher facilitation, so all activities must be self-guided.\n- No specialized equipment or facilities available, so all references to classroom resources must be adapted.\n- No timed components or synchronous elements, so all time-dependent aspects must be converted to self-paced.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. **Maintain Educational Integrity**: Preserve the core concepts, learning objectives, and flow of the original lesson while adapting for independent online learning.\n2. **Enhance Engagement**: Incorporate more storytelling, real-world connections, and interactive elements to keep students motivated and focused.\n3. **Optimize for Asynchronous Delivery**: Ensure all instructions are clear and self-explanatory, with ample visual support and opportunities for self-assessment.\n4. **Emphasize Safety and Accessibility**: Provide detailed safety guidance, equipment alternatives, and modifications for different physical abilities and home environments.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. **Structural Preservation**: Maintain the original section headings, sequence, and numbering exactly as written, with the exception of removing the \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content.\n2. **Activity Adaptation**: Convert all group activities to individual activities, replace teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions, and adapt classroom/equipment references to home environment options.\n3. **Assessment Transformation**: Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms.\n4. **Content Optimization**: Simplify language, add more visual aids, incorporate storytelling elements, and create clear, step-by-step instructions for all activities.\n5. **Safety and Accessibility**: Provide detailed safety warnings, equipment alternatives, and modified versions for different physical abilities and home environments.\n\nBy following this preparatory context, the enhanced content will preserve the original educational integrity while effectively transforming the material for asynchronous online delivery to the target 11-14 year old learners.",

What snacks do you usually have before playing sports or being active? Many professional athletes carefully choose what they eat before competing. Today's lesson will explore how different foods provide energy and building blocks for movement, play, and strength development.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients (15-20 minutes)\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs are your body's preferred fuel - similar to petrol in a car\n   - Found in foods like bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body breaks them down into glucose (sugar) that powers your muscles\n   - Without enough carbs, you might feel tired or weak during activities\n   - Try it yourself: Do 10 jumping jacks, then notice how your body used carbs to power that movement\n\n2.
