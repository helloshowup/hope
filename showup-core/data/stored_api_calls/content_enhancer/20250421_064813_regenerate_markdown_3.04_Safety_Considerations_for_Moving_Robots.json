A small educational robot might cause minor injuries if it runs into someone's foot, while a large industrial robot arm could cause serious harm if it hits a person. Similarly, a fast-moving drone presents different safety challenges than a slow-moving robot vacuum.\n\n**Robotics engineers** address these safety concerns through careful design, programming, and testing. They implement both **physical safety features** (like bumpers or lightweight materials) and **intelligent programming** (like obstacle detection and avoidance). Many robots also include **emergency stop functions** that immediately halt all movement if a problem is detected.\n\nAs robots become more common in our daily lives, understanding these safety considerations becomes increasingly important for everyone who interacts with them.\n\nWhen robots operate in public spaces like schools, parks, or shopping centers, there are additional considerations. Communities often create rules about where and when robots can operate. For example, some neighborhoods have guidelines about how delivery robots should behave on sidewalks, including how fast they can move and when they should yield to pedestrians. These rules help ensure that robots and people can safely share the same spaces.\n\n### **Physical Safety Features**\n\nMoving robots include many physical safety features to prevent accidents and injuries. These built-in protections help robots interact safely with people and objects in their environment.\n\nMany robots have **soft, rounded exteriors** without sharp edges. This design minimizes potential harm if contact occurs. Some robots even have **padded or cushioned exteriors** that can absorb impact, similar to bumpers on cars.\n\n**Weight and speed limitations** are also important safety features. Educational robots are typically lightweight so they won't cause injury if they bump into someone. **Industrial robots** often operate at reduced speeds when people are nearby or have safety cages to keep people at a safe distance.\n\n**Mechanical stops** prevent robots from moving beyond safe limits. For example, a robot arm might have physical barriers that prevent it from extending too far. Some robots include **force-sensing capabilities** that detect when they encounter resistance and stop pushing.\n\n**Emergency stop buttons** (often bright red) allow humans to immediately shut down a robot if necessary. These buttons cut power to the motors, bringing all movement to an immediate halt.\n\nThese physical safety features work together with the robot's programming to create multiple layers of protection against accidents.\n\n### **Awareness and Predictability**\n\nBeyond physical safety features, robots need to be aware of their surroundings and move in ways that are predictable to humans. This helps people feel comfortable and safe around moving robots.\n\nMany robots use **sensors** to maintain awareness of their environment, including:\n- **Cameras** that help robots \"see\" people and objects\n- **Proximity sensors** that detect when something is nearby\n- **Pressure sensors** that feel when contact has been made\n- **Lidar or radar systems** that map the surrounding area\n\nThis sensor information helps robots avoid collisions and adjust their movements based on what's happening around them.\n\n**Predictability** is equally important for safety. Robots should move in ways that humans can anticipate. This is why many robots:\n- Use lights or sounds to signal when they're about to move\n- Move at consistent speeds rather than suddenly accelerating\n- Follow expected paths rather than making unexpected turns\n- Maintain safe distances from people when possible\n\nSome advanced robots even use **artificial intelligence** to predict human movements and adjust accordingly. For example, a delivery robot in a crowded hallway might slow down when approaching an intersection where people might suddenly appear.\n\nWhen robots are both aware of their surroundings and move predictably, people can safely share spaces with them.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how a robot vacuum knows when to change direction. What inputs might it use, and how does its processor decide on movement?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich of the following BEST describes why movement is considered an output function in robotics?\n\nA. Movement happens before a robot can process information\n\nB. Movement is how robots respond to their programming and sensor inputs\n\nC. Movement is only used by robots to collect new information\n\nD. Movement is what robots use instead of sensors\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Movement is how robots respond to their programming and sensor inputs. Movement is considered an output function because it's how robots respond to or act upon the information they've processed from their inputs (like sensors). Movement is the result of processing, not the start of it.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots use **physical safety features** like soft exteriors, weight limits, and emergency stop buttons to prevent accidents when moving around people.\n- **Sensors** help robots \"see\" their surroundings, allowing them to detect and avoid obstacles before collisions happen.\n- Safe robots move in **predictable ways**—using signals before moving, maintaining consistent speeds, and following expected paths—so people can safely share spaces with them.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
