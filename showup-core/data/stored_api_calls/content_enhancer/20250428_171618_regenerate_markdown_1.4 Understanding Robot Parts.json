They convert physical properties (like light, sound, or pressure) into electrical signals that the robot's processing system can understand.\n\nLet's explore some common sensor types:\n\n**Contact Sensors** detect physical touch or pressure. These include:\n- **Bump sensors** that activate when a robot collides with something\n- **Pressure sensors** that measure how hard something is pressing\n- **Tactile sensors** that can detect texture or shape through touch\n\n**Distance Sensors** measure how far away objects are without touching them:\n- **Ultrasonic sensors** send out sound waves and measure how long they take to bounce back\n- **Infrared sensors** use infrared light to detect obstacles\n- **Lidar sensors** use laser light to create detailed 3D maps of surroundings\n\n**Environmental Sensors** measure conditions in the robot's environment:\n- **Temperature sensors** detect heat levels\n- **Humidity sensors** measure moisture in the air\n- **Light sensors** detect brightness levels or specific colors\n- **Sound sensors** pick up noises and can sometimes recognize specific sounds\n\n**Position Sensors** help a robot understand where it is and how it's oriented:\n- **GPS receivers** determine location on Earth\n- **Accelerometers** measure acceleration and can detect which way is down\n- **Gyroscopes** measure rotation and help maintain balance\n- **Encoders** track the position of motors and wheels\n\n**Vision Sensors** allow robots to \"see\" their environment:\n- **Cameras** capture images that can be analyzed\n- **Depth cameras** create 3D representations of scenes\n- **Barcode or QR code readers** identify specific markers\n\nThe sensors a robot has determine what kinds of information it can gather. A robot designed to navigate outdoors might need GPS and cameras, while a robot that works in dark environments might rely more on touch and ultrasonic sensors.\n\n### Processing Units (Thinking Devices)\n\nThe **processing unit** is the \"brain\" of a robot, responsible for making sense of sensor data and deciding what actions to take.\n\nHardware Components:\n- **Microcontrollers** are small, simple computers used in simpler robots.\n- **Single-board computers** like Raspberry Pi provide more computing power.\n- **Specialized processors** like GPUs assist with vision processing and AI tasks.\n- **Memory chips** store the robot's programming and temporary data.\n\nSoftware Components:\n- **Operating System**: Manages basic robot functions.\n- **Control Programs**: Specific instructions for different situations.\n- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures for solving problems.\n- **Artificial Intelligence**: Enables learning and adaptation.\n\nProcessing approaches include:\n- **Reactive Processing**: Direct responses to sensor input.\n- **Deliberative Processing**: Builds an internal model and plans actions.\n- **Hybrid Processing**: Combines reactive and deliberative strategies.\n\n\n### Actuators (Output Devices)\n\n**Actuators** are the components that allow robots to take action and affect their environment.\n\n**Motion Actuators** create movement:\n- **DC Motors**: Continuous rotation.\n- **Servo Motors**: Rotate to specific positions.\n- **Stepper Motors**: Move in precise increments.\n- **Linear Actuators**: Create straight-line motion.\n- **Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuators**: Use fluid or air pressure.\n\n**Grippers and Manipulators**:\n- **Mechanical grippers**: Open and close fingers.\n- **Vacuum grippers**: Use suction.\n- **Soft grippers**: Handle delicate items.\n- **Specialized tools**: Like drills or welding tools.\n\n**Communication Actuators**:\n- **Speakers**: Produce sounds or speech.\n- **Display screens**: Show information.\n- **Lights**: Indicate status.\n- **Network transmitters**: Send data.\n\nOther Specialized Actuators:\n- **Heaters or coolers**: Change temperature.\n- **Pumps**: Move liquids.\n- **Valves**: Control flow of fluids or gases.\n\n\n\n### Stop and Reflect\n\nHow might the definition of a robot change in the future as technology advances?  \nConsider what new capabilities might be added to our current understanding of robots in the next decade.\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Sensors convert physical properties (like light, sound, or touch) into electrical signals that robots can understand.\n- Processing units range from simple microcontrollers to advanced computers with AI capabilities.\n- Actuators (like motors, grippers, and speakers) allow robots to move, manipulate objects, and communicate.\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance.\nAnother misconception is that all robots are autonomous. In reality, many robots require continuous human control and are not capable of making decisions on their own.\n\n## Types of Robot Control Systems\nThere are several methods for controlling robots, from direct manual control to fully autonomous operation.\n```\n\n**Transformed:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the essential components that make up a robot, including sensors, processing units, and actuators. It explains the different types of sensors robots can use to gather information about their environment, the hardware and software that make up a robot's \"brain\", and the various actuators that allow robots to take physical actions. The content also includes a \"Stop and Reflect\" section that prompts the learner to consider how the definition of a robot might evolve in the future.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt specifies five specific formatting changes to be made to the content:\n1. Add bold formatting to key terms and headers\n2. Ensure proper paragraph breaks with exactly one empty line between paragraphs\n3. Add strategic page breaks to divide the content into logical lesson segments\n4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" sections with special marker tags\n5. Format \"Check Your Understanding\" sections with specific opening and closing markers\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learner is a middle school student (ages 11-14) with varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly their first formal introduction to robotics. The content should be adapted to a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday language, active voice, and short sentences. Visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations should be incorporated to support understanding. The tone should be conversational and friendly, with opportunities for the learner to pause and reflect on the information.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the formatting and structure need to be clear and self-contained, with ample white space and visual breaks to support independent learning. Any \"Stop and Reflect\" or \"Check Your Understanding\" sections should be well-formatted to function effectively without an instructor present.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content\n- Address the specific formatting requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to suit the target middle school learner\n- Optimize the content structure and formatting for effective asynchronous online delivery\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Apply bold formatting to key terms, headers, and important concept labels to draw the learner's attention.\n2. Ensure proper paragraph breaks by adding exactly one empty line between paragraphs, preserving the original content structure.\n3. Strategically place page breaks to divide the content into logical lesson segments, avoiding disrupting explanations or splitting related concepts.\n4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" sections by adding special opening and closing marker tags to clearly identify these important reflection points.\n5. Transform \"Check Your Understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers, maintaining proper spacing and formatting for the multiple-choice questions and answers.\n6. Throughout the enhancement process, be mindful of preserving the original content's educational value and intent while adapting the language, examples, and formatting to best suit the target middle school learner in the asynchronous online environment.",
