Print the \"Food Detective\" worksheet or create a simple table in your notebook with columns for: Time, Food/Drink, Amount, Food Group, and How I Felt\n2. Keep your tracking sheet somewhere easily accessible (like on the refrigerator or in your backpack)\n3. Set reminders on your phone or place sticky notes where you'll see them to help you remember to record meals\n\n**Step 1: Food Tracking (1 day)**\n\n- Record everything you eat and drink for ONE day on your tracking sheet\n- For each item, write down:\n  - WHAT you ate (be specific - \"turkey sandwich with cheese and lettuce\" not just \"sandwich\")\n  - WHEN you ate it (actual time)\n  - HOW MUCH you ate (example: 1 cup, 2 slices, 1 medium apple)\n  - HOW you felt afterward (energized, tired, still hungry, satisfied, etc.)\n- Take pictures of your meals if that helps you remember details\n- If you forget to record something, add it as soon as you remember\n\n**Step 2: Food Group Analysis**\n- After your tracking day, review your food log and follow these steps:\n  1. Label each food item with its MyPlate group: Fruits (F), Vegetables (V), Grains (G), Protein (P), Dairy (D), or Other (O)\n  2. Count how many servings you had from each group and record the totals\n  3. Compare your totals to these daily targets:\n\n- Fruits: 1.5-2 cups\n- Vegetables: 2-3 cups\n- Grains: 5-7 ounces (at least half should be whole grains)\n- Protein: 5-6 ounces\n- Dairy: 3 cups\n  4. Highlight or circle foods that gave you energy\n  5. Put an X next to foods that made you feel tired or sluggish\n\n**Example of Completed Food Tracking:**\n```\nTime: 7:30am | Food/Drink: Bowl of cereal with milk and banana | Amount: 1 cup cereal, Â½ cup milk, 1 medium banana | Food Groups: G, D, F | How I Felt: Energized until about 10am\nTime: 10:15am | Food/Drink: Chocolate chip granola bar | Amount: 1 bar | Food Groups: G, O | How I Felt: Quick energy but hungry again by 11:30\n```\n\n**Step 3: Goal Setting**\n- Look at your food group analysis and identify ONE specific area that needs improvement. Examples:\n  - Not enough vegetables\n  - Too many sugary snacks\n  - Skipping breakfast\n  - Not drinking enough water\n- Complete the \"SMART Goal Builder\" worksheet by filling in each section:\n  - Specific: Exactly what will you do?\n  - Measurable: How will you track it?\n  - Achievable: Is this realistic for your situation?\n  - Relevant: How will this help your health?\n  - Time-bound: When will you start/finish?\n- Examples of strong SMART goals:\n  - \"I will add a fruit or vegetable to my after-school snack at least 4 days this week\"\n  - \"I will replace my sugary breakfast cereal with oatmeal topped with fruit 3 mornings this week\"\n  - \"I will fill my water bottle each morning and finish it before lunch, then refill and finish before dinner\"\n- Weak goals to avoid:\n  - \"I will eat healthier\" (too general)\n  - \"I will never eat junk food again\" (not realistic)\n  - \"I will eat 10 vegetables every day\" (too ambitious to start)\n\n## Common Challenges and Solutions\nHere's how to handle typical eating obstacles you might face:\n\n**Challenge: No time because of homework and activities**\n- **Practical Solution:** Sunday prep session - spend 15 minutes washing and cutting fruits and vegetables, then store in containers in the refrigerator\n- **Quick Grab Options:** \n  - Pre-portion trail mix into small containers or bags\n  - Stock your backpack with fruit that doesn't need refrigeration (apples, bananas)\n  - Keep single-serve nut butter packets to pair with crackers or fruit\n\n**Challenge: Limited access to kitchen or cooking tools**\n- **No-Cook Meal Ideas:**\n  - Sandwich wrap: tortilla + lunch meat + cheese + lettuce (roll up and eat)\n  - Protein box: hard-boiled eggs + cheese cubes + crackers + carrot sticks\n  - Breakfast parfait: layer yogurt + cereal + berries in a cup\n- **Kitchen Tools for Beginners:**\n  - If you can use a microwave: Learn to make scrambled eggs in a mug, instant oatmeal with fruit, or microwave baked potato\n  - If you can use a toaster: Try whole grain toast with avocado, peanut butter and banana, or melted cheese\n\n**Challenge: Weather keeps you inside**\n- **Indoor Movement Ideas:**\n  - Create a 5-minute workout routine (10 jumping jacks, 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups, repeat)\n  - Follow along with a YouTube exercise video appropriate for your space\n  - Walk up and down stairs for 5 minutes\n- **Brain-Boosting Indoor Day Foods:**\n  - Make a smoothie with yogurt, frozen berries, and spinach (the spinach taste disappears!)\n  - Try a warm bowl of oatmeal with walnuts and cinnamon\n  - Snack on oranges or bell peppers (high in vitamin C for immune support)\n\n**Challenge: Just not feeling motivated**\n- **Motivation Boosters:**\n  - Create a \"foods I've tried\" checklist and give yourself a non-food reward after trying 5 new healthy foods\n  - Start a simple journal noting how different foods affect your energy for activities you enjoy\n  - Take \"before and after\" photos of healthy meals you prepare\n  - Use a simple star chart and give yourself a star each day you meet your nutrition goal\n\n## Action Plan\nLet's turn your goal into reality!\n\n<br/>\n1. Complete your \"Nutrition Action Plan\" worksheet with these specific sections:\n\n- Write your SMART goal at the top\n- List these 3 concrete steps with specific details:\n- Step 1: What I'll do tomorrow (be specific)\n- Step 2: What I'll do in 3 days\n- Step 3: What I'll do in 1 week\n- Support person: Write the name of someone who can help (parent, sibling, friend) and exactly how they can help (examples: \"Mom can buy fruits when shopping\" or \"Brother can remind me to pack my snack\")\n- Progress tracking: Choose ONE of these methods:\n- Draw a simple chart with days of the week and check off when you meet your goal\n- Use a notes app on your phone to record daily progress\n- Take daily photos of meals that match your goal\n\n2. Self Check-In Guide:\n\n- Home situation check: List what foods are currently available at home that support your goal\n- Roadblock planning: Write down 2 specific things that might get in your way and one solution for each\n- Schedule a specific 5-minute check-in with yourself (example: \"Sunday at 7pm I will look at my tracking sheet and see how I did this week\")\n\n**Example of a Completed Action Plan:**\n```\nSMART Goal: I will include a vegetable with dinner at least 5 days this week.\n\n<br/>\nStep 1 (Tomorrow): I will ask my dad to include carrots with dinner tomorrow night.\nStep 2 (In 3 days): I will learn how to microwave frozen broccoli to add to my plate.\nStep 3 (In 1 week): I will try one new vegetable that I haven't eaten before.\n\n<br/>\nSupport person: Dad can help by making sure we have vegetables in the house.\n\n<br/>\nProgress tracking: I will put a star on the kitchen calendar each day I eat a vegetable with dinner.\n\n<br/>\nPotential roadblock: We might order pizza one night.\nSolution: I will ask for a side salad or add some carrot sticks to my meal.\n```\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] 1. Energy Tracking: On a piece of paper, create a simple chart with these columns:  - Time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)- Energy level (High, Medium, Low) Foods eaten in the previous meal 2. Fill in this chart for 3 different days and look for patterns. Answer these specific questions: - Which meals gave you the most energy?  What time of day do you usually feel most tired?, D id you notice any connection between certain foods and your energy levels?Write down two specific things you learned about your eating habits and energy levels. %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n<br/>\n\nSmall adjustments to your eating habits can dramatically affect your energy, sports performance, school focus, and overall well-being!

  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
