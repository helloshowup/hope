Ask yourself these key questions about your robot's mission:\n\n1. **Speed requirements**: Does your robot need to move quickly, or is slow and steady acceptable? Delivery robots often need speed to be efficient, while inspection robots might move slowly to capture detailed information.\n\n2. **Payload capacity**: How much weight does your robot need to carry? Heavier loads typically favor wheeled designs, which can support weight more efficiently. Legged robots often require more powerful motors and stronger structures to carry the same load.\n\n3. **Operating duration**: How long must your robot operate between charges? Energy-efficient wheeled designs can typically run longer on the same battery compared to legged robots.\n\n4. **Precision movement**: Does your task require precise positioning? Omnidirectional wheels might be ideal for exact movements in a factory, while a hexapod could provide stable positioning on uneven ground.\n\n5. **Obstacle handling**: Will your robot need to navigate around or over obstacles? Consider whether your robot can go around obstacles (favoring wheels) or needs to go over them (favoring legs).\n\nBy answering these questions, you can identify which movement capabilities are essential for your robot's success and which are less important, helping narrow down your options.\n\n### **Environmental Considerations**\n\nThe environment where your robot will operate is often the deciding factor between wheels and legs. Consider these environmental factors:\n\n1. **Surface type**: Smooth, hard surfaces like tile, concrete, or wood floors strongly favor wheeled designs. Uneven, soft, or discontinuous surfaces like gravel, sand, or forest floors may require legged robots to navigate effectively.\n\n2. **Obstacles**: Does the environment contain stairs, curbs, or other vertical challenges? Legs excel at handling changes in elevation, while most wheeled designs cannot climb steps without special mechanisms.\n\n3. **Space constraints**: Tight spaces may favor certain designs. Omnidirectional wheels can maneuver in crowded areas without needing much turning space, while legged robots might need room to position their feet.\n\n4. **Indoor vs. outdoor**: Indoor environments are typically more wheel-friendly with their flat floors and doorways. Outdoor environments often present more varied terrain challenges where legs or specialized wheel designs like tracks might be necessary.\n\n5. **Weather and environmental conditions**: Will your robot face rain, mud, snow, or extreme temperatures? These conditions can affect which movement system will work best.\n\nThe best robot designs carefully match the movement method to both the task requirements and the expected operating environment. Sometimes the ideal solution combines multiple approaches!\n\n### **Common Applications and Best Practices**\n\nHere are some typical robot applications and the movement methods commonly used for each:\n\n**Warehouse robots** typically use wheels, especially omnidirectional ones, to navigate the flat, well-maintained floors while carrying inventory. Amazon's warehouse robots use Mecanum wheels to slide sideways between shelving units without needing to turn in tight spaces.\n\n**Search and rescue robots** often use tracks or legged designs to navigate disaster areas with rubble, debris, and unstable surfaces. The DARPA Robotics Challenge showed how quadrupedal and humanoid robots could navigate complex disaster scenarios including climbing ladders and crossing uneven terrain.\n\n**Home robots** like vacuum cleaners almost exclusively use wheels because homes generally have flat floors and the robots need to be affordable and energy-efficient. However, they include sensors to detect and avoid obstacles or stairs they cannot handle.\n\n**Agricultural robots** might use large wheels or tracks to navigate fields without damaging crops, providing stability on soft soil while carrying equipment for planting, monitoring, or harvesting.\n\n**Space exploration rovers** like those on Mars use specialized wheel designs that can handle rocky terrain while minimizing the chance of getting stuck, since there's no one there to rescue them!\n\nThe right movement method depends on matching your robot's capabilities to its mission requirements. Sometimes a simple wheeled design is perfect, while other situations demand the adaptability of legs or specialized locomotion systems.\n\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robots need different movement methods based on their tasks - consider speed, weight capacity, battery life, and precision requirements when choosing.\n- The environment determines whether wheels or legs work better - smooth surfaces favor wheels, while uneven terrain and obstacles often require legs.\n- Different robot jobs need specific movement types - warehouse robots use omnidirectional wheels for flat floors, while search and rescue robots need tracks or legs to handle rough terrain.\n---keytakeawaysEND---",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
