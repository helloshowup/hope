When we know exactly what problem we're trying to solve, we can create solutions that really work!\n\nLet's look at two different problem statements:\n- Poor: \"We need a robot that does stuff in the classroom.\"\n- Good: \"We need a robot that can safely move around desks and chairs to deliver materials to student groups, and it needs to run for at least 2 hours without needing to recharge.\"\n\nCan you spot the difference? The first one is super vague - what \"stuff\" should the robot do? The second one tells us exactly what the robot needs to do, where it will work, and how long its battery should last.\n\nThink of it like giving directions to a friend. \"Go somewhere fun\" isn't helpful, but \"Go three blocks north to the ice cream shop with the blue sign\" gives them a clear destination!\n\nWell-defined problems help us save time, feel less frustrated, and build robots that actually work. In this lesson, we'll learn how to write these clear problem statements and use them to guide our robot building.\n\nBefore we can build a robot to solve a problem, we need to understand exactly what that problem is. It's like trying to pack for a trip without knowing where you're going or what the weather will be like! The same idea applies to robotics - we need a clear picture of the problem before we can design a good solution.\n\nIn robotics, a well-defined problem helps us figure out what sensors our robot might need (like distance sensors or light sensors), what actions it should perform (like moving objects or following lines), and how we'll know if it's successful. Without this clarity, we might build something cool that doesn't actually solve the real problem!\n\nIn robotics, a well-defined problem helps us determine what sensors our robot might need, what actions it should perform, and what success looks like. Without this clarity, we might build something that doesn't actually solve the real issue or misses important requirements.\n\nA strong problem statement is like a roadmap for your robotics project. It should include these important parts:\n\n1. **Clear description of the issue** - What's the actual problem? For example: \"Students with mobility challenges cannot reach books on the top shelves in our library.\"\n\n2. **Define the boundaries** - What will your solution do and not do? For example: \"Our robot will help get books down from shelves, but won't put them back or check them out.\"\n\n3. **Success measures** - How will you know if your solution works? For example: \"The robot should get a requested book within 2 minutes and deliver it safely to the student.\"\n\nWhen you put all these parts together, you create a clear target for your robot design. It's like having a detailed treasure map instead of just being told \"there's treasure somewhere on the island\"!\n\nWhen these elements come together, they create a clear target for your design efforts and help everyone understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish.\n\nHere's a simple fill-in-the-blank template you can use to create your own problem statements:\n\n\"The problem is that [describe the issue] affecting [who is affected]. A successful solution would [measurable outcome] while [important constraints].\"\n\nLet's try an example:\n\"The problem is that students waste time walking to the recycling bins during class, affecting learning time. A successful solution would reduce classroom interruptions by 50% while keeping recycling properly sorted.\"\n\nTry creating your own problem statement using this template! Think about an issue in your school or home that a robot might help solve.\n\nThis template helps you organize your thoughts and ensures you cover all the important parts of a good problem statement.\n",
  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational lesson on defining problems and researching solutions for robotics projects. It covers the importance of crafting clear and specific problem statements to guide the design process. The lesson uses examples to illustrate the differences between vague and well-defined problems, and provides a template for creating effective problem statements.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content - teaching students how to define problems for robotics projects.\n2. Address the specific needs outlined in the enhancement prompt, including:\n   - Generating content to fill in the instruction blocks marked with %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n   - Ensuring the generated content seamlessly integrates with the surrounding text\n   - Preserving all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, ---keytakeaways---) intact\n3. Optimize the content for the target learner profile and learning medium.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: English-speaking students\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nBased on the learner profile, the content should:\n- Use everyday language and sentence structure familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit technical jargon and define necessary terms immediately\n- Break information into clear, concise paragraphs with frequent headings and visual breaks\n- Incorporate relevant images, diagrams, and examples to support understanding\n- Adopt a conversational, friendly tone to engage the middle school audience\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained and optimized for independent learning, without relying on external resources or live instruction.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose of teaching students how to define clear problem statements for robotics projects\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after any generated content\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns (headings, bullet points, etc.)\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully analyze each instruction block to understand the requested content and its role within the overall document.\n2. Generate content that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding text, using the target learner profile and learning medium considerations to guide the writing style, language, and formatting.\n3. Ensure the generated content preserves the educational integrity and core purpose of the lesson, while addressing the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt.\n4. Review the final document to verify that all special marker tags are preserved and the content reads as a cohesive whole, with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process.",
