  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on exploring a variety of fitness activities for middle school students. It covers different types of individual, partner, team, adventure, and mindful movement activities, with instructions for trying sample exercises. The content aims to help students identify enjoyable physical activities they can do at home and create a simple weekly fitness plan.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain all original section headings exactly as written\n   - Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n\n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all group activities to individual activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n\n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: English-speaking students\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical Space/Equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed from a classroom-based format to asynchronous online learning. All group activities, teacher-led elements, and timed components must be adapted for independent, self-paced completion in a home environment.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Preserve the original content's educational integrity and core value\n- Adapt activities and instructions for effective independent learning\n- Ensure content is accessible and engaging for the target middle school audience\n- Optimize for asynchronous online delivery with clear visuals and structured guidance\n\n# Suggested Approach\n1. Maintain all original section headings, sequence, and numbering to preserve structural integrity.\n2. Convert group activities to individual exercises with self-guided instructions.\n3. Adapt references to classroom spaces and equipment to options available in a home environment.\n4. Replace timed components with self-paced elements.\n5. Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs with self-evaluation mechanisms.\n6. Ensure language, examples, and complexity are appropriate for 5th-6th grade reading level.\n7. Incorporate visual elements like images, diagrams, and illustrations to support learning.\n8. Create clear, step-by-step instructions with frequent headings and visual breaks.\n9. Provide safety guidelines, equipment alternatives, and space adaptations for each activity.\n10. Maintain a friendly, conversational tone to engage the middle school audience.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
