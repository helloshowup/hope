They're probably using something called the FITT Principle. It's a straightforward way to plan workouts that actually work for YOU - not just what someone else thinks you should do.\n\n## What is the FITT Principle?\n\nThe FITT Principle breaks down exercise planning into four key parts:\n\n- **F**requency: How often you exercise (like 3 times a week)\n- **I**ntensity: How hard you work during exercise (easy, medium, or challenging)\n- **T**ime: How long each workout lasts (20 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.)\n- **T**ype: What kind of exercise you do (running, dancing, basketball, etc.)\n\nThese four elements work together like ingredients in your favourite recipe. Just as you might add more spice or less sugar to suit your taste, you can adjust these four parts to create exercise that fits your body and goals!\n\n## Exploring Each Part of FITT\n\n### Frequency\nFrequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:\n- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week\n- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover\n- You don't have to do the same thing every day\n- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting\n\n**Example:** You might play basketball on Monday and Wednesday, go for a bike ride on Friday, and take a walk around your neighborhood on Saturday.\n\n### Intensity\nIntensity means how hard your body is working. Here are some easy ways to gauge it:\n\n- **Talk Test**: If you can talk but not sing during your activity, that's medium intensity. If you can barely talk, that's high intensity.\n- **Scale of Effort**: On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is sitting still and 10 is running as fast as possible:\n  - 4-5 = medium intensity (you're working but can keep going)\n  - 7-8 = high intensity (challenging but not impossible)\n\n**Example:** When riding your bike, going up a hill might be a 7 (high), while cruising on flat ground might be a 4 (medium).\n\n### Time\nTime refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:\n- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day\n- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too\n- Shorter, more intense workouts can be just as good as longer, easier ones\n- As you get fitter, you can gradually increase your time\n\n**Example:** You might do a 15-minute workout video in the morning and play outside for 20 minutes in the afternoon.\n\n### Type\nType is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types, and a well-rounded fitness plan includes all of them:\n\n1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping\n   - Running, swimming, dancing, biking, jumping rope\n   - Strengthens your heart and lungs\n\n2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle\n   - Push-ups, squats, climbing, resistance bands\n   - Builds stronger muscles and bones\n\n3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles\n   - Yoga, stretching, martial arts\n   - Helps prevent injuries and keeps you moving well\n\n**Example:** In one week, you might jog around your yard (cardio), do a bodyweight workout (strength), and try some yoga (flexibility).\n\n## Creating Your Own FITT Plan\n\nReady to create your own FITT plan? Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set a goal**: What do you want to achieve? Maybe you want to:\n   - Get better at a specific sport\n   - Have more energy throughout the day\n   - Be able to run a mile without stopping\n   - Just have fun being active!\n\n2. **Choose your FITT components**:\n   - **Frequency**: How many days can you realistically exercise?\n   - **Intensity**: What level feels challenging but doable for you?\n   - **Time**: How long can you exercise in one session?\n   - **Type**: What activities do you enjoy most?\n\n3. **Create a weekly schedule**: Plan which days and times you'll exercise\n\n4. **Track your progress**: Keep a simple journal of what you do and how it feels\n\nRemember, the best exercise plan is one that you'll actually do! Choose activities you enjoy and start where you are - you can always adjust as you go.\n\n## Sample FITT Plans for Students\n\nHere are some example FITT plans to help you get started:\n\n**For Beginners:**\n- **Frequency**: 3 days per week\n- **Intensity**: Medium (4-5 out of 10)\n- **Time**: 20-30 minutes per session\n- **Type**: Walking, dancing to favourite music, following along with online exercise videos\n\n**For Sports Performance:**\n- **Frequency**: 4-5 days per week\n- **Intensity**: Mix of medium and high\n- **Time**: 30-45 minutes per session\n- **Type**: Sport-specific practice, interval training, strength exercises you can do at home\n\n**For Overall Fitness:**\n- **Frequency**: 5 days per week\n- **Intensity**: Varied (some easy days, some challenging days)\n- **Time**: 30-60 minutes per session\n- **Type**: Mix of cardio (jogging, jumping jacks), strength (bodyweight exercises), and flexibility (stretching)\n\n## Adjusting Your FITT Plan\n\nAs you follow your plan, you'll learn what works for you and what doesn't. Don't be afraid to make changes! Here's how:\n\n- If it feels too easy: Increase one component at a time (maybe add 5 minutes or try a more challenging activity)\n- If it feels too hard: Decrease one component (maybe reduce the intensity or time)\n- If you get bored: Try a new type of activity while keeping the other components the same\n- If you're not seeing results: Be patient! Results take time, but you might need to increase your intensity\n\nThe most important thing is to listen to your body and make exercise work for YOU.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe FITT Principle gives you the power to create your own personalised fitness plan. By understanding and adjusting the Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of your workouts, you can design an exercise routine that fits your schedule, matches your interests, and helps you reach your goals. Fitness isn't about being perfect - it's about discovering what your amazing body can do!\n\n## Over to You\n\nTake a moment to reflect on these questions:\n1. Which type of exercise do you enjoy the most? Think about how you could add more of this activity into your weekly routine.\n2. Consider one small change you could make to your current activity level using the FITT Principle. Maybe you could add one more day of activity or try a new type of exercise.\n3. How might your FITT plan need to change during different seasons or school breaks? For example, you might do more indoor activities during rainy weather.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- **Cardio**: Activities that make your heart beat faster and can be done for longer periods\n- **Resistance training**: Activities that make your muscles work against a force or weight\n- **Flexibility**: The ability of your muscles and joints to move through their full range of motion\n- **Recovery**: The time between workouts when your body repairs and strengthens itself",
