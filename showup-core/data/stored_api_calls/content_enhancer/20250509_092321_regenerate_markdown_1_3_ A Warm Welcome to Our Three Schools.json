How do you plan to take advantage of Excel High School's commitment to that area?\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content.

  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an introductory message from the President of Excel High School, a fully online, asynchronous secondary education program. The message outlines the school's core promises to students around academic excellence, innovation, and student well-being. It also provides information about the school's accreditation, leadership team, and encourages students to engage with the administration.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Maintain the core purpose and tone of the President's message while enhancing the content to better address the needs of the target learner profile.\n2. Ensure the content is appropriately adapted in terms of language, examples, and complexity to match the reading level and learning preferences of the 6th-12th grade students.\n3. Optimize the content for the asynchronous, self-paced online learning environment, incorporating more visual and interactive elements to engage the learners.\n4. Preserve the key promises and information about the school's leadership and accreditation, while potentially adding or rearranging content to improve flow and impact.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target learners are middle and high school students (ages 11-18) enrolled in the asynchronous online program at Excel High School.\n- Students have varying levels of academic preparedness, with some advanced and college-bound, while others are catching up on credits or exploring alternative education pathways.\n- Many students require flexibility due to balancing academics with other commitments like work, family, or social/emotional needs.\n- Students have diverse cultural backgrounds and varying levels of digital literacy, so the content must be inclusive and accommodate different learning preferences and technology access.\n- Younger students (grades 6-8) may need more parental involvement and support to stay on track, while older students are expected to be more self-directed.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\n- As an asynchronous online program, the content must be designed for independent, self-paced learning without daily external supervision.\n- The content should be broken into manageable chunks, with explicit instructions, active language, and clear objectives to support student self-management.\n- Incorporate more visual aids, interactive elements, and storytelling to maintain engagement in the absence of in-person instruction.\n- Ensure the content can be accessed and completed in a variety of physical learning spaces with limited materials.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose and tone of the President's message, maintaining a professional yet approachable voice.\n- Ensure the content reflects the school's commitment to academic excellence, innovation, and student well-being.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to match the reading level and learning preferences of the 6th-12th grade students.\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online environment, incorporating more visual, interactive, and engaging elements.\n- Maintain the information about the school's accreditation and leadership team, potentially rearranging or adding content to improve flow and impact.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify the key themes, concepts, and structure.\n2. Extract the specific requirements from the enhancement prompt, focusing on maintaining educational integrity, addressing learner needs, preserving original value, and optimizing for the online learning medium.\n3. Analyze the target learner profile, paying close attention to the academic diversity, skill levels, self-management needs, and technology access considerations.\n4. Adapt the language, examples, and complexity of the content to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level for younger students, progressively increasing in difficulty for high school learners.\n5. Incorporate more visual aids, interactive elements, and storytelling to engage students and support their independent, self-paced learning.\n6. Preserve the core promises and information about the school's accreditation and leadership, potentially rearranging or adding content to improve flow and impact.\n7. Ensure the final content is cohesive, with a professional yet approachable tone that reflects the school's commitment to academic excellence, innovation, and student well-being.",
