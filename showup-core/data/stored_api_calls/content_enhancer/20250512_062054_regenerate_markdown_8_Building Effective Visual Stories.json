  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures.

Building on what we've covered about visual hierarchy across platforms, let's explore how to craft cohesive brand narratives that stay true to their core while adapting to different environments.\n\nAs you prepare for your professional careers in graphic design, you'll need to develop this valuable skill: maintaining brand consistency while respecting each medium's unique characteristics. Being able to adapt visual stories across platforms will strengthen your professional portfolio and help you stand out when applying for industry positions.\n\n## The Narrative Triangle: Platform, Audience, and Brand Identity\n\nWhen crafting effective cross-platform narratives, designers must navigate a complex interplay of factors that influence how stories are told and received. Think of this as a balancing act—one where understanding the relationship between medium, message, and recipient becomes crucial to successful communication. This relationship forms what we call the Narrative Triangle.\n\nThe strength of this approach lies in its recognition that brand storytelling isn't one-dimensional. Rather than forcing identical content across all channels, the Narrative Triangle encourages thoughtful adaptation that respects both the brand's core identity and the unique context in which it appears. Let's examine each corner of this triangle in detail:\n\n1. **Platform Characteristics**: Each platform has unique technical constraints, user behaviours, and content consumption patterns\n2. **Audience Expectations**: Users approach different platforms with distinct mindsets and engagement intentions\n3. **Core Brand Identity**: The fundamental brand values, personality, and messaging that must remain consistent\n\nWhen these three elements work in harmony, the result is a cohesive yet adaptable brand narrative that resonates across touchpoints while maintaining its distinctive character.\n\n## Strategic Adaptation: The Three-Platform Approach\n\nTranslating brand narratives across platforms requires more than simply resizing assets or truncating copy. It demands a strategic framework that guides how stories evolve while maintaining their essential character. The Three-Platform Approach offers a practical methodology for designers facing this challenge.\n\nThis approach recognizes that not all platforms serve the same purpose in your brand ecosystem. By categorizing platforms into primary, secondary, and tertiary roles, you can make intentional decisions about how your narrative should adapt while ensuring coherence across the entire brand experience. Let's explore how this strategic framework functions in practice:\n\n### 1. Core Narrative Identification\nBefore adapting content across platforms, identify your brand's key story elements:\n* Central brand promise or value proposition\n* Key visual signifiers (colours, typography, imagery style)\n* Tone of voice and personality markers\n* Primary emotional response you aim to evoke\n\nThese elements must remain consistent regardless of platform to maintain brand recognition.\n\n### 2. Platform-Specific Adaptation\n\n**Primary Platform (Foundation)**\nYour primary platform serves as the narrative home base—the definitive expression of your brand story where users can engage most deeply with your message. This is where you have the most control over the user experience and can craft a comprehensive narrative journey. Think of your primary platform as the director's cut of your brand film, containing all the nuance and detail that might be condensed elsewhere.\n\n- Establishes the complete brand narrative with all core elements\n- Contains the most comprehensive version of brand messaging\n- Serves as the reference point for all adaptations\n- Example: A brand website with full storytelling capabilities\n\n**Secondary Platform (Extension)**\nSecondary platforms extend your narrative into spaces where users engage differently—often more briefly or with specific intentions that differ from your primary platform. Here, the challenge lies in maintaining narrative coherence while acknowledging different user behaviors and technical constraints. These platforms typically require more selective storytelling that emphasizes certain aspects of your brand narrative while maintaining clear connections to the primary experience.\n\n- Adapts primary narrative to different consumption patterns\n- Emphasises selected narrative elements based on platform strengths\n- Maintains core messaging while adjusting format and pacing\n- Example: Social media channels with more concise, visual storytelling\n\n**Tertiary Platform (Reinforcement)**\nThe most constrained yet often most visible touchpoints in your brand ecosystem are tertiary platforms. These brief encounters with your brand require exceptional clarity and immediate recognition. The design challenge here involves distilling your narrative to its most essential elements while ensuring these moments still feel connected to the broader brand experience. Success on tertiary platforms often comes down to the power of visual shorthand and emotional triggers.\n\n- Distills narrative to its fundamental elements\n- Creates recognition through consistent visual cues\n- Focuses on memory triggers and brand recall\n- Example: Out-of-home advertising (billboards, posters) or brief digital touchpoints\n\n### 3. Narrative Continuity Techniques\nMaintaining a coherent brand story across diverse platforms requires deliberate techniques that bridge different user experiences. While each platform demands its own approach, certain continuity strategies help create a sense of unified brand presence regardless of where customers encounter your message. These techniques function like narrative threads, weaving together disparate touchpoints into a recognizable whole that reinforces rather than fragments your brand identity.\n\nTo maintain continuity while adapting:\n* Use visual anchors (consistent brand elements) across all platforms\n* Adjust content density based on platform engagement patterns\n* Maintain tonal consistency while adapting message length\n* Create platform-appropriate calls to action that align with the overall narrative\n\nDocument your observations in a brief analysis that identifies specific narrative techniques being employed. This analysis will help you develop critical thinking about cross-platform design decisions—a skill that employers specifically look for in junior designers.\n\n## Looking Ahead: Building Effective Visual Stories\n\nNext, we'll build on these adaptation strategies to develop complete visual storytelling systems. You'll learn to craft measurable criteria for narrative consistency and apply a 10-point framework for narrative development that ensures your brand voice remains consistent regardless of platform.
