This raises important privacy questions. A **delivery drone** flying over your neighborhood might record video of your backyard or see through windows. Even robots on the ground might capture images of people who haven't given permission to be recorded.\n\n**Engineers** and **policymakers** are working on solutions to these concerns. Some robots now include privacy features like automatic blurring of faces or license plates in their recordings. Others have visible lights that show when they're recording, similar to the red light on a video camera. Some communities have created **\"no-fly zones\"** where drones and other aerial robots aren't allowed.\n\nIt's important for robot designers to think about what data their robots really need to collect to do their jobs. A robot delivering packages doesn't necessarily need to record video of its entire journey – it might only need to capture images at the delivery location to prove the package was delivered.\n\nIn many cities, community groups are working with local governments to create rules about where and when robots can operate. For example, in **San Francisco**, delivery robots are limited to certain neighborhoods and must have human operators nearby. These rules help balance the benefits of robot services with people's right to privacy in public spaces. Robot companies are also developing **\"privacy by design\"** approaches, where privacy protections are built into robots from the beginning rather than added later.\n\n### **Safety in Shared Spaces**\n\nWhen robots share spaces with humans, pets, wildlife, and other robots, safety becomes a critical concern. Robots need to move in ways that don't endanger others. This means having reliable sensors to detect obstacles and people, and programming that makes robots behave predictably.\n\nMany robots use a combination of cameras, **ultrasonic sensors** (like bat echolocation), and **lidar** (which uses laser light to measure distances) to create a map of their surroundings. Advanced robots can recognize different types of obstacles – distinguishing between a stationary trash can and a child who might suddenly move.\n\nRobot movement should also be designed to be understandable to humans. People feel more comfortable around robots that signal their intentions, like slowing down before turning or making gentle sounds when approaching. Some delivery robots have screens that display **\"eyes\"** or text messages to communicate with people nearby.\n\nThe integration of **sensors** with **movement systems** is crucial for safety. For example, the delivery robots made by **Starship Technologies** use multiple cameras and sensors to detect people, pets, and obstacles. When the robot's cameras spot someone walking nearby, it immediately adjusts its speed and direction to avoid them. The robot's programming includes special rules for crosswalks, making it wait until it's safe to cross streets. These robots have traveled millions of miles in cities around the world with an excellent safety record because their sensors and movement systems work together seamlessly.\n\n### **Noise and Environmental Impact**\n\nRobots can affect the environment they move through in ways their designers might not expect. Noisy drones might disturb wildlife or annoy people. Underwater robots could accidentally damage fragile coral reefs. Even small robots moving through natural areas might compact soil or disturb small plants and animals.\n\n**Engineers** are developing quieter propellers for aerial robots and gentler movement systems for underwater robots. Some robots are now designed to break down naturally if they're lost in the environment, reducing pollution. Others include special sensors to detect sensitive environments and adjust their movement accordingly.\n\nBefore deploying robots in natural areas, researchers often conduct **environmental impact studies** to understand how robot presence might affect local ecosystems. In some cases, the benefits of using robots (like monitoring endangered species without human disturbance) might outweigh the potential disruptions they cause.\n\nResearchers at the **University of California** have developed new **\"whisper-quiet\"** drone propellers that reduce noise by up to 70% compared to standard designs. These new propellers have special shapes inspired by owl wings, which allow owls to fly silently when hunting. The quieter drones can be used to monitor wildlife without scaring animals away or disturbing people in parks and neighborhoods. This is a great example of how engineers are addressing environmental concerns through innovative design improvements.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot swimming in a coral reef.

Snake-like slithering movement is ideal for narrow pipes as it allows the robot to move through confined spaces, navigate bends, and maintain contact with the pipe surface. The narrow, flexible design mimics how real snakes navigate similar confined spaces. If you chose a different answer, consider how the movement method would handle tight spaces and turns within a pipe environment.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## **Key Takeaways**\n- Robots in public spaces must protect **privacy** by limiting data collection and using features like face blurring in their recordings.\n- Safe robots need reliable **sensors** to detect obstacles and predictable movement patterns that humans can understand.\n- Engineers design robots to minimize **environmental impact** through quieter propellers, biodegradable materials, and sensors that detect sensitive environments.\n---keytakeawaysEND---",
