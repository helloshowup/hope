When we see a robot move, we're witnessing its ability to change its position or the position of its parts to accomplish tasks. Think about it - without movement, many robots would simply be stationary computers!\n\nMovement gives robots the power to interact with the world around them. Whether it's a robot arm assembling a car part, a drone delivering a package, or a robot vacuum cleaning your home, movement is what allows these machines to be useful in our daily lives.\n\nThe ability to move is what transforms a simple computer into a machine that can physically change its environment. This is why movement is considered such a fundamental part of what makes many robots truly robotic.\n\n### **Why Robots Need to Move**\n\nRobots need to move for many different reasons, all connected to their specific jobs or purposes. Here are some of the main reasons:\n\nFirst, robots often need to move to complete **tasks**. A delivery robot must travel from one location to another. A manufacturing robot arm needs to reach, grab, and place objects. Even a simple educational robot like Sphero needs to roll around to draw shapes or navigate mazes.\n\nSecond, movement allows robots to **explore** and gather information about their surroundings. **Mars rovers** like Curiosity and Perseverance move across the Martian surface to study different areas and collect samples. **Robot vacuums** move around your home to find and clean dirty spots.\n\nThird, movement enables robots to **adapt** to changing environments. **Search and rescue robots** need to navigate through disaster areas that may be constantly changing. **Agricultural robots** must move through fields with varying terrain and plant growth.\n\n### **Moving vs. Non-Moving Robots**\n\nNot all robots need to move to be useful. Some robots are designed to stay in one place, while others need mobility to fulfill their purpose.\n\n**Stationary robots** include industrial robot arms that are fixed to a specific spot on a factory floor. These robots can move their arms and tools with incredible precision, but the base of the robot remains in place. Other examples include **automated teller machines (ATMs)**, which process banking transactions without needing to move locations, and some smart home devices like voice assistants.\n\n**Moving robots**, on the other hand, change their location to perform their tasks. Examples include **self-driving cars**, **delivery drones**, **robot vacuums**, and **exploration robots**. Their ability to navigate through space is essential to their function. A delivery robot that couldn't move would be useless for its intended purpose!\n\nThe choice between a moving or non-moving design depends entirely on what the robot needs to accomplish. A **robot surgeon** needs precise arm movements but doesn't need to travel around the hospital. A **warehouse robot**, however, must be able to travel throughout the facility to retrieve items.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## **Key Takeaways**\n- Robots move to complete **tasks**, explore their surroundings, and adapt to changing environments.\n- Some robots are designed to stay in one place (like factory arms), while others need to move around (like delivery robots) to fulfill their purpose.\n- A robot's movement capabilities directly connect to its job - the right type of movement helps the robot accomplish its specific tasks.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an introduction to robot movement, explaining why robots need to move, the differences between moving and non-moving robots, and how a robot's movement capabilities are tied to its specific tasks and purposes. The content is structured with clear learning objectives, a lesson discussion, and explanations supported by examples.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests five specific formatting changes to be made to the content:\n1. Add bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n2. Ensure proper paragraph breaks with exactly one empty line between paragraphs.\n3. Preserve the logical flow and organization of the content while improving readability.\n4. Do not alter any existing content beyond the specified formatting changes.\n5. Apply all transformations harmoniously without creating conflicts.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nBased on the learner profile, the content should:\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words and write in active voice\n- Break information into clear \"chunks\" with frequent headings and subheadings\n- Include relevant images, diagrams, and visual examples to support understanding\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle school students\n- Use a conversational, friendly tone to engage the audience\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the formatting and structure must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without the ability to clarify concepts in real-time.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content\n- Preserve the original structure, organization, and logical flow\n- Ensure all formatting changes are consistent and do not create conflicts\n- Enhance readability and engagement for the target middle school audience\n- Avoid overly prescriptive changes to the content beyond the requested formatting\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Identify all key terms, headers, and important concept labels throughout the content.\n2. Apply bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`.\n3. Ensure proper paragraph breaks by adding exactly one empty line between paragraphs.\n4. Review the content to verify the logical flow and organization remain intact.\n5. Check that no other content has been altered beyond the specified formatting changes.\n6. Validate that all transformations work harmoniously without creating conflicts or issues.\n7. Confirm the enhanced content aligns with the target learner's needs and the limitations of the asynchronous online delivery medium.\n\nThe goal is to improve the readability and engagement of the content for the middle school audience while preserving the original educational value and structure. Focus on surgical, minimally invasive formatting changes that enhance the learning experience without fundamentally altering the content.",
