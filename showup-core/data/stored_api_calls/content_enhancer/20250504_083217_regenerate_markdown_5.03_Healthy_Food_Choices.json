When you're running around in PE, playing sports or just having fun with friends, the food you eat before and after makes a real difference to your performance and how you feel. Good nutrition can give you more energy, help build stronger muscles, and keep you going during all your activities.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model shows how to build a balanced meal using a simple plate diagram. Your plate should include:\n- **Fruits**: These colourful foods provide quick energy and vitamins (apples, bananas, berries)\n- **Vegetables**: Packed with vitamins and minerals to support your health (carrots, broccoli, spinach)\n- **Grains**: These provide lasting energy for your activities (bread, pasta, rice - whole grain versions are best)\n- **Protein**: These foods help build and repair your muscles (chicken, beans, eggs, nuts)\n- **Dairy**: Great for building strong bones (milk, yogurt, cheese)\n\nIncluding foods from each group in your meals will help keep your body properly fuelled.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nA small snack about 30-60 minutes before exercise gives your body the energy it needs to perform well. Some good pre-workout snack ideas include:\n\n- **Banana with a spoonful of peanut butter**: The banana provides quick energy while the peanut butter helps that energy last longer\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: A tasty mix of quick energy and protein\n- **Yogurt with berries**: Easy to digest and full of nutrients\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These provide steady energy that won't disappear too quickly\n\nRemember: Keep your pre-workout snack light - just enough to fuel your activity without making you feel sluggish.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nAfter being active, your body needs to recover and repair. Eating when you finish exercising helps your muscles rebuild and grow stronger. Good post-workout foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: It's not just a treat - chocolate milk has a good balance of carbs and protein to help your body recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The protein helps repair muscles, while the wrap provides needed carbohydrates\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Quick to make and packed with nutrients\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: A flavourful combination that provides protein and carbs\n\nDon't forget to drink water after exercise! Replacing the fluids lost through sweat is a key part of recovery.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels tell you what's actually in the food you're eating. Here's what to look for:\n\n- **Serving size**: How much food counts as one serving\n- **Calories**: The amount of energy the food provides\n- **Protein**: Foods with good protein content help your muscles\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - whole grains and natural sugars are better choices than added sugars\n- **Sugars**: Try to limit foods with lots of added sugars\n- **Ingredients list**: Shorter lists with recognisable ingredients usually mean less processed foods\n\n## Over to You\nTake a look in your kitchen and find two similar snacks. Read their labels and compare them. Which one would be better before exercise? Which would be better after? Write down your reasons in a notebook. You can also try keeping a food diary for a day - draw a plate for each meal and see how your food choices match up with the MyPlate model. This will help you see if you're getting a good balance of different food groups.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhat you eat before and after physical activity significantly impacts your performance and recovery. Using the MyPlate model, choosing appropriate pre- and post-workout snacks, and understanding food labels will help you make smart choices. With the right nutrition, you'll have more energy, build stronger muscles, and feel your best during all your activities!",

Prioritize natural, varied expression over formulaic patterns\n\nThis refinement creates more authentic, engaging educational content while maintaining perfect structural and educational integrity.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational piece on fueling the body for physical activity. It covers the MyPlate model for balanced nutrition, recommendations for pre-workout and post-workout snacks, and guidance on reading food labels. The overall purpose is to help learners understand how proper nutrition can support their physical performance and recovery.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\n1. STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain all original section headings exactly as written\n   - Preserve all educational substance and learning objectives\n   - Maintain the overall document structure and organization\n\n2. PATTERN ELIMINATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks\n   - Substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions\n   - Convert formulaic transitions to natural connections\n   - Replace artificial excitement markers with inherently interesting content\n   - Eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clichés \n\n3. AUTHENTIC VOICE ENHANCEMENT (SUPPORTING):\n   - Vary sentence structure and length throughout\n   - Replace generic explanations with specific examples\n   - Add natural language variations and conversational elements\n   - Create authentic progression between ideas\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds, keep sentences to 15-20 words, and write in active voice and present tense. Jargon should be avoided or defined immediately. The structure should use frequent headings, short paragraphs, and visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations.\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. The formatting and structure should be optimized for self-paced, independent learning on a digital platform.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core educational substance and learning objectives\n- Eliminate predictable patterns, generic language, and artificial enthusiasm\n- Enhance authenticity through varied sentence structure, natural transitions, and specific examples\n- Ensure readability, engagement, and accessibility for the target 11-14 year old learners\n\n# Suggested Approach\nFocus the enhancement on refining the language and voice to create a more authentic, engaging learning experience while strictly maintaining the original content's structure and educational integrity. Replace formulaic comparisons, overused intensifiers, and artificial enthusiasm with natural, varied expression. Provide specific examples and relatable connections to make the concepts more accessible for the middle school audience. Optimize the formatting and visual elements for the asynchronous online delivery, ensuring the content is easy to navigate and understand independently.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",

The foods you eat before playing basketball, running in PE class, or riding bikes with friends affect both how well you perform and how you feel afterward. Eating the right foods at the right times gives you energy to play longer, helps build stronger muscles, and speeds up how quickly you recover.\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model uses a simple plate diagram to show what balanced meals look like. A healthy plate includes:\n- **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and berries provide quick energy and important vitamins\n- **Vegetables**: Carrots, broccoli, and spinach contain minerals and vitamins that keep your body working properly\n- **Grains**: Bread, pasta, and rice fuel your activities with long-lasting energy (brown and whole grain versions work best)\n- **Protein**: Chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts help repair and build your muscles\n- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain calcium that strengthens your bones\n\nWhen you include foods from each group in your meals, your body gets all the nutrients it needs.\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nEating a small snack 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body fuel to perform well. Try these pre-workout snacks:\n\n- **Banana with peanut butter**: Bananas provide quick energy while peanut butter adds protein that helps that energy last\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: The fruit gives immediate energy while cheese adds staying power\n- **Yogurt with berries**: This combination digests easily and provides both quick and sustained energy\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These complex carbohydrates release energy steadily during your activity\n\nKeep your pre-workout snack small - just enough to fuel you without feeling heavy in your stomach.\n\n## Post-Workout Refuelling\nYour body needs specific nutrients after exercise to recover properly. Eating within 30 minutes after finishing activity helps your muscles rebuild stronger. Good recovery foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: This tasty drink contains an excellent ratio of carbohydrates to protein that helps muscles recover\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The lean meat repairs muscle tissue while the wrap replenishes energy stores\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Blending these ingredients creates an easy-to-digest mix of proteins and carbs\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: This Middle Eastern combo provides plant protein and energy-restoring carbohydrates\n\nDrink plenty of water after sweating! Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels reveal what's actually in the products you buy. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)\n- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body\n- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair\n- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones\n- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources\n- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed\n\n## Over to You\nFind two similar snacks in your kitchen. Compare their labels side by side. Which would work better before playing sports? Which seems better for after? Write down your reasoning. You might also track your food for a day by drawing a plate for each meal and marking which food groups you included. This visual record shows whether you're getting a good balance according to the MyPlate model.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe foods you choose before and after being active directly affect your energy levels, strength, and recovery.
