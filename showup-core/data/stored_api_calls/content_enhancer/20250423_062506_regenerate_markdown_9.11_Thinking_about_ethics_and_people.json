Understanding who these people are and what they need helps us make better design choices.\n\n### Identifying Who Is Affected\n**Stakeholders** are all the people who might interact with or be affected by a robot. They include:\n\n- **Direct users**: People who will operate or work directly with the robot\n- **Indirect users**: People who benefit from the robot's work but don't control it\n- **Bystanders**: People who might encounter the robot but aren't using it\n- **Maintenance workers**: People who repair and maintain the robot\n- **Businesses or organizations**: Groups that own or sell the robot\n- **Community members**: People living where the robot operates\n\nFor example, a hospital delivery robot's stakeholders include nurses who program it, patients who receive medications from it, visitors who pass it in hallways, technicians who fix it, the hospital administration that purchased it, and even janitorial staff who clean around it.\n\nMaking a complete list of stakeholders is the first step in ethical robot design. This helps make sure we don't accidentally ignore important groups of people.\n\n### Understanding Different Needs\nDifferent stakeholders often have very different needs and concerns about robots. What works well for one group might create problems for another.\n\nFor example, with a school security robot:\n- School administrators might want constant monitoring and facial recognition\n- Students might be concerned about privacy and feeling watched\n- Parents might want safety but worry about data collection\n- Maintenance staff need the robot to be easy to repair\n- Visitors need clear information about where the robot is and what it does\n\nGood robot designers take time to talk with different stakeholders and understand their unique perspectives. They might use surveys, interviews, or focus groups to learn what each group needs and values.\n\n**Stakeholder engagement example:** When designing a robot to help in school libraries, one company invited students, teachers, librarians, and school administrators to participate in design workshops. They used simple activities like drawing their \"dream library robot\" and sorting feature cards by importance. The company discovered that while librarians wanted help shelving books, students most wanted help finding books on topics they were interested in. This led to a robot design with both shelving capabilities and an interactive screen where students could search for book recommendations.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a robot designed for use in schools. Who are all the different people who might interact with or be affected by this robot? Consider how the needs of students, teachers, administrators, custodial staff, and parents might differ.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n### Resolving Conflicting Interests\nSometimes different stakeholders want things that conflict with each other. For example, users might want a robot that works very quickly, while bystanders want one that moves slowly for safety.\n\nWhen interests conflict, robot designers can use several strategies:\n\n1. **Find creative compromises**: Design features that meet multiple needs at once. For example, a robot could move quickly in empty areas but slow down when people are nearby.\n\n2. **Prioritize based on values**: Decide which values matter most, like safety, efficiency, or accessibility. This helps determine which needs should come first.\n\n3. **Include adjustable settings**: Create robots that can be customized for different situations or users.\n\n4. **Involve stakeholders in decisions**: Bring different groups together to discuss trade-offs and find solutions everyone can accept.\n\nFor example, when designing a restaurant serving robot, designers might prioritize food safety first, then create adjustable speed settings that restaurant managers can change during busy or quiet times.\n\n\n# Inclusive and Accessible Design\n\nCreating robots that everyone can use, regardless of their abilities or background, is both ethical and practical. **Inclusive design** makes robots more useful for all people.\n\n### Designing for Different Abilities\nPeople have different physical and cognitive abilities. Some people have limited vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive processing. Good robot design takes these differences into account.\n\nFor example, a robot might include:\n- Voice commands for people who can't use touch screens\n- Visual signals for people who can't hear audio alerts\n- Simple, clear instructions for people with cognitive disabilities\n- Physical designs that don't require fine motor control\n- Height adjustments for people in wheelchairs or of different statures\n\nThe best approach is called \"**universal design**\" - creating robots that work well for as many people as possible without needing special adaptations. For instance, a robot with both voice and screen interfaces works for people who can see, people who can hear, and people who can do both.\n\n**Real-world example:** Robots that help people with disabilities show how inclusive design works in practice. One robot designed to help people with mobility impairments was created with adjustable height controls, multiple ways to give commands (voice, touch screen, and physical buttons), and simple, clear instructions with pictures. The designers tested the robot with people who use wheelchairs, people with limited hand strength, and people with different cognitive abilities to make sure everyone could use it successfully.\n\n### Cultural and Social Inclusivity\nRobots should work well for people from all cultural backgrounds and social situations. This means considering differences in:\n\n- Languages spoken\n- Cultural gestures and customs\n- Economic resources\n- Technical experience and comfort with technology\n- Living environments (urban, rural, etc.)\n\nFor example, a robot designed for international use should speak multiple languages and avoid gestures that might be offensive in some cultures. A robot for public spaces should be usable by people with limited technology experience and not require expensive smartphones to interact with it.\n\nInclusive design also means considering how robots might affect different communities. Will the robot be affordable for schools in all neighborhoods? Does it require high-speed internet that some areas don't have?\n\n**Global perspectives:** Attitudes toward robots vary greatly around the world. In Japan, robots are often welcomed as helpers and even companions. In some parts of Europe, people may be more concerned about robots replacing jobs. In many African countries, there's growing interest in how robots can help with healthcare and education where there aren't enough human workers. In some indigenous communities, there are important questions about how robots might affect traditional ways of life and cultural practices. Good robot designers learn about these different perspectives and create robots that respect local values and needs.\n\n### Testing with Diverse Users\nThe best way to ensure robots work for everyone is to test them with diverse groups of users. This means including people of different:\n\n- Ages\n- Abilities\n- Cultural backgrounds\n- Technology experience levels\n- Genders\n\nWhen testing, designers should observe how different people interact with the robot and listen to their feedback. Often, users will identify problems that designers never considered.\n\nFor example, a company designing a robot museum guide might test it with elderly visitors, children, international tourists, and people with various disabilities. Each group will provide valuable insights about how to improve the robot's design.\n\nTesting should happen early and often throughout the design process, not just at the end. This way, problems can be fixed before the robot is finalized.\n\n## Activity 2: Inclusive Design Challenge\nSelect an existing robot design (e.g., a customer service robot or educational robot) and modify it to make it more accessible for users with a specific disability. Consider what features you would add or change to ensure the robot could be effectively used by someone with a visual, hearing, or mobility impairment.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Have you ever encountered a technology that was difficult for you to use? Reflect on how it could have been better designed to meet your needs and consider how this experience might inform your approach to inclusive robot design.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhen designing a robot for a public library, which approach best demonstrates ethical decision-making?\n\nA. Designing the robot to be as technologically advanced as possible\n\nB. Making the robot look exactly like a human librarian\n\nC. Ensuring the robot can complete tasks as quickly as possible\n\nD. Considering the needs of users with different abilities, ages, and technological comfort levels\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is D. Considering the needs of users with different abilities, ages, and technological comfort levels. Ethical decision-making in robot design involves considering the diverse needs of all potential users. A library serves people of varying ages, abilities, and comfort with technology, so the robot should be designed to be accessible and usable by everyone who might encounter it. If you chose a different answer, remember that technological advancement, human-like appearance, or speed are not necessarily ethical priorities if they don't serve the needs of diverse users.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n\n",

This helps us make better robots that work well for everyone.\n\n### People Affected by Robots\nDifferent people will interact with robots in different ways:\n\n- **Users**: People who will directly use or work with the robot\n- **Bystanders**: People who might be near the robot but aren't using it\n- **Helpers**: People who fix or clean the robot\n- **Organizations**: Schools, hospitals, or companies that own the robot\n- **Community members**: People living in areas where robots operate\n\nFor example, a school hallway robot might affect students, teachers, janitors, visitors, and the school principal - all in different ways!\n\nMaking sure we think about everyone who might encounter a robot is an important first step in creating robots that are fair and helpful.\n\n### Different People Have Different Needs\nNot everyone wants or needs the same things from a robot. What works well for one person might cause problems for someone else.\n\nFor example, with a classroom helper robot:\n- Teachers might want a robot that helps grade papers\n- Students might want a robot that explains difficult concepts\n- Janitors need the robot to not get in the way during cleaning\n- The principal needs to make sure the robot is safe for everyone\n\nGood robot designers talk to many different people to understand what they need. They might use surveys or group discussions to learn what matters most to each group.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a robot designed to help in a grocery store. Who are three different types of people who might interact with this robot? How might their needs be different from each other?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n### When People Want Different Things\nSometimes different people want things from a robot that don't match up. For example:\n- Students might want a fast-moving robot that can quickly deliver items\n- Teachers might want a slower robot that won't disrupt class\n- Someone using a wheelchair might need the robot to move at a certain height\n\nWhen this happens, robot designers can:\n1. **Find creative solutions**: Maybe the robot moves quickly in empty hallways but slows down in crowded areas\n2. **Focus on what's most important**: Safety usually comes before speed or convenience\n3. **Make adjustable robots**: Create robots that can be set up differently for different situations\n\n# Making Robots for Everyone\n\nIt's important to create robots that everyone can use, no matter their abilities or background. This is called **inclusive design**.\n\n### Designing for Different Abilities\nPeople have different abilities when it comes to seeing, hearing, moving, or understanding. Good robot design takes these differences into account.\n\nFor example, a robot might include:\n- Voice commands for people who can't use touch screens\n- Lights or screen messages for people who can't hear beeps\n- Simple, clear instructions with pictures\n- Controls that are easy to reach from different heights\n\nThe best robots work well for as many people as possible without needing special changes. For instance, a robot with both voice commands and buttons works for people who can see, people who can hear, and people who can do both.\n\n### Making Robots Work Across Cultures\nRobots should work well for people from all backgrounds and situations. This means thinking about:\n\n- Different languages people speak\n- Cultural customs and gestures\n- Access to technology\n- Different living environments\n\nFor example, a robot designed for use around the world should speak multiple languages and avoid gestures that might be rude in some cultures. A robot for public spaces should be easy to use even for people who don't have much experience with technology.\n\n### Testing with Many Different People\nThe best way to make sure robots work for everyone is to test them with many different types of people, including:\n\n- Young people and older adults\n- People with different abilities\n- People from different cultural backgrounds\n- People with different levels of technology experience\n\nWhen testing, designers should watch how different people interact with the robot and listen to their feedback. Often, users will point out problems that designers never thought about.\n\n## Activity: Inclusive Robot Design Challenge\nThink about a robot that could help in your school. How would you design it so that EVERYONE could use it easily? Consider what features you would include to make sure the robot works well for someone who:\n- Uses a wheelchair\n- Speaks a different language\n- Has never used a robot before\n- Has trouble seeing or hearing\n\n---stopandreflect---\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Have you ever tried to use something that was difficult for you? Maybe it was too tall, too complicated, or didn't make sense to you?
