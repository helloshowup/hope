You'll practice simple activities that build useful skills for PE class and everyday situations - like before tests or when you feel overwhelmed. These mindfulness skills complement our previous work with game adaptations by adding a new dimension to physical movement.\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Small open space at home (at least 4x4 feet of clear floor space)\n- Comfortable clothing that allows easy movement\n- Optional comfort items: Pillow, blanket, or folded towel to sit on\n- Timer (phone, watch, or online timer)\n- Printed breathing guide or device to view instructions\n- Water bottle\n- Small soft object (stress ball, stuffed animal) for box breathing tracking (optional)\n- Paper and pencil for tracing box breathing pattern (optional)\n- Simple body outline drawing for tension tracking\n- Chair (for seated modifications if needed)\n\n## Setting Up Your Practice Space\n1. Find a quiet area where you won't be disturbed for 15-20 minutes\n2. Clear any tripping hazards from your practice area\n3. Turn off or silence notifications on devices\n4. Have your timer within reach\n5. If possible, dim lights or find natural lighting that feels calming\n\n## Belly Breathing \n---audioinstructions---\n### Audio Instructions: Mastering Belly Breathing Technique\nhttps://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/8-1-1.mp3\n---audioinstructionsEND---\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add a two paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing.

When we're stressed, our breathing often becomes shallow and quick, staying high in our chest. Belly breathing (sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing) is a simple but powerful technique that helps calm your body's stress response by engaging your diaphragm – the dome-shaped muscle below your lungs.\n\nThink of belly breathing like filling a balloon from the bottom up. When you breathe this way, you're using your lungs more fully and sending a signal to your brain that it's safe to relax. Many athletes, musicians, and even public speakers use this technique right before big performances to help them stay calm and focused.\n\n1. Sit or lie down comfortably on a flat surface. If sitting, keep your back straight but not stiff.\n2. Place one hand on your belly just below your ribs and one hand on your chest.\n3. Take a slow breath in through your nose for a count of 3, feeling your belly push your hand out. Your chest should move only slightly.\n4.

Box breathing gets its name from the four equal parts that make up the practice, like the four sides of a square. This balanced breathing pattern is especially helpful when you need to stay calm under pressure, like during a tough game or before giving a class presentation.\n\nThe steady counting in box breathing gives your mind something specific to focus on, which can help quiet racing thoughts. Many students find this technique particularly helpful before tests or when they're feeling overwhelmed with homework. The best part is that you can practice it anywhere – at your desk, on the bus, or even while waiting in line – and no one will even notice you're doing it!\n\n1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back supported.\n2. Draw an imaginary square in front of you with your finger as you breathe:\n\n- Bottom side: Breathe in for 4 counts\n- Right side: Hold your breath for 4 counts\n- Top side: Breathe out for 4 counts\n- Left side: Hold your breath for 4 counts\n3. Complete 5 full \"boxes\" (about 1-2 minutes total).\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n- If holding your breath is difficult: Reduce to 2-count holds\n- If you lose track: Focus just on equal-length breaths without holds\n- If you feel anxious: Open your eyes and focus on a specific object while breathing\n\n## Body Scan \n---audioinstructions---\n### Audio Instructions: Complete Body Scan Relaxation\nhttps://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/8-1-3.mp3\n---audioinstructionsEND---\n\nAfter practicing focused breathing techniques, the body scan is a natural next step that helps you become more aware of how stress affects your body. Many of us carry tension without even realizing it – maybe your shoulders creep up toward your ears during a math test, or your jaw tightens when you're playing a competitive game. The body scan helps you notice these tension spots so you can release them.\n\nThis practice is like being a detective in your own body, searching for clues about where you hold stress. Athletes often use body scans to check in with their muscles before and after practices or games. You might be surprised to discover areas of tension you weren't aware of! The more you practice, the faster you'll be able to notice and release tension throughout your day – whether you're sitting at your desk, standing in line, or getting ready for bed.\n\n1. Lie down on your back on a comfortable surface with arms at your sides.\n2. Close your eyes if comfortable, or maintain a soft gaze at the ceiling.\n3. Begin at your toes: Wiggle them slightly, then deliberately relax them.\n4. Move upward through each body part in this order:\n\n- Feet (tighten by pointing toes, then relax)\n- Calves (tighten by pulling heels toward you, then relax)\n- Thighs (squeeze muscles, then release)\n- Hips and lower back (gently press into the floor, then release)\n- Stomach (tighten abdominal muscles, then release)\n- Chest (take a deep breath, then let go completely)\n- Hands (make fists, then release)\n- Arms (tense biceps and triceps, then release)\n- Shoulders (lift toward ears, then drop down)\n- Neck (gently tilt chin to chest, then release)\n- Face (scrunch all facial muscles, then relax)\n5.

Mindful movement combines the breathing skills you've learned with simple physical actions. This connection between breath and movement is something athletes naturally develop – watch how a basketball player takes a deep breath before a free throw, or how a soccer player finds their rhythm before taking a penalty kick.\n\nWhen we match our breathing with our movements, we create a natural flow that can help us feel more coordinated and focused. Think about how your breathing changes when you run versus when you walk. By practicing mindful movement, you're training your body and mind to work together more effectively. This skill can help you in sports, dance, or even just moving through a crowded hallway between classes with more awareness and control.\n\n1. Stand in your clear space with feet hip-width apart.\n2. Basic breath-movement patterns (practice each 5 times):\n\n- Mountain Breath: Reach arms up overhead while inhaling (4 counts), lower arms while exhaling (4 counts)\n- Side Bend: Inhale arms overhead, exhale and bend to right side, inhale to center, exhale and bend to left\n- Mindful Steps: Take one step forward on inhale, one step back on exhale, focusing on how your foot connects with the ground\n\n**Creating Your Personal Routine:**\n1.
