Unlike the rigid metal robots we've learned about in previous lessons, soft robots use flexible materials that can bend and stretch, similar to rubber.\n\nThese robots have amazing abilities! They can squeeze through tight spaces and then pop back to their original shape - just like an octopus squeezing through a narrow gap. Soft robots can wrap around objects and pick up delicate items without damaging them.\n\nScientists often look to nature for inspiration, studying animals without hard skeletons like octopuses, jellyfish, and worms. Some soft robots move by inflating and deflating air pockets in their bodies, similar to how a worm moves forward.\n\nIn the real world, soft robots are being tested for gentle tasks like picking strawberries without bruising them. These flexible robot hands can sense how ripe a fruit is and adjust their grip accordingly. Researchers are also developing tiny soft robots that might someday deliver medicine inside the human body.\n\n### Swarm Robotics: The Power of Many\n\nSwarm robotics shows us that sometimes many simple robots can do more than one complex robot! This approach uses groups of small, basic robots that work together as a team - inspired by how ants and bees accomplish big tasks through teamwork.\n\nIn a robot swarm, each robot follows basic rules and communicates with nearby robots. There's no single leader, but together they can solve problems efficiently. For example, a swarm of small robots could search a disaster area much faster than one large robot. If one robot stops working, the others continue the mission.\n\nScientists have created swarms of tiny robots that can form different shapes, move objects by pushing together, and explore unknown areas. In warehouses, robot swarms help organize and retrieve items - each robot does a simple job, but together they can handle hundreds of orders every hour.\n\n### Bio-inspired Robots: Learning from Nature\n\nNature has already solved many of the challenges that robot designers face today. Bio-inspired robotics looks at animals and plants for clever design ideas.\n\nSome fascinating examples include robots that hop like kangaroos to move over rough terrain, or robots with whiskers like rats to help them navigate in the dark. You might have seen videos of Spot, a four-legged robot that walks like a dog and can keep its balance even when pushed. Other robots have wings that flap like birds or insects, giving them better control than traditional drones.\n\nBio-inspired robots aren't just copying how animals look - they're using nature's solutions to difficult problems. Some use artificial muscles that contract with electricity, similar to our own muscles. Others have vision systems based on insect eyes, which are excellent at detecting movement.\n\nIn oceans and lakes, fish-inspired robots help scientists monitor water quality and track pollution. These robot fish swim naturally, allowing them to blend in without disturbing marine life. For search and rescue operations, robots inspired by cockroaches can squeeze through tiny spaces in collapsed buildings to find people after disasters.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Which of these emerging technologies most excites you and why? Think about how it might change how we live or work in the future.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Soft robots can bend, stretch, and squeeze through tight spaces, just like animals without hard skeletons, allowing them to perform delicate tasks like picking ripe fruit.\n- Swarm robotics uses many simple robots working together as a team, inspired by how ants and bees accomplish big tasks through cooperation, to efficiently solve problems like searching disaster areas.\n- Bio-inspired robots copy clever design ideas from nature, such as robots that hop like kangaroos or have whiskers like rats, to solve challenges that traditional robots struggle with.\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
