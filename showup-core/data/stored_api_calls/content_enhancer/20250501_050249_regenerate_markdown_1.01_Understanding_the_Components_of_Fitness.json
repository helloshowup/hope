There are five main parts of fitness that work together - each one gives you different physical powers!\n\n## The Five Components of Fitness\nThink of your fitness as having these five important elements:\n\n### Cardiovascular Endurance: Heart & Lung Power\n- **What it is:** Your heart and lungs' ability to work for a long time without getting tired\n- **Why it matters:** Helps you play longer without getting out of breath\n- **Fun activities:** Running, swimming, dancing, biking, playing tag\n- **Quick demo:** Try 30 seconds of jumping jacks and feel your heartbeat\n\n### Muscular Strength: Muscle Power\n- **What it is:** How much force your muscles can produce\n- **Why it matters:** Helps you lift heavy things and perform strong movements\n- **Fun activities:** Push-ups, climbing, resistance bands, carrying grocery bags\n- **Quick demo:** Try a modified wall push-up and feel which muscles work\n\n### Muscular Endurance: Muscle Stamina\n- **What it is:** How long your muscles can work without getting tired\n- **Why it matters:** Helps you maintain good posture and do activities for longer periods\n- **Fun activities:** Plank holds, sit-ups, squats, playing on monkey bars\n- **Quick demo:** Try holding a wall-sit for 15-30 seconds\n\n### Flexibility: Body Bendiness\n- **What it is:** How far your joints can move and how stretchy your muscles are\n- **Why it matters:** Helps prevent injuries and makes everyday movements easier\n- **Fun activities:** Stretching, yoga, dancing, martial arts\n- **Quick demo:** Try a simple seated hamstring stretch (reaching for your toes while sitting)\n\n### Body Composition: Muscle and Fat Balance\n- **What it is:** The balance between muscle, bone, and fat in your body\n- **Why it matters:** Affects your overall health and how efficiently your body works\n- **How to improve it:** Regular physical activity and balanced nutrition\n- **Important note:** All body types are different, and the goal is health, not a specific appearance\n\n## Over to You\n1.

  "instructions": "You are an experienced educational content editor tasked with reviewing and making minor edits to learning material to improve its accessibility for a specific target learner. Your goal is to remove barriers to learning without significantly altering the core content or going overboard with changes. You have to remember that this content is meant to be read so just a bunch of facts right next to each other is not helpful. Also, dont use words like modules when self referencing (like in \"in this module...\" or \"in the step or section\"), instead use plain statements what will be explored without coming across as rude.  \n\nYour task is to make minor edits to the content that will remove barriers to learning for the target learner profile. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Identify potential barriers to learning based on the target learner profile.\n2. Make small, targeted changes to address these barriers. This may include:\n   - Simplifying complex language\n   - Clarifying confusing concepts\n   - Adding brief explanations for unfamiliar terms\n   - Adjusting formatting for better readability and ensuring there isnt \"death by bullet list\"\n   - Removing or modifying culturally insensitive content\n3. Maintain the original structure and core message of the content.\n4. Do not add substantial new information or remove large portions of the existing content.\n5. Ensure that your edits are minimal and focused on improving accessibility rather than rewriting the entire piece.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the five key components of physical fitness: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. It explains what each component is, why it matters, and suggests fun activities to develop those areas. The content is structured with clear learning objectives, explanations, and interactive \"quick demos\" to engage the learner.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks you to make minor edits to the content to improve accessibility for the target learner. Specifically, you should:\n\n1. Identify potential barriers to learning based on the target learner profile.\n2. Make small, targeted changes to address these barriers, such as:\n   - Simplifying complex language\n   - Clarifying confusing concepts\n   - Adding brief explanations for unfamiliar terms\n   - Adjusting formatting for better readability\n   - Removing or modifying culturally insensitive content\n3. Maintain the original structure and core message of the content.\n4. Avoid adding substantial new information or removing large portions of the existing content.\n5. Ensure that your edits are minimal and focused on improving accessibility rather than rewriting the entire piece.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learner is a group of 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) taking a physical education course through an asynchronous online curriculum at Excel Middle School. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Reading level: 5th-6th grade on the Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Limited prior exposure to formal physical education instruction\n- Preference for visual demonstrations, simple explanations, and hands-on activities\n- Varying access to specialized fitness equipment and home spaces\n\nThe content should use everyday language, short sentences, active voice, and clear formatting to accommodate the target learner's reading level and learning style. Explanations should be concise, and instructions should be broken into numbered steps. Visuals like images, diagrams, and illustrations will be crucial for demonstrating exercises and concepts.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online curriculum, with no opportunities for peer interaction. This means the material must be self-contained and easy to navigate without instructor guidance. Formatting, organization, and visual elements will be particularly important to maintain engagement and comprehension in this independent learning environment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core educational value and learning objectives of the original content\n- Simplify complex language and concepts to match the 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Enhance visual elements to support the target learner's preferred learning style\n- Provide alternatives and adaptations for activities based on equipment and space limitations\n- Ensure safety guidelines and warnings are clear and prominent\n\n## Suggested Approach\nFocus on making small, targeted changes to improve readability, comprehension, and accessibility for the 11-14 year old target audience. Avoid extensive rewrites or additions - the goal is to enhance the existing content rather than completely rewrite it.\n\nKey areas to address:\n- Simplify complex terminology and sentence structure\n- Add brief explanations for any unfamiliar fitness-related concepts\n- Incorporate more visual elements like images, diagrams, and illustrations\n- Break up content into shorter, more digestible sections with clear headings\n- Provide alternative activity options using common household items\n- Emphasize safety considerations and offer modifications for different abilities\n\nRemember to maintain the original structure, learning objectives, and core educational value of the content. Your enhancements should make the material more accessible and engaging for the target learner without drastically altering the overall experience.",
