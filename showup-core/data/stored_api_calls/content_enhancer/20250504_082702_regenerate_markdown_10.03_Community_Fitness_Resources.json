  "instructions": "# Educational Content Structure Preservation & Adaptation\n\nTransform classroom-based educational content into asynchronous online learning material while preserving original structural integrity.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a comprehensive analysis by:\n1. Identifying ALL original section headings and their hierarchy\n2. Mapping the content flow and educational progression\n3. Noting all group activities, assessment components, and teacher-led elements\n4. Identifying all location-specific or equipment-dependent activities\n5. Cataloging all timed components or synchronous elements\n\n## TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - EXCEPTION: Remove \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content\n   - Keep identical section sequence and numbering\n   - Preserve all lesson numbers and module references\n   \n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Convert all GROUP activities to INDIVIDUAL activities\n   - Replace all teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom space/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n   \n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Place introduction content directly after Learning Objectives without a heading\n2. Maintain exact section heading text, numbering, and sequence\n3. Transform ONLY the content within each section, never the sections themselves\n4. Adapt activities for effective independent completion\n\nThis transformation preserves structural integrity while enabling effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.",
  "context": "<PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>\n\n# Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on finding physical activity opportunities in one's local community. It covers various options for staying active, including school-based programs, community recreation centers, free/low-cost activities, and online workout resources. The content is structured with clear learning objectives, explanatory sections, interactive \"Over to You\" prompts, and a final \"Try It Yourself\" activity.\n\n# Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n\n1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (CRITICAL): Maintain all original section headings, sequence, and numbering exactly as written, with the exception of removing the \"## Introduction\" heading while preserving its content.\n\n2. CONTENT ADAPTATION (IMPORTANT): \n   - Convert all group activities to individual activities\n   - Replace teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapt classroom/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Convert timed components to self-paced elements\n\n3. ASSESSMENT ADAPTATION (SUPPORTING):\n   - Convert assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs\n   - Adapt peer-feedback elements to self-assessment mechanisms\n\n# Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) with varying exposure to physical education concepts. Key adaptations for this learner profile include:\n\n- Language and Readability: Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level, use everyday words, limit sentence length, write in active voice.\n- Structure and Organization: Use frequent headings, numbered steps, bullet points, and visual breaks to create clear \"chunks\" of information.\n- Visual Elements: Include relevant images, diagrams, labeled illustrations, and visual examples for each new exercise/activity.\n- Engagement Strategies: Connect to real-world examples, use conversational tone, include processing moments, incorporate storytelling, and create achievable challenges.\n- Equipment and Space Considerations: Provide alternatives using common household items, suggest adaptations for small spaces, and offer variations for different surfaces.\n- Safety Guidelines: Provide clear safety warnings, detailed warm-up/cool-down instructions, modified versions for different abilities, and guidance on when to stop an activity.\n\n# Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is being transformed from a classroom-based format to asynchronous online learning. Key considerations include:\n\n- Removing all group activities and teacher-led facilitation in favor of self-guided instructions.\n- Converting timed components to self-paced elements.\n- Adapting assessment sections to brief reinforcement paragraphs and self-assessment mechanisms.\n\n# Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose of the content: Helping students discover physical activity opportunities in their local community.\n- Maintain the original structure and flow, with the exception of the \"Introduction\" heading removal.\n- Ensure the adapted content remains engaging, accessible, and actionable for the target 11-14 year old learners.\n- Optimize the content for effective independent learning in an asynchronous online environment.\n\n# Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the original content to fully understand the core themes, concepts, and educational progression.\n2. Extract the specific requirements from the enhancement prompt, categorizing them by priority (critical, important, supporting).\n3. Analyze the target learner profile and identify the key adaptations needed for language, structure, visuals, engagement, equipment/space, and safety.\n4. Develop a plan to transform the content while preserving the original intent and structure, focusing on:\n   - Converting group activities to individual activities\n   - Replacing teacher-led facilitation with self-guided instructions\n   - Adapting classroom/equipment references to home environment options\n   - Converting timed components to self-paced elements\n   - Transforming assessment sections to reinforcement paragraphs and self-assessment mechanisms\n5. Implement the adaptations thoughtfully, ensuring the enhanced content remains cohesive, accessible, and effective for the target 11-14 year old learners in an asynchronous online environment.\n\n</PREPARATORY_CONTEXT>",
