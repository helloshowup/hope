  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the academic programs, specialized offerings, and student profiles at Excel High School, an accredited asynchronous online learning environment. The material introduces the school's flexible, self-paced approach and highlights key features of the Canvas learning management system used for course delivery.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt calls for the insertion of 1-3 clear, age-appropriate learning objectives after the main title. These objectives must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) for 11-14 year old students (6th grade reading level). The language used should be simple, concrete, and free of academic jargon to ensure comprehension by the target audience.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe learner profile indicates the content is for middle school students (grades 6-8) enrolled in Excel's asynchronous online program. Key adaptations needed include:\n\n- Vocabulary simplicity is the highest priority, with words kept under 8 letters when possible\n- Use of concrete rather than abstract language, with familiar examples to explain concepts\n- Avoidance of multi-syllable academic terms and complex sentence structures\n- Assumption that this may be the student's first exposure to the topic\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for asynchronous online delivery, where students work independently without daily external supervision.

Craft 1-3 SMART learning objectives using simple, concrete language and age-appropriate action verbs that align with the lesson content.\n3. Format the objectives exactly as specified in the enhancement prompt, with proper spacing and formatting.\n4.
