The material introduces the school's flexible, self-paced approach and highlights key features of the Canvas learning management system used for course delivery.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt calls for the insertion of 1-3 clear, age-appropriate learning objectives after the main title. These objectives must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) for 11-14 year old students (6th grade reading level). The language used should be simple, concrete, and free of academic jargon to ensure comprehension by the target audience.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe learner profile indicates the content is for middle school students (grades 6-8) enrolled in Excel's asynchronous online program.

Craft 1-3 SMART learning objectives using simple, concrete language and age-appropriate action verbs that align with the lesson content.\n3. Format the objectives exactly as specified in the enhancement prompt, with proper spacing and formatting.\n4.
