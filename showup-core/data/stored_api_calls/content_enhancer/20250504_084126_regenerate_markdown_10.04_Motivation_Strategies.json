Finding ways to stay motivated now will help you build healthy habits that last a lifetime!\n\n## Think About Your Motivation\n\nWhat physical activities do you enjoy most? How do you feel before, during and after you exercise?\n\nEveryone has days when they don't feel like being active. That's completely normal! The trick is having strategies to help you stay motivated even on tough days.\n\n## Two Types of Motivation\n\nThere are two main ways we get motivated to be active:\n\n**Internal Motivation** - This comes from inside you:\n- You enjoy how the activity feels\n- You feel proud when you improve\n- You like how exercise makes your body feel stronger\n\n**External Motivation** - This comes from outside you:\n- Getting rewards or prizes\n- Having someone praise you\n- Avoiding getting in trouble\n\n![Image: Two side-by-side illustrations showing internal motivation (person smiling while exercising) and external motivation (person receiving a medal)](placeholder-image)\n\nBoth types of motivation help, but internal motivation typically lasts longer. When you truly enjoy an activity, you're more likely to stick with it!\n\n## Building Exercise Habits That Last\n\nThe best way to stay active is to make exercise a regular habit. Here's how:\n\n1. **Start small**\n   - Begin with just 10 minutes of activity\n   - Choose something you actually enjoy\n   - Exercise 2-3 times per week\n\n2. **Gradually do more**\n   - Add 5 minutes to your workout each week\n   - Try new activities as you get stronger\n   - Slowly increase how many days you exercise\n\n3. **Connect exercise to daily routines**\n   - Exercise right after another habit (like after brushing teeth)\n   - Do it at the same time each day\n   - Put your exercise clothes where you'll see them\n\n## Over to You\nTake a moment to create a simple exercise plan for one week. Choose activities you enjoy and can do in your available space at home. Write down which activities you'll do on different days and how long you'll do them for.\n\n![Image: Diagram showing gradual progression from 10 minutes to 30 minutes of activity](placeholder-image)\n\n## Using Support From Others\n\nHaving encouragement makes staying active much easier!\n\n**Ways to get support:**\n- Ask a family member to check in on your progress\n- Share your goals with someone at home\n- Join online exercise groups or challenges appropriate for your age\n- Follow kid-friendly workout videos on your own schedule\n\n**No equipment? No problem!**\n- Use canned food as weights\n- Use a chair for support during exercises\n- Make an obstacle course with pillows and furniture\n- Use a rolled-up sock as a ball\n\n![Image: Child exercising at home using household items](placeholder-image)\n\n## Safety First!\n- Always warm up for 5 minutes before exercising\n- Start with easier versions of exercises\n- Stop if you feel pain (not just muscle tiredness)\n- Drink water before, during and after activity\n- Make sure you have enough space to move safely\n\n## Tracking Your Progress\n\nSeeing your improvement helps you stay motivated!\n\n**Simple ways to track progress:**\n- Keep a calendar and mark days you exercise\n- Write down how long you exercised each day\n- Note how you felt during and after exercise\n- Track how many repetitions you can do\n\n## Over to You\nUse the template below to create your own tracking sheet. You can draw this on paper or create it digitally:\n\n| Day | Activity | Time | How I Felt |\n|-----|----------|------|------------|\n| Monday | | | |\n| Tuesday | | | |\n| Wednesday | | | |\n| Thursday | | | |\n| Friday | | | |\n| Saturday | | | |\n| Sunday | | | |\n\n![Image: Sample completed tracking sheet](placeholder-image)\n\n## Getting Back on Track\n\nEveryone misses exercise days sometimes. Here's how to get back to your routine:\n\n1. **Be kind to yourself** - Don't get mad at yourself for missing days\n2. **Start small again** - Do a shorter workout to get back into it\n3. **Remember why you started** - Think about how good exercise makes you feel\n4. **Adjust your plan** - Maybe you need a different time of day or activity\n\n**Remember:** Missing a few days doesn't erase your progress!\n\n## Over to You\n\nTake some time to create your own motivation plan:\n\n1. Write down three physical activities you enjoy\n2. Choose one small activity to do this week\n3. Decide when and where you'll do it in your home\n4. Think about who in your household could support you\n5. Plan how you'll track your progress using the methods we discussed\n\n## Check Your Understanding\n\nTake a moment to think about what you've learned. The key points to remember are:\n\nInternal motivation comes from enjoying the activity itself, while external motivation comes from rewards or praise. Starting with small amounts of exercise helps you build the habit without getting overwhelmed. You can track progress using a calendar, journal, or chart. If you miss exercise days, be kind to yourself and start again with a shorter session. Family members can help by encouraging you or joining you in activities.\n\n## Keep Learning\n\nWant to learn more about staying motivated?

How do you feel before, during and after you exercise?\n\nEveryone has days when getting off the couch seems impossible. That's normal! What matters is having a few tricks up your sleeve for those days when motivation runs low.\n\n## Two Types of Motivation\n\nThere are two main ways we get motivated to be active:\n\n**Internal Motivation** - This comes from inside you:\n- The rush you get from swimming fast\n- The satisfaction when you finally nail a basketball shot\n- The energy boost you feel after a bike ride\n\n**External Motivation** - This comes from outside you:\n- Earning points in a fitness challenge\n- Your mom noticing your improved soccer skills\n- Avoiding losing video game privileges\n\n![Image: Two side-by-side illustrations showing internal motivation (person smiling while exercising) and external motivation (person receiving a medal)](placeholder-image)\n\nBoth types of motivation work, but internal motivation sticks around longer. When you actually look forward to shooting hoops or dancing, you'll keep at it without anyone pushing you.\n\n## Building Exercise Habits That Last\n\nThe best way to stay active is to make exercise a regular habit.

No problem!**\n- Use soup cans for bicep curls\n- Do step-ups on the bottom stair\n- Jump over rolled-up towels in an obstacle course\n- Play catch with a balled-up sock\n\n![Image: Child exercising at home using household items](placeholder-image)\n\n## Safety First!\n- Always warm up for 5 minutes before exercising\n- Start with easier versions of exercises\n- Stop if you feel pain (not just muscle tiredness)\n- Drink water before, during and after activity\n- Make sure you have enough space to move safely\n\n## Tracking Your Progress\n\nSeeing your improvement helps you stay motivated!\n\n**Simple ways to track progress:**\n- Color in squares on a calendar for days you exercise\n- Jot down minutes spent being active\n- Rate your mood after exercising (1-5 stars)\n- Count how many jumping jacks you can do without stopping\n\n## Over to You\nUse the template below to create your own tracking sheet.

The key points to remember are:\n\nInternal motivation comes from the joy of dancing or the pride in beating your running time. External motivation happens when someone gives you a high-five for exercising. Small, regular sessions build stronger habits than rare long workouts. Missing a day isn't failing - it's just part of the process. Your calendar or chart shows your progress over time, which keeps you going when motivation dips.\n\n## Keep Learning\n\nWant to learn more about staying motivated?
