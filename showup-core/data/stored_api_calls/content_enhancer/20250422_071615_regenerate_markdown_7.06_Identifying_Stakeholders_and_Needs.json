They might include users who will directly interact with your robot, people who will benefit from its work, and even those who might be worried about its operation.\n\nTo identify stakeholders, ask yourself questions like:\n- Who will use the robot?\n- Who will benefit from the robot's actions?\n- Who might be worried about the robot operating in their space?\n- Who will maintain or fix the robot?\n\nFor example, if you're designing a robot to help in a school cafeteria, stakeholders might include students, cafeteria staff, custodians, and school administrators.\n\nOnce you've identified stakeholders, you need to understand what they really need. This might involve:\n- Talking with potential users\n- Watching how things work now\n- Sending out surveys\n- Creating user personas (made-up characters that represent different types of users)\n\nUnderstanding these needs helps make sure your robot will actually be useful and accepted by the people it's designed to help.\n\n### **Setting Constraints and Requirements**\n\n**Constraints** are the limitations your solution must work within. They might include:\n\n- Physical constraints: size, weight, or the environment where the robot will operate\n- Technical constraints: available power sources, materials, or technology\n- Time constraints: deadlines for completion or how quickly the robot must perform tasks\n- Budget constraints: how much money is available for building and maintaining the robot\n- Safety constraints: making sure the robot won't harm people or property\n\n**Requirements** are the specific things your solution must do or have. For example:\n- The robot must be able to climb stairs\n- The robot must operate for at least 3 hours on a single charge\n- The robot must be controllable by someone with limited hand mobility\n\nClearly defining these constraints and requirements early helps prevent wasted effort on solutions that won't work in the real world. They act as guardrails for your creativity, keeping your ideas practical and doable.\n\n## **Activity 1: Problem Definition Workshop**\n\nTry writing problem statements for given robotics scenarios using a structured template. For each scenario, identify the affected stakeholders, list the constraints, and define success criteria. Complete at least two scenario exercises to build your problem definition skills.\n\n## **Problem Analysis Techniques**\n\nOnce you've identified a problem, it's important to dig deeper to fully understand it. Just like a doctor doesn't give medicine without first figuring out what's wrong, we shouldn't jump to solutions without thoroughly analyzing the problem.\n\n### **Root Cause Analysis**\n\nRoot cause analysis helps us look beyond the symptoms of a problem to find what's really causing it. Two popular techniques for this are:\n\nThe **\"5 Whys\"** technique involves asking \"why\" repeatedly to dig deeper into a problem. For example:\n- Why is the hallway delivery robot stopping unexpectedly? Because its sensors detect obstacles.\n- Why are sensors detecting obstacles when none are visible? Because reflections from the floor tiles are confusing the sensors.\n- Why are reflections causing confusion? Because the sensor algorithm can't tell the difference between real obstacles and reflections.\n- Why can't the algorithm tell these apart? Because it was programmed for dull surfaces, not shiny floors.\n- Why was it programmed this way? Because the original testing environment had different flooring.\n\nBy the fifth \"why,\" we've found a root cause we can fix - the sensor algorithm needs updating for shiny floors.\n\nUsing these techniques helps make sure you're solving the real problem, not just treating symptoms.\n",
  "instructions": "Review the attached robotics course material for middle school students in an asynchronous learning environment, applying the following targeted improvements:\n\n1. Address knowledge gaps without re-explaining fundamental concepts (like \"input\" or \"sensor\") that contextually appear to be previously introduced\n2. Enhance content flow to ensure logical progression between concepts\n3. Add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity\n4. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replace overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms appropriate for middle school comprehension levels when a term would likely create a barrier to learning\n\nEdit constraints:\n- Maximum 10% text modification\n- Preserve all formatting, headings, and document structure\n- Maintain exactly one empty line between paragraphs\n- Vocabulary simplification should be used sparingly and only for terms that would genuinely impede comprehension\n- Return content unchanged if no meaningful improvements are identified",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the key concepts involved in identifying stakeholders and defining requirements for a robotics solution. It covers the importance of understanding stakeholder needs, as well as defining constraints and requirements to guide the design process. The content also introduces problem analysis techniques like root cause analysis to deeply understand the problem before attempting to solve it.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Address any knowledge gaps without re-explaining fundamental concepts that have been previously introduced.\n2. Enhance the content flow to ensure a logical progression between concepts.\n3. Add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity.\n4. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replace overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms appropriate for middle school comprehension levels, but only when a term would likely create a barrier to learning.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target audience is middle school students (ages 11-14) with varying exposure to STEM concepts, potentially their first formal introduction to robotics.\n- Content should be written at a 5th-6th grade reading level, using everyday words familiar to this age group.\n- Sentence structure should be simple, with 15-20 words per sentence maximum, and content should be presented in an active, conversational tone.\n- Frequent headings, subheadings, bullet points, and visual elements (images, diagrams, labeled illustrations) should be used to break up information into clear, digestible \"chunks.\"\n- Real-world examples and storytelling elements should be incorporated to make technical concepts more relatable.\n- Overall, the content should be structured and presented in a way that supports the learning styles and needs of middle school students in an asynchronous online environment.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is being prepared for an asynchronous online learning environment, with no opportunities for peer interaction. As such, the content must be self-contained and able to guide learners through the material independently. Formatting, organization, and visual elements will be particularly important to maintain engagement and comprehension in this delivery medium.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose and structure of the current content, which provides a solid foundation for understanding stakeholder identification, constraint definition, and problem analysis.\n- Enhance the flow and continuity between concepts to ensure a logical progression, without significantly altering the original content.\n- Simplify vocabulary and language only when absolutely necessary to address potential comprehension barriers for the target middle school audience, while maintaining the educational integrity of the material.\n- Incorporate more visual elements, real-world examples, and storytelling to make the content more engaging and relatable for the target learners.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content to identify any knowledge gaps or areas where the flow could be improved without re-explaining fundamental concepts.\n2. Evaluate the language and vocabulary used throughout the content, and determine if any terms should be simplified for the target middle school audience (using the \"failsafe\" guideline provided in the enhancement prompt).\n3. Incorporate additional visual elements, such as images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations, to support the key concepts and make the content more engaging.\n4. Add minimal signposting phrases (e.g., \"In this section, we'll explore...\", \"Next, let's consider...\") only where critical for learning continuity, without disrupting the overall flow.\n5. Review the enhanced content to ensure it maintains the educational integrity of the original material while effectively addressing the needs of the target middle school learners in an asynchronous online environment.",
