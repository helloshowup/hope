  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the five main components of physical fitness: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. It explains what each component is, why it matters, and suggests fun activities to develop those fitness areas. The content is structured around learning objectives and includes brief \"quick demo\" sections to engage the learner.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Add linking paragraphs between the sections on the five fitness components to improve flow and readability.\n2. Incorporate a focused checkpoint within the content that encourages learners to pause and reflect on how the concepts connect to their existing knowledge or experience.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Audience: 11-14 year old students in a middle school physical education course\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use everyday language familiar to 11-12 year olds, with short sentences, active voice, and minimal jargon. Formatting should include frequent headings, bullet points, and visual elements to support comprehension.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is intended for an asynchronous online learning environment with no peer interaction. Considerations include:\n- Ensuring all key information can be understood without an instructor present\n- Designing the content in \"chunks\" with visual breaks to maintain engagement\n- Providing clear instructions and safety guidelines for any physical activities\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity of the content by accurately explaining the five fitness components\n- Address the specific enhancement requirements from the prompt to improve flow and add a reflective checkpoint\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school learner profile\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium, incorporating visual elements and clear instructions\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify the core purpose, structure, and key concepts related to the five fitness components.\n2. Craft linking paragraphs between the sections on each fitness component to improve the overall flow and readability of the content.\n3. Develop a focused checkpoint within the content that encourages learners to pause and reflect on how the concepts connect to their existing knowledge or experience. Format this checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question.\n4. Ensure the language, examples, and complexity of the content are appropriate for the 5th-6th grade reading level and middle school learner profile.\n5. Incorporate visual elements, such as images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations, to support comprehension and engagement in the asynchronous online environment.\n6. Provide clear instructions and safety guidelines for any physical activities to enable independent learning without an instructor present.\n7. Review the enhanced content to verify it maintains the educational integrity of the original material while addressing the specific requirements and adapting to the target learner and learning medium.",

There are five main parts of fitness that work together - each one gives you different physical powers!\n\n## The Five Components of Fitness\nThink of your fitness as having five important pieces that fit together like a puzzle. Just like you need different school supplies for different subjects, your body needs different types of fitness to do all the amazing things you do every day - from running to catch the bus to carrying your backpack to reaching for something on a high shelf.\n\n### Cardiovascular Endurance: Heart & Lung Power\nLet's start with the fitness component that powers everything else you do. Have you ever noticed how your heart beats faster when you run around with friends? That's your cardiovascular system in action!\n\n**What it is:** Your heart and lungs' ability to work for a long time without getting tired\n\n**Why it matters:** Helps you play longer without getting out of breath\n\n**Fun activities:** Running, swimming, dancing, biking, playing tag\n\n**Quick demo:** Try 30 seconds of jumping jacks and feel your heartbeat. Notice how your breathing gets faster!\n\n### Muscular Strength: Muscle Power\nNow that we understand how important our heart and lungs are, let's talk about another key part of fitness - the power in your muscles. Think about times when you need that extra burst of strength, like when you're climbing up a rope in gym class or helping carry groceries from the car.\n\n**What it is:** How much force your muscles can produce (how strong you are)\n\n**Why it matters:** Helps you lift heavy things and perform strong movements\n\n**Fun activities:** Push-ups, climbing, resistance bands, carrying grocery bags\n\n**Quick demo:** Try a modified wall push-up (pushing away from a wall while standing) and feel which muscles work\n\n### Muscular Endurance: Muscle Stamina\nWhile strength is about how powerful your muscles are in a single moment, endurance is about how long they can keep working. These two muscle abilities work as partners, but they help you in different ways throughout your day.\n\n**What it is:** How long your muscles can work without getting tired\n\n**Why it matters:** Helps you maintain good posture and do activities for longer periods\n\n**Fun activities:** Plank holds, sit-ups, squats, playing on monkey bars\n\n**Quick demo:** Try holding a wall-sit (back against wall, knees bent like sitting in an invisible chair) for 15-30 seconds\n\n### Flexibility: Body Bendiness\nHaving strong muscles is great, but what happens if you can't move them through their full range? That's where flexibility comes in - it's like the secret ingredient that makes all your other fitness components work better together.\n\n**What it is:** How far your joints can move and how stretchy your muscles are\n\n**Why it matters:** Helps prevent injuries and makes everyday movements easier\n\n**Fun activities:** Stretching, yoga, dancing, martial arts\n\n**Quick demo:** Try a simple seated hamstring stretch (reaching for your toes while sitting)\n\n### Body Composition: Muscle and Fat Balance\nThe final piece of our fitness puzzle looks at what your body is actually made of. Everyone's body is unique, with different amounts of muscle, bone, and fat - kind of like how everyone in your class has different heights and shoe sizes.\n\n**What it is:** The balance between muscle, bone, and fat in your body\n\n**Why it matters:** Affects your overall health and how efficiently your body works\n\n**How to improve it:** Regular physical activity and balanced nutrition\n\n**Important note:** All body types are different, and the goal is health, not a specific appearance\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about your favorite physical activity or sport. Which of the five fitness components do you use the most when doing this activity? For example, if you enjoy soccer, you might use cardiovascular endurance when running up and down the field, or if you like climbing, you might rely on muscular strength to pull yourself up. How could improving the other fitness components help you get even better at your favorite activity?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\nNow you understand how the five components of fitness work together to keep your body healthy and strong. Everyone starts at different levels, so focus on improving your own fitness rather than comparing yourself to others. By including activities that develop all five components in your routine, you're on your way to becoming fitter, stronger and more energized!\n\n---keytakeaways---\n\n---keytakeawaysEND---"
