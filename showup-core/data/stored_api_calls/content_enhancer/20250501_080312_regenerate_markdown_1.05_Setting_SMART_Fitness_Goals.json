SMART goals are your secret weapon for turning fitness wishes into actual plans you can follow. They're a brilliant way to take charge of your health and fitness journeyâ€”and they work for all sorts of activities you enjoy!\n\n## What Are SMART Fitness Goals?\nSMART is a handy way to remember the five parts of a good goal:\n\n**S - Specific**: Your goal should clearly state exactly what you want to do.\n*Instead of: \"I want to get better at running.\"*\n*Try: \"I want to run a full mile without stopping.\"*\n\n**M - Measurable**: Your goal needs a way to track your progress.\n*Instead of: \"I want to get stronger.\"*\n*Try: \"I want to do 15 push-ups in a row.\"*\n\n**A - Achievable**: Your goal should be challenging but possible for you right now.\n*Instead of: \"I'll do 100 sit-ups tomorrow.\"*\n*Try: \"I'll work up to doing 25 sit-ups by practising a little more each week.\"*\n\n**R - Relevant**: Your goal should matter to YOU and connect to activities you enjoy.\n*Instead of: \"I should join the swim team because my friend did.\"*\n*Try: \"I want to improve my basketball skills because I love playing with my friends.\"*\n\n**T - Time-bound**: Your goal needs a deadline to help you stay on track.\n*Instead of: \"Someday I'll be more flexible.\"*\n*Try: \"I will be able to touch my toes by the end of this month.\"*\n\n## Examples of SMART Fitness Goals for Middle Schoolers\nHere are some SMART fitness goals that might spark your imagination:\n\n- \"I will run a mile without stopping by the end of this term.\"\n- \"I will do 10 proper push-ups in a row by winter break.\"\n- \"I will stretch for 10 minutes after school three days a week for the next month.\"\n- \"I will try a new physical activity (like skating or hiking) twice this month.\"\n- \"I will drink at least 6 cups of water every day this week.\"\n\n## Creating Your Own SMART Fitness Goals\nNow it's your turn! Follow these steps to create your own SMART fitness goal:\n\n1. Think about what physical activities you enjoy and what you'd like to improve.\n2. Choose one specific thing you want to accomplish.\n3. Make sure you can measure your progress somehow.\n4. Be honest about what's achievable for you right now.\n5. Pick something that matters to you personally.\n6. Set a clear deadline for when you want to reach your goal.\n\n## Activity: SMART Fitness Goal Worksheet\nComplete this worksheet to create your own SMART fitness goal:\n\n1. **Specific**: What exactly do you want to accomplish?\n   _________________________________\n\n2. **Measurable**: How will you track your progress?\n   _________________________________\n\n3. **Achievable**: Why is this goal realistic for you?\n   _________________________________\n\n4. **Relevant**: Why does this goal matter to you?\n   _________________________________\n\n5. **Time-bound**: When will you achieve this goal?\n   _________________________________\n\n6. Put it all together! Write your complete SMART goal:\n   _________________________________\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nSetting SMART fitness goals is a valuable skill that will help you improve not just in PE class, but in sports, activities, and even other areas of your life! Remember that everyone starts at different levels, and the most important thing is to set goals that are right for YOU. By following the SMART method, you're taking a big step toward becoming healthier and more active. Keep tracking your progress, adjust your goals when needed, and celebrate your successes along the way!\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content. Insert this section after all main content and any activities/assessments, typically at the document end.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational piece on setting SMART fitness goals. It provides an overview of what SMART goals are, explains the meaning of each letter, gives examples of SMART fitness goals for middle schoolers, and guides the learner through the process of creating their own SMART fitness goal. The content is structured in a clear, step-by-step manner with relevant headings and examples.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Incorporate a focused checkpoint that invites learners to pause and reflect on how the concept of SMART goals connects to their existing knowledge or experience.\n2. Add a \"Key Takeaways\" section that extracts 1-3 critical concepts from the content.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an asynchronous online physical education course.\n- The content should be adapted to a 5th-6th grade reading level, using simple language, short sentences, and a conversational tone.\n- Visuals such as images, diagrams, and illustrations should be included to support understanding, especially for demonstrating proper exercise form and technique.\n- Examples and activities should be designed for a home-based learning environment with limited access to specialized fitness equipment.\n- Safety considerations and modifications for different physical abilities should be emphasized throughout.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online learning platform, with no opportunities for peer interaction or real-time instructor feedback. Therefore, the content must be self-contained, with clear instructions and ample visual support to guide the learner independently.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity of the content by preserving the core concepts of SMART goal-setting.\n- Enhance the content to be more engaging and relatable for the target middle school audience, using strategies like storytelling, real-world connections, and achievable challenges.\n- Ensure the content is appropriately adapted for the asynchronous online learning environment, with clear organization, frequent visual breaks, and opportunities for internal processing.\n- Emphasize safety, modifications, and creative solutions to accommodate the learners' limited access to specialized fitness equipment and varying home environments.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Incorporate a \"CHECKPOINT:\" section that prompts learners to pause and reflect on how the concept of SMART goals connects to their own experiences or prior knowledge. This could be a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring a written response.\n2. Add a \"## Key Takeaways\" section at the end of the content, extracting 1-3 concise bullet points that capture the essential concepts, distinctions, or applications presented in the material.\n3. Review the language, examples, and visuals throughout the content to ensure they are appropriate for the 5th-6th grade reading level and home-based learning environment of the target audience.\n4. Emphasize safety considerations, modifications, and creative solutions for equipment and space limitations to make the content accessible and engaging for all learners.\n5. Maintain the overall structure and flow of the content while enhancing it with strategies to improve engagement, such as storytelling, real-world connections, and achievable challenges.",
