The right power source depends on what the robot needs to do, where it will operate, and how long it needs to work without recharging or refueling.\n\nBatteries are the most common way to power mobile robots because they store energy that can be used anywhere. There are several types of batteries used in robotics:\n\nLithium-ion batteries are popular in many robots because they pack a lot of energy into a small, lightweight package. These are the same type of batteries used in smartphones and laptops. They can be recharged hundreds of times and provide steady power. However, they can be expensive and may overheat if damaged.\n\nAlkaline batteries (like AA or AAA batteries) are sometimes used in simple or educational robots. They're cheap and easy to find but can't be recharged and don't last very long for power-hungry robots.\n\nLead-acid batteries, like the ones in cars, are heavier but less expensive than lithium-ion. They're often used in larger robots that don't need to be very lightweight, such as some robotic lawnmowers.\n\nNewer battery technologies are always being developed. For example, solid-state batteries promise to be safer and hold more energy than current lithium-ion batteries. Some experimental robots even use biological batteries that mimic how living creatures produce energy!\n\n### **Direct Power Connections**\n\nSome robots don't use batteries at all - instead, they plug directly into a power outlet. These robots are called \"tethered\" because they're connected by a power cord.\n\nTethered robots have some big advantages. They never run out of power and can operate continuously for as long as needed. They can also use more power-hungry components since they don't need to worry about conserving battery life. Factory robots that work in the same spot all day often use direct power connections.\n\nThe main disadvantage is obvious - limited mobility! A tethered robot can only go as far as its power cord allows. This makes tethered power best for robots that work in a fixed location or a small area. The cord can also get in the way or become tangled.\n\nSome robots use a hybrid approach, operating on battery power but automatically returning to a charging station when their batteries run low. This gives them freedom to move while solving the problem of limited battery life.\n\n### **Alternative and Renewable Power Sources**\n\nEngineers are developing exciting new ways to power robots that are more sustainable and can work in remote locations:\n\nSolar-powered robots use panels that convert sunlight into electricity. These robots can potentially operate for very long periods in sunny environments without needing to recharge. NASA's Mars rovers use solar panels to power their exploration of the red planet. The limitation is that they need sunlight to work effectively.\n\nFuel cells generate electricity through chemical reactions, often using hydrogen. They can provide more power than batteries of the same weight and can be refueled quickly. Some experimental delivery robots use fuel cells for longer operating times.\n\nEnergy harvesting technologies allow robots to generate power from their environment. This might include collecting kinetic energy from the robot's own movements, temperature differences, or even from radio waves in the air. While these methods usually don't produce much power, they can help extend a robot's operating time.\n\nWireless power transfer is an emerging technology that allows robots to receive power without physical connections. Special charging pads or stations transmit energy through the air, which the robot can collect. This technology is still developing but could someday allow robots to charge automatically as they work.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** How might a robot's power source limit or expand its potential applications? Consider a robot designed for deep sea exploration - what power constraints would it face and how would these constraints affect its design and functionality?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- A robot's power source affects where it can work and for how long - batteries allow robots to move freely but eventually need recharging, while plugged-in robots can work non-stop but can't move far.\n- Different robot jobs need different power sources - small indoor robots typically use batteries, factory robots that stay in one place use direct power connections, and outdoor robots might use solar power.\n- Engineers are creating new ways to power robots that don't need to be plugged in or have batteries changed, like solar panels and systems that collect energy from the environment.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n",

The best power source depends on what the robot needs to do, where it will work, and how long it needs to run without recharging or refueling.\n\nBatteries are the most common way to power robots that move around because they store energy that can be used anywhere.

These robots are called \"tethered\" because they're connected by a power cord.\n\nTethered robots have some big advantages. They never run out of power and can work non-stop for as long as needed. They can also use parts that need more power since they don't have to save battery life. Factory robots that work in the same spot all day often use direct power connections.\n\nThe main downside is clear - they can't move around much! A tethered robot can only go as far as its power cord reaches. This makes tethered power best for robots that stay in one place or work in a small area. The cord can also get in the way or become tangled.\n\nSome robots use a mix of both approaches, running on battery power but automatically going back to a charging station when their batteries get low. This gives them freedom to move while fixing the problem of limited battery life.\n\n### **Alternative and Renewable Power Sources**\n\nEngineers are developing cool new ways to power robots that are better for the environment and can work in faraway places:\n\nSolar-powered robots use panels that turn sunlight into electricity. These robots can possibly work for very long times in sunny places without needing to recharge. NASA's Mars rovers use solar panels to power their exploration of the red planet. The drawback is that they need sunlight to work well.\n\nFuel cells make electricity through chemical reactions, often using hydrogen. They can provide more power than batteries of the same weight and can be refilled quickly. Some test delivery robots use fuel cells to work longer between charges.\n\nEnergy harvesting technologies let robots generate power from their surroundings. This might include collecting energy from the robot's own movements, temperature differences, or even from radio waves in the air. While these methods usually don't make much power, they can help a robot work longer.\n\nWireless power transfer is a new technology that lets robots get power without being plugged in. Special charging pads or stations send energy through the air, which the robot can collect.
