These records guide better exercise choices and help build lasting healthy habits. The self-monitoring skills you develop won't just improve your fitness—they'll be useful in many other parts of your life too.\n\nYou'll need:\n- A cardio log worksheet (printable version available in your course materials)\n- A pencil or pen\n- A timer or stopwatch (or a phone with a timer app)\n- Comfortable clothes for movement\n\n## Let's Begin!\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Your Cardio Log (10 minutes)\nYour cardio log tracks your exercise sessions. You'll write down:\n- The cardio activity you did (jumping jacks, running in place, etc.)\n- Your exercise duration (minutes)\n- How difficult it felt (scale: 1=easy to 5=very challenging)\n- Your feelings during and after (energized, tired, happy, etc.)\n\nLook at your cardio log worksheet now. Find each section where you'll record this information. Check the example in your materials to see a completed entry.\n\n### Step 2: Get Moving! (15-20 minutes)\nNow try some cardio! Choose from these exercises you can do at home:\n- Jumping jacks\n- High knees (run in place while lifting knees up high)\n- Butt kicks (jog while kicking heels toward your bottom)\n- Mountain climbers (in push-up position, bring knees to chest one at a time)\n\nSelect 3-4 exercises and do each for 1-2 minutes. Rest briefly between exercises if needed. Pay attention to your body's signals—faster heartbeat, heavier breathing, muscles working. Notice which activities feel easier or harder for you.\n\n### Step 3: Record Your Activity (5 minutes)\nFill out your cardio log immediately after finishing. Be truthful about how the workout felt—this record is for you to learn about yourself, not to impress anyone else!\n\n### Step 4: Over to You (10 minutes)\nAnswer these questions in your notebook:\n- Which activities did you enjoy most? Why?\n- Which activities felt the most challenging?\n- How did your body feel during different parts of the workout?\n- How do you feel now, after completing the workout?\n- What might you do differently next time?\n\n### Step 5: Set a Personal Cardio Goal (10 minutes)\nUsing what you learned today, create one specific cardio fitness goal. Make sure your goal is:\n- Specific (exactly what you want to accomplish)\n- Measurable (how you'll know if you've reached it)\n- Achievable (something you can realistically do)\n- Relevant (important to you personally)\n- Time-bound (when you plan to achieve it)\n\nExample: \"I will do 10 minutes of jumping jacks and high knees three times a week for the next two weeks.\"\n\nWrite your goal in your cardio log. Tell a family member about your goal if you can—sharing it helps you stick with it.\n\n## Wrap-Up\nToday you learned to track and reflect on your cardio activities. Your cardio log helps you identify patterns, set effective goals, and adjust your routine to boost fitness. This self-monitoring approach builds exercise habits that last.\n\nNext time, we'll explore different muscle groups and how they work together during exercise. Your cardio log will connect what you've learned about heart fitness with our upcoming focus on strength and flexibility.\n\n## Check Your Understanding\nTracking cardio activities shows your progress over time and helps you make smarter exercise choices. Record your activity type, how long you exercised, how hard it felt, and your physical and emotional responses. Looking for patterns reveals what works best for your body. Effective fitness goals follow the SMART format: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Your cardio tracking will link to our next lesson by showing how different exercises affect specific muscles and your overall fitness.\n\n## Take It Further\n- Use your cardio log at home to track walking, dancing, or active games\n- Design a personal cover for your cardio log to make it your own\n- Ask a family member how they keep track of their exercise or health habits\n- Look up different apps or websites that help people monitor fitness activities\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Tracking your cardio workouts helps you identify patterns and make better exercise choices that lead to lasting healthy habits.\n- Creating SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) gives your fitness journey clear direction and increases your chances of success.\n- Paying attention to how your body feels during and after exercise provides valuable feedback to guide your future workout decisions.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n",
