Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n   - You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n   - Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n   - Activity: Stand up and do 10 jumping jacks. Take a moment to notice how your breathing changes. Your body just used carbohydrates to power that movement.\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n   - Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n   - Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n   - Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n   - This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n   - Activity: Gently squeeze your arm muscle. The firmness you feel is made of protein that helps your body move.\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n   - Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n   - Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n   - Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n   - Your brain needs fats to work well\n   - We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items\n2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings\n4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in\n3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle\n4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)\n5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:\n   - Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)\n   - An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database\n   - A food guide chart (included below)\n\n### Example of Completed Activity:\n- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana\n- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt\n- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.\n- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.\n- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  * 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  * 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  * After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  * 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  * 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  * 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  * Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  * Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  * Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  * Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  * Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Knowledge Check and Application Activities\n\n### Knowledge Check Activity:\n1. On a piece of paper, create a three-column table with the headings \"Carbohydrates,\" \"Proteins,\" and \"Fats\"\n2. Under each heading, write at least 2 functions of that nutrient in your body\n3. List 3 food examples for each nutrient group\n4. Check your answers against the information in this lesson\n5. Success criteria: You should be able to identify at least 5 total nutrient functions correctly\n\n### My Performance Plate Activity:\n1. Materials needed: Paper, pencil, and coloring supplies (optional)\n2. Draw a circle to represent a plate\n3. Divide your plate according to the \"Perfect Plate\" guidelines above\n4. In each section, draw or write specific foods you would eat:\n   * Before your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"Before\")\n   * After your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"After\")\n5. For each plate, write why you chose those specific foods\n6. Success criteria: Your \"Before\" plate should include quick energy foods (mainly carbs), while your \"After\" plate should include recovery foods (protein and carbs)\n\n### Food Experiment (Optional Challenge):\n1. Choose one new performance-boosting food you haven't tried before\n2. Try eating this food before or after physical activity\n3. In a notebook, record:\n   * What food did you try?\n   * When did you eat it (before or after activity)?\n   * What physical activity did you do?\n   * How did you feel during/after the activity?\n   * Would you eat this food again before/after exercise? Why or why not?\n4. Success criteria: Complete the experiment and record your observations about how the food affected your energy or recovery\n\nRemember: Good food choices help your body perform better in everything you do! By understanding which nutrients your body needs and when, you can make smart choices to fuel your activities.",
  "instructions": "As a skilled curriculum editor with experience in educational flow and learner comprehension:\n\nReview my draft from two perspectives: \n1) As a learner and if you have an unanswered question briefly try and edit the draft so that you answer it. limit it to minor things that will enhance the flow and remove barriers to learning.  \n2) As an editor looking to reduce signposting repetition (\"Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies\") - vary these transitions while maintaining flow\n\nFor all edits: Ensure content remains conversational and connects ideas meaningfully. Make minimal wording changes while preserving instructional intent.\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the three main macronutrients - carbohydrates, proteins, and fats - and how they fuel the body for physical activity. It includes learning objectives, explanations of each nutrient's role, interactive activities to apply the concepts, and suggestions for balanced pre- and post-workout meals and snacks.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Review the content from the perspective of a learner and identify any areas that could be clarified or expanded to better address potential questions.\n2. Reduce repetitive signposting language (e.g., \"Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies\") while maintaining the flow and connection between ideas.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical Space/Equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday language, short sentences, and a conversational tone to engage this middle school audience. Visuals, step-by-step instructions, and real-world connections will be important to support comprehension and application.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is intended for asynchronous online delivery through Excel Middle School's curriculum, with no peer interaction. The format should be optimized for self-paced learning, with clear section organization, frequent visual breaks, and opportunities for active engagement.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content, which is to help students understand the role of macronutrients in fueling physical activity.\n- Address any gaps or areas of potential confusion identified from the learner's perspective.\n- Reduce repetitive language and transitions while preserving the logical flow and meaningful connections between ideas.\n- Adapt the content to the target learner's age, reading level, prior knowledge, and learning preferences.\n- Optimize the format and delivery for asynchronous online learning, considering the limitations of the medium.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the content through the lens of an 11-14 year old learner, noting any areas that could be clarified or expanded to better address potential questions.\n2. Identify opportunities to vary the transition language and signposting while maintaining the coherence of the instructional flow.\n3. Simplify complex or technical language, ensuring the content aligns with the 5th-6th grade reading level.\n4. Incorporate more visual elements, such as diagrams, illustrations, and real-world examples, to support comprehension and engagement.\n5. Break up longer sections into smaller, more manageable \"chunks\" with clear headings and subheadings.\n6. Include additional interactive activities or \"Stop and Think\" moments to reinforce the key concepts.\n7. Ensure the formatting and layout are optimized for self-paced, asynchronous online learning, with ample white space, consistent styling, and easy navigation.\n\nThe enhanced content should preserve the original educational value while addressing the specific needs of the target middle school learners and the constraints of the online delivery medium.",
