  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of various physical activity opportunities available to middle school students, including school-based programs, community resources, and free/low-cost options for home-based workouts. The content aims to help students identify ways to stay active and engaged in physical fitness, both within their local community and through online/at-home options.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives derived from the enhancement prompt are:\n1. Add transitional/linking paragraphs to improve the flow and cohesion of the content.\n2. Ensure the writing style and tone remain consistent with the target learner profile.\n3. Optimize the content for asynchronous online delivery, focusing on clear structure, visual elements, and engagement strategies.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learner is a group of 11-14 year old students enrolled in an online physical education course at Excel Middle School. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Reading level: 5th-6th grade on the Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: Simple, conversational English with minimal jargon\n- Prior knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts\n- Learning style: Visual demonstrations, hands-on activities, storytelling\n- Physical access: Limited specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should be adapted to this learner profile by:\n- Using age-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure\n- Incorporating more real-world examples and relatable narratives\n- Providing clear, step-by-step instructions for activities\n- Including ample visual aids like images, diagrams, and illustrations\n- Offering modifications and alternatives for different environments/equipment\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThis content is intended for asynchronous online delivery, with no opportunity for peer interaction. Key considerations for this medium include:\n- Ensuring clear, self-contained explanations without relying on external facilitation\n- Designing the content in \"chunks\" with visual breaks to maintain engagement\n- Incorporating interactive elements like checklists, tables, and reflection prompts\n- Optimizing for mobile/tablet viewing with concise paragraphs and ample white space\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core purpose of the content: Helping students discover and access a variety of physical activity opportunities.\n- Maintain the positive, encouraging tone while adapting the language and examples for the target learner.\n- Emphasize the accessibility and affordability of the suggested activities to promote inclusivity.\n- Ensure the content is structured in a logical flow with clear transitions between topics.\n- Incorporate more visual elements to support the asynchronous online delivery format.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify areas that could benefit from transitional/linking paragraphs to improve flow.\n2. Rewrite sections using language, examples, and formatting aligned with the 5th-6th grade reading level and learning preferences of the target audience.\n3. Incorporate more visual aids like images, diagrams, and illustrations to support the explanations and activity instructions.\n4. Design the content in clear, concise \"chunks\" with frequent headings, subheadings, and visual breaks to maintain engagement in the asynchronous online format.\n5. Include interactive elements like checklists, tables, and reflection prompts to foster active learning.\n6. Ensure all safety considerations, equipment alternatives, and space adaptations are clearly communicated.\n7. Review the enhanced content to verify it preserves the core purpose and value of the original material while optimizing for the target learner and learning medium.",

Let's explore the many places where you can get active - at school, around your neighborhood, or right at home!\n\n## Places to Be Active in Your Community\n\nThink about your neighborhood for a moment. There are probably more places to be active than you realize! From the playground at the corner to the community center downtown, opportunities for movement surround us. Some might be obvious, like sports fields, while others might be hidden gems you haven't discovered yet. In this section, we'll explore different places where you can get your body moving and have fun at the same time.\n\n### School Activities\n\nYour school is actually a treasure trove of physical activity options! Beyond regular PE class, there's a whole world of after-school activities waiting for you to explore. I remember when I was your age, joining the basketball club introduced me to some of my best friends. We practiced twice a week and even though I wasn't the best player, I improved a lot and had a blast. Your school probably offers similar opportunities that fit right into your daily schedule since you're already there.\n\n- After-school sports teams\n- Fitness clubs\n- Intramural games with your classmates\n\n### Activity: School Opportunities Inventory\n1. Complete this table of school activities:\n\n| Activity Type | Available at My School | I've Tried It | I Want to Try It |\n|---------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Sports Teams  |                        |               |                  |\n| Fitness Clubs |                        |               |                  |\n| Other Activities |                     |               |                  |\n\n<br/>\n2. For one activity you want to try, write down:\n\n- When and where it meets\n- What equipment you need\n- Who to contact to join (teacher name or email)\n\n### Parks and Recreation Centres\n\nHave you ever noticed how parks come alive on sunny weekends? Families playing catch, teenagers shooting hoops, and joggers circling the paths. These public spaces are designed for everyone to enjoy and stay active. The best part? Most of these places are completely free to use! Your tax dollars (well, your parents' tax dollars) help maintain these spaces, so they're basically yours to enjoy. Next time you pass by your local park, take a closer look at all the activity options it offers.\n\nMost communities have parks and recreation centers that offer:\n\n- Basketball courts where neighborhood games happen daily\n- Swimming pools with open swim hours and lessons\n- Walking trails that wind through natural areas\n- Sports fields for football, cricket, or rugby\n- Fitness classes designed specifically for your age group\n\n![Image: A community park with basketball courts, playground, and walking path]\n\n### Community Programmes\n\nBeyond your school walls and local parks, there's a whole network of community programs designed to get kids moving. These programs are often run by volunteers who are passionate about sharing their favorite activities with the next generation. I've seen kids discover lifelong hobbies through community programs they tried on a whim! These programs also give you a chance to meet people from different schools and neighborhoods, expanding your social circle while you get fit.\n\nYour area probably offers:\n\n- Youth sports leagues where you'll meet kids from other schools\n- Community events like Saturday morning fun runs or family bike days\n- Specialized classes in dance styles, martial arts forms, or beginner yoga\n\n## How to Find Activity Information\n\nWith so many options available, how do you find out what's actually happening in your area? It can feel overwhelming at first, but don't worry - the information is out there, and I'll show you how to find it. Think of yourself as a detective on a mission to uncover all the fun physical activities hiding in your community. The clues are everywhere once you know where to look!\n\nNow that you know what might be available, here's how to discover what's actually happening near you:\n\n<br/>\n1. Browse your school's website or scan the notice boards by the gym\n2. Visit your town's parks department website for seasonal program listings\n3. Search \"[your town name] + youth activities\" online (ask for help if needed)\n4. Check the community bulletin boards at your library or local shops\n5.

The sidewalk outside your door can become a running track. That empty driveway? A perfect basketball court. Even your living room can transform into a dance studio or yoga space with just a little creativity. The best part about neighborhood activities is that you can do them almost anytime - no need to wait for a specific class time or worry about transportation.\n\n- Walk the dog around the block or bike to a friend's house\n- Jump rope using an old piece of rope from the garage\n- Practice throwing and catching with a rolled-up pair of socks\n- Set up an obstacle course with pillows to jump over and chairs to crawl under\n\n### In Your Community\n\nCommunities often create free or low-cost opportunities for residents to stay active together. These shared experiences not only help you get fit but also build a sense of belonging in your neighborhood. I've seen communities transform through simple activities like weekly park clean-ups that double as exercise, or seasonal events that get everyone moving together. These community-based options often fly under the radar, but they're worth seeking out!\n\n- Visit the local playground and challenge yourself on the equipment\n- Join weekend community walks that start at the town center\n- Drop in during \"open gym\" hours when recreation centers welcome everyone\n- Ask directly about youth discounts - many places offer them but don't advertise widely\n\n## Online Workout Options\n\nThe internet has completely changed how we can stay active, bringing expert-led workouts right into our homes. On rainy days or busy evenings when you can't get outside, online workouts can save the day! With thousands of free videos available, you can try everything from hip-hop dance to martial arts without leaving your living room. This is especially helpful during school breaks or when your schedule gets too packed for regular activities.\n\nWhen the weather is bad or you can't leave home, online workouts are a great alternative:\n\n### Kid-Friendly Workout Videos\nFree exercise videos created specifically for middle schoolers include:\n\n- YouTube channels like PE with Joe or Fitness Blender's kid workouts\n- GoNoodle's energetic dance and movement activities\n- Cosmic Kids Yoga adventures that blend stories with stretching\n\n### Creating a Home Workout Space\nEven in tight spaces, you can create room to move:\n1.
