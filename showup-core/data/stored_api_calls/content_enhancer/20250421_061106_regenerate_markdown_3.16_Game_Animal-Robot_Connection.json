  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational activity focused on the connection between animals and robots. It asks learners to match animals to robots inspired by their movement patterns, then identify the specific features that were copied and the engineering advantages gained. The activity requires learners to understand biomimetic principles and apply them to analyze the relationship between natural and artificial systems.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Add bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n2. Ensure the content is appropriate for the target audience of 11-14 year old students with a 5th-6th grade reading level.\n3. Optimize the content for asynchronous online delivery, with a focus on clear explanations, visual elements, and engagement strategies.\n4. Preserve the core educational value and learning objectives of the original content while making necessary adaptations.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Use simple, familiar language and limit sentence length to 15-20 words.\n- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions using active voice and present tense.\n- Include relevant images, diagrams, and visual examples to support understanding.\n- Connect concepts to real-world examples and experiences familiar to middle school students.\n- Incorporate \"Stop and Think\" moments to encourage active processing of information.\n- Use a friendly, conversational tone to engage the learners.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. Ensure the formatting and structure are optimized for self-paced, independent learning without relying on instructor guidance or feedback.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Maintain the core learning objectives related to understanding biomimetic principles and the connection between animals and robots.\n2. Preserve the original content's educational integrity and logical flow while making necessary adaptations.\n3. Ensure the content is visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear signposting and organization.\n4. Incorporate engagement strategies to sustain the learners' interest and motivation throughout the activity.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify the key themes, concepts, and learning objectives.\n2. Analyze the enhancement prompt and extract the specific formatting requirements.\n3. Adapt the language, examples, and complexity of the content to align with the target learner profile.\n4. Incorporate visual elements, such as images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations, to support understanding.\n5. Restructure the content into clear, concise paragraphs with frequent headings and subheadings.\n6. Add \"Stop and Think\" moments and other engagement strategies to encourage active learning.\n7. Apply the required bold formatting to key terms, headers, and important concept labels.\n8. Ensure the overall content structure and formatting are optimized for asynchronous online delivery.\n9. Validate that the enhanced content preserves the original educational value while meeting the specified requirements.",
