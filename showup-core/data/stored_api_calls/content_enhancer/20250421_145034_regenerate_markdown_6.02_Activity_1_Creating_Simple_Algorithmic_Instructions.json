Write down the exact step-by-step instructions that a robot would need to follow to complete this task. Be extremely precise - remember that a robot will follow your instructions exactly as written!\n\nAfter writing your instructions, identify the inputs (what information or materials are needed), processing (what decisions or calculations need to be made), and outputs (what actions result) in your algorithm. Was anything challenging about creating these precise instructions? This exercise demonstrates why programming requires breaking down tasks into clear, unambiguous steps.\n\n## **Key Programming Concepts**\n\nUnderstanding programming requires familiarity with several fundamental concepts that apply across almost all programming contexts.\n\n### **Variables**\n\nVariables are containers that store information in a program. They can hold numbers, text, or more complex data that your program needs to remember and use later. For a robot, variables might store sensor readings, current motor speeds, or task states.\n\nThink of variables like labeled boxes where you can store different things. For example, you might have a variable called \"temperature\" that holds the current reading from a temperature sensor, or a variable called \"robotName\" that stores the text \"Botley.\" \n\nVariables are super useful because they let your program remember things. If your robot needs to know how far it has traveled, you could create a variable called \"distance\" and update it as the robot moves. Without variables, your robot would have no memory of what it has done or what it has detected!\n\n### **Conditionals**\n\nConditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The classic form is \"if-then-else\": If something is true, then do this action; otherwise, do something different. Conditionals let robots respond differently to different situations.\n\nConditionals are like forks in the road for your robot. They allow your program to ask questions and take different paths based on the answers. For example:\n\n```\nIF light sensor detects darkness\nTHEN turn on headlights\nELSE keep headlights off\n```\n\nThis simple conditional lets your robot make a decision based on its environment. Conditionals are what make robots seem \"smart\" because they can respond appropriately to different situations rather than just following the same steps every time.\n\n### **Loops**\n\nLoops allow a program to repeat actions multiple times without writing the same code repeatedly. For example, a robot might need to check a sensor repeatedly while moving, or perform the same action until a certain condition is met.\n\nLoops are like having the robot repeat instructions over and over again. Instead of writing \"move forward\" ten times in your program, you can use a loop to say \"repeat 'move forward' ten times.\" This makes your code much shorter and easier to understand.\n\nThere are different types of loops. Some repeat a specific number of times (like \"do this 5 times\"), while others keep repeating until something specific happens (like \"keep checking for obstacles until you reach the finish line\"). Loops are essential for robots that need to perform repetitive tasks or continuously monitor their environment.\n\n### **Functions**\n\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help organize code and reduce repetition. For robots, you might create functions for common behaviors like \"turn left\" or \"check obstacle\" that can be used throughout a program.\n\nFunctions are like mini-programs within your main program. They're sets of instructions grouped together under a single name that you can use whenever you need them. For example, if your robot needs to perform a complex dance move multiple times during a routine, you could create a function called \"spinAndBeep\" that contains all the steps for that move.\n\nFunctions make programming easier because:\n- You write the instructions once and can use them many times\n- Your program becomes more organized and easier to understand\n- If you need to change how something works, you only need to change it in one place\n\nThink of functions like recipes in a cookbook. Once you've written down the recipe for chocolate chip cookies, you can just say \"make chocolate chip cookies\" instead of listing all the ingredients and steps every time.\n",
