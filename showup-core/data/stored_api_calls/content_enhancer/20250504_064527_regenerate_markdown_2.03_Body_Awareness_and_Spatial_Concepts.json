These skills help you move safely and effectively, giving you the foundation needed for success in sports, games, and everyday movement. \n\nThis lesson builds on our previous work with non-locomotor movements and sets you up for future balance and coordination activities.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Distinguish between personal space and general space\n- Demonstrate directional movements (forward, backward, sideways, up, down)\n- Move your body at different levels (high, medium, low)\n- Create various body shapes (wide, narrow, curved, twisted)\n- Apply spatial awareness in simple movement challenges\n\nLet's warm up with a quick activity called \"Space Invaders\" that you can do at home:\n\n1. Find an open area in your home where you have room to move\n2. When you say \"personal space bubble\" to yourself, extend your arms to show your bubble\n3. When you say \"general space move,\" walk carefully through your available space\n4. When you stop, ask yourself: \"Am I in my own personal space? How do I know?\"\n\nThink of your **body awareness** as your internal navigation system - it helps you know where you are and how to move safely!\n\n## Personal vs. General Space (10 minutes)\nLet's understand the difference:\n\n**Personal space**: The bubble around your body that moves with you - about arm's length in all directions\n\n**General space**: The shared area you move through - like the open space in your home\n\nActivity: \"Space Explorer\"\n1. Stand in your space and create your \"personal space bubble\" by reaching in all directions\n2. Make different shapes within your bubble (tall, small, wide, twisted)\n3. Practice moving through your general space using different movements (walking, skipping) while being aware of furniture and objects\n4. Think about: When do you need to be aware of personal space? (in stores, playing sports, dancing)\n\n## Directional Movements (10 minutes)\nThe main directions are:\n\n**Forward/backward**: Moving toward/away from where you're facing\n\n**Sideways**: Moving to your right or left side\n\n**Up/down**: Moving toward the ceiling or floor\n\nActivity: \"Direction Detective\"\n1. Follow this simple movement sequence:\n   - 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward\n   - 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left\n   - Reach up high, crouch down low\n2. Create your own sequence with 6-8 movements\n3. Challenge: Can you move in two directions at once? (like sideways and up)\n\n## Levels of Movement (10 minutes)\nThe three main levels are:\n\n**High level**: Movements that reach toward the ceiling (jumping, reaching up)\n\n**Medium level**: Movements at waist or chest height (walking, arm circles)\n\n**Low level**: Movements close to the floor (crawling, crouching)\n\nActivity: \"Level Shifters\"\n1. Create three signs on paper labeled \"high,\" \"medium,\" and \"low\" and place them where you can see them\n2. Play some music if available, or count to 20 in your head\n3. Move freely while the music plays or while counting\n4. When the music stops or you reach 20, choose one of your level cards\n5. Create a movement or shape at that level\n6. Think about: What sports use different levels? Basketball (all levels), bowling (low), volleyball (high)\n\n## Body Shapes (10 minutes)\nFour basic body shapes are:\n\n**Wide**: Stretching out to take up more space (star jump)\n\n**Narrow**: Making yourself thin or skinny (pencil position)\n\n**Curved**: Creating rounded shapes with your body (ball shape)\n\n**Twisted**: Rotating parts of your body in different directions (twist at waist)\n\nActivity: \"Shape Shifter\"\n1. Create each shape one at a time: wide, narrow, curved, and twisted\n2. Play \"Shape Freeze Dance\" - play music or count to 15, then stop and make one of the shapes\n3. Challenge yourself: Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together\n4. Record your sequence if possible, or practice it until you can perform it smoothly\n\n## Conclusion and Assessment (5 minutes)\nTest your understanding with the \"Spatial Awareness Challenge\":\n1. Give yourself prompts like:\n   - \"Show me a wide shape at a high level\"\n   - \"Move backward at a low level\"\n   - \"Create a twisted shape in your personal space\"\n   - \"Travel sideways through general space at a medium level\"\n\nTake a moment to think about how well you performed these movements. Could you create the shapes easily? Did you maintain awareness of your space?\n\n## Over to You\n- Why is spatial awareness important in physical education?\n- How might these skills help you in your favorite sport or activity?\n- What did you find challenging about today's activities?\n\nThese skills connect to our previous work on non-locomotor movements and will help with our upcoming activities on balance and coordination.\n\n## Extensions and Adaptations\n- For extra challenge: Try combining multiple concepts (create a twisted shape while moving backward at a low level)\n- For support: Draw the different shapes and levels on paper as visual reminders\n- Connection to other subjects: These directions relate to math (coordinate planes) or dance (choreography)\n- Technology option: Record a video of your movements for self-assessment",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Authenticity Enhancement\n\nRefine educational content to eliminate formulaic AI writing patterns while preserving structural integrity and educational substance.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a pattern analysis by identifying:\n1. Predictable comparison structures (\"think of X as Y\", \"imagine X is Y\")\n2. Overused intensifiers and generic language\n3. Formulaic transition phrases\n4. Artificial enthusiasm markers\n5. Repetitive explanation patterns\n\n## REFINEMENT REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Maintain ALL original section headings exactly as written\n   - Preserve all educational substance and learning objectives\n   - Maintain the overall document structure and organization\n   \n2. PATTERN ELIMINATION (IMPORTANT):\n   - Replace predictable metaphors and comparison frameworks\n   - Substitute generic intensifiers with specific descriptions\n   - Convert formulaic transitions to natural connections\n   - Replace artificial excitement markers with inherently interesting content\n   - Eliminate \"framework\" language and digital era clich√©s\n   \n3. AUTHENTIC VOICE ENHANCEMENT (SUPPORTING):\n   - Vary sentence structure and length throughout\n   - Replace generic explanations with specific examples\n   - Add natural language variations and conversational elements\n   - Create authentic progression between ideas\n\n## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1.
