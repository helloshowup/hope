When engineers clearly understand what they're trying to solve, they're much more likely to create effective solutions.\n\nFor example, compare these two problem statements:\n- Poor: \"We need a robot that does stuff in the classroom.\"\n- Good: \"We need a robot that can safely navigate around classroom furniture to deliver materials to student groups while operating for at least 2 hours on a single battery charge.\"\n\nThe first statement is vague and provides almost no guidance. The second clearly defines what the robot needs to do, where it will operate, and a specific performance requirement. Teams working with the second statement will have a much clearer direction and can evaluate whether their solutions actually solve the problem.\n\nWell-defined problems save time, reduce frustration, and lead to more successful robotics projects. Throughout this lesson, we'll learn how to craft these clear problem statements and use them to guide our solution development.\n\n## **Defining the Problem**\n\nBefore we can build a robot to solve a problem, we need to understand exactly what that problem is. Imagine trying to build a bridge without knowing what river it needs to cross or what kind of traffic it needs to support! The same applies to robotics - we need a clear picture of the problem before we can design an effective solution.\n\nIn robotics, a well-defined problem helps us determine what sensors our robot might need, what actions it should perform, and what success looks like. Without this clarity, we might build something that doesn't actually solve the real issue or misses important requirements.\n\n### **Elements of a Strong Problem Statement**\n\nA strong problem statement is like a roadmap for your robotics project. It should include several key elements that guide your design process:\n\nFirst, it needs a clear description of the issue - what's happening that shouldn't be, or what isn't happening that should be? For example, \"Students with mobility challenges cannot easily access books from the top shelves in our library.\"\n\nSecond, it should define the scope - what parts of the problem will your solution address, and what parts won't it address? For instance, \"Our solution will focus on retrieving books from shelves, not on cataloging or reshelving them.\"\n\nThird, include measurable success criteria - how will you know if your solution works? For example, \"The robot should be able to retrieve a requested book within 2 minutes and deliver it safely to the student.\"\n\nWhen these elements come together, they create a clear target for your design efforts and help everyone understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish.\n\n### **Problem Statement Template**\n\nHere's a simple template you can use to create your own problem statements:\n\n\"The problem is that [describe the issue] affecting [who is affected]. A successful solution would [measurable outcome] while [important constraints].\"\n\nFor example:\n\"The problem is that students waste time walking to the recycling bins during class, affecting learning time. A successful solution would reduce classroom interruptions by 50% while keeping recycling properly sorted.\"\n\nThis template helps you organize your thoughts and ensures you cover all the important parts of a good problem statement.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you tried to solve a problem but weren't exactly sure what you needed to fix. Maybe it was building something, fixing a toy, or helping with a project at home. How did not having a clear problem make things harder? How might having a clear problem statement have helped you?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "Review the attached robotics course material for middle school students in an asynchronous learning environment, applying the following targeted improvements:\n\n1. Address knowledge gaps without re-explaining fundamental concepts (like \"input\" or \"sensor\") that contextually appear to be previously introduced\n2. Enhance content flow to ensure logical progression between concepts\n3. Add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity\n4. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replace overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms appropriate for middle school comprehension levels when a term would likely create a barrier to learning\n\nEdit constraints:\n- Maximum 10% text modification\n- Preserve all formatting, headings, and document structure\n- Maintain exactly one empty line between paragraphs\n- Vocabulary simplification should be used sparingly and only for terms that would genuinely impede comprehension\n- Return content unchanged if no meaningful improvements are identified",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on \"Defining Problems and Researching Solutions\" as part of a robotics course for middle school students. It focuses on the importance of crafting well-defined problem statements to guide the robotics design process. The content covers the key elements of a strong problem statement, provides a template for creating them, and includes a reflective checkpoint for students.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Address any knowledge gaps without re-explaining fundamental concepts that have been previously introduced.\n2. Enhance the content flow to ensure logical progression between concepts.\n3. Add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity.\n4. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Replace overly complex vocabulary with more accessible terms appropriate for middle school comprehension levels, but only when a term would likely create a barrier to learning.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds, limit sentence length, write in active voice and present tense, and avoid jargon by defining necessary technical terms immediately. Formatting should include frequent headings, bullet points, and visual elements like images and diagrams to support comprehension.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is intended for an asynchronous online learning environment with no peer interaction. Formatting and structure should be optimized for this self-paced, independent learning format.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content\n- Preserve the original structure, headings, and formatting\n- Enhance content flow and logical progression between concepts\n- Simplify vocabulary only when necessary to avoid comprehension barriers\n- Incorporate visual elements and engagement strategies to support middle school learners\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content to identify any knowledge gaps or areas where the flow could be improved.\n2. Enhance content transitions and add minimal signposting phrases only where critical for learning continuity.\n3. [FAILSAFE ONLY] Simplify overly complex vocabulary, but only for terms that would genuinely impede comprehension at the 5th-6th grade reading level.\n4. Incorporate additional visual elements like images, diagrams, and examples to support middle school learners.\n5. Maintain the overall structure, formatting, and intent of the original content.\n6. Return the content unchanged if no meaningful improvements are identified within the 10% text modification constraint.",
