  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures.

  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of how color, typography, and composition work together to shape the emotional atmosphere and first impressions of a design. It covers key color psychology principles, the role of typography in conveying tone, and how holistic design elements contribute to an overall brand aesthetic. The content is structured to introduce these concepts through visual comparisons and real-world examples.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Add a paragraph to clarify that the content is focused on graphic design principles, not interior design, and make a smooth transition to discussing typography.\n2. Ensure the writing style remains natural and conversational, avoiding overly academic or AI-like language.\n3. Preserve the core educational value and practical application of the content while enhancing it for the target learner.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- The target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students preparing for professional careers. They have foundational design knowledge but are now developing specialized skills.\n- They are highly self-motivated, visually-oriented learners who benefit from interactive digital content and practical, industry-relevant instruction.\n- The content should be tailored to their current skill level, using appropriate technical terminology and examples that resonate with their design interests and career goals.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\n- The content will be delivered through both in-person sessions and online learning platforms, so it must be optimized for asynchronous digital consumption.\n- Learners will access the content independently, so it should be structured in a clear, modular format with ample visual aids and opportunities for self-reflection.\n- Any interactive elements or exercises should be designed for seamless integration within the online learning environment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and practical value of the original content while enhancing it for the target learner.\n- Ensure a smooth transition between the discussion of color and typography, clearly establishing the relevance to graphic design.\n- Incorporate more interactive elements, such as self-assessment activities or design challenges, to engage the learners and reinforce key concepts.\n- Provide additional context and examples that are directly relevant to the learners' interests and design specializations.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Craft a bridging paragraph that connects the discussion of color in design to the role of typography, framing both as essential elements of graphic design that shape audience perception and brand atmosphere.\n2. Enhance the typography section with more detailed explanations of how different typeface families convey distinct emotional qualities, and provide guidance on strategic font pairings.\n3. Incorporate interactive exercises or self-reflection prompts that allow learners to apply the color and typography principles to their own design projects or brand concepts.\n4. Expand the real-world examples to include more diverse applications across different industries and design specializations, ensuring relevance to the learners' interests and career aspirations.\n5. Optimize the content structure and formatting for asynchronous online delivery, utilizing clear headings, concise paragraphs, and ample visual aids to support independent learning.\n\nThe enhanced content should provide the target learners with a comprehensive understanding of how color, typography, and composition work together to create impactful graphic design, while also offering practical opportunities for them to apply these principles in their own work.",

  "response": "# Using Colour & Design to Shape Atmosphere\n\nImagine walking into two different cafés - one with warm amber lighting and rich burgundy walls, the other with stark fluorescent lighting and clinical white surfaces. Before you've even ordered, you've formed strong emotional impressions about each space.\n\nIn graphic design, these same principles apply to the visual spaces we create on screens and printed materials. Whether designing a website, brand identity, or marketing collateral, the strategic use of color creates an immediate emotional response that shapes how audiences perceive and interact with our work. Unlike interior design which shapes physical environments, graphic design uses these visual elements to craft experiences within the constraints of two-dimensional spaces, making color choices even more critical to establishing the right atmosphere.\n\n[IMAGE: Split-screen comparison of two café interiors with contrasting colour schemes and atmospheres]\n\nColour drives up to 90% of first impressions, with viewers forming emotional judgments in just 50 milliseconds—faster than conscious thought.\n\n[VISUAL: Colour wheel with emotional associations highlighted for primary and secondary colours]\n\nWhile you're already familiar with basic associations—reds energize, blues build trust, yellows suggest optimism—effective designers tailor colour strategies to specific audiences.\n\nFor corporate finance clients, navy combined with muted teal and grey creates an atmosphere of stability and trustworthiness.

Vibrant coral, sunshine yellow, and electric turquoise create energy and self-expression that resonates with younger audiences seeking authenticity and excitement.\n\n[VISUAL: Before/after makeover of a youth brand showing transformation from corporate feel to energetic atmosphere]\n\nThe most common mistake is choosing colours based on personal preference rather than audience psychology. Remember that your emotional response to a colour may differ significantly from your target audience's associations.\n\nWhile color establishes the emotional foundation of graphic design, typography serves as the voice that communicates your message. Just as we carefully select color palettes to evoke specific feelings, the typefaces we choose carry their own psychological weight and personality. In professional graphic design, these elements must work in harmony—a disconnect between your color atmosphere and typographic tone can create jarring experiences that confuse viewers and undermine your communication goals.\n\nTypography works as your design's emotional voice, with each typeface family carrying distinct psychological qualities.\n\n[VISUAL: Comparison of same message set in different typefaces with emotional attributes labeled]\n\nNotice how Helvetica Neue reads as authoritative and modern but somewhat cold, while Playfair Display communicates sophistication with less approachability.
