Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n   - You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n   - Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n   - Notice it yourself: After doing 10 jumping jacks, your body just used carbs to power that movement\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n   - Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n   - Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n   - Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n   - This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n   - When you exercise regularly and eat enough protein, your muscles gradually become stronger\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n   - Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n   - Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n   - Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n   - Your brain needs fats to work well\n   - We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n- Find 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or pictures of foods)\n- Group these items into \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n- For foods with multiple ingredients like pizza, decide which nutrient is most abundant\n- Use food labels or look online to check your answers\n- Many foods contain more than one nutrient - that's normal!\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  * 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  * 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  * After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  * 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  * 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  * 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  * Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  * Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  * Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  * Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  * Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Over to You \n- Test your knowledge: List 5 nutrient functions you learned today and check if they're correct\n- Create a \"My Performance Plate\" drawing showing what you would eat:\n  * Before your favourite physical activity\n  * After your favourite physical activity\n- Challenge yourself: Try one new performance-boosting food this week and write down how it made you feel\n- Good food choices help your body perform better in everything you do!",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Quality Assurance & Practical Implementation Review\n\nReview and refine educational content that has been transformed from classroom-based to online learning, ensuring practical effectiveness beyond technical compliance.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a critical assessment by identifying:\n1. Superficial transformations that merely shifted perspective without meaningful adaptation\n2. Self-directed instructions that remain impractical for independent learning\n3. Activities that still implicitly require a classroom, teacher, or group setting\n4. Assessment components that lack clear self-evaluation mechanisms\n5. Instances where the spirit of adaptation was not fulfilled despite technical compliance\n\n## CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. PRACTICAL ADAPTATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Convert superficial self-prompts to genuinely independent activities\n   - Replace \"ask yourself\" or \"give yourself prompts\" with concrete, actionable tasks\n   - Transform timed assessments to milestone-based progress measurements\n   - Provide specific success criteria for self-assessment\n   \n2. IMPLEMENTATION CLARITY (IMPORTANT):\n   - Add specific setup instructions for home-based learning environment\n   - Provide concrete alternatives for any specialized equipment\n   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common implementation challenges\n   - Clarify exactly how to perform and evaluate each activity independently\n   \n3. LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS (SUPPORTING):\n   - Ensure each activity reinforces specific learning objectives\n   - Add self-reflection components that guide deeper understanding\n   - Include examples of completed activities where helpful\n   - Provide multiple difficulty options for diverse learning needs\n\n## REVISION GUIDELINES:\n1. Maintain structural integrity while making practical adaptations\n2. Focus specifically on transforming content that merely \"shifted voice\" to the learner\n3. Replace any remaining classroom-dependent elements with truly independent alternatives\n4. Convert assessments from testing frameworks to learning reinforcement\n5. Preserve educational substance while ensuring practical effectiveness\n\nThis quality assurance review ensures the transformed content is genuinely effective for independent, asynchronous learning - not just technically compliant with transformation requirements.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the three main nutrients that power the body for physical activity - carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It explains the role and importance of each nutrient, and includes an activity for learners to practice identifying different nutrient groups in foods. The content also covers timing and composition of meals/snacks to fuel physical activity.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. PRACTICAL ADAPTATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Convert any remaining \"self-prompts\" or \"ask yourself\" instructions to concrete, actionable tasks\n   - Transform timed assessments into milestone-based progress measurements with clear success criteria\n   - Ensure all activities can be completed independently without requiring a teacher or group setting\n\n2. IMPLEMENTATION CLARITY (IMPORTANT): \n   - Add specific setup instructions for completing activities in a home-based learning environment\n   - Provide concrete alternatives for any specialized equipment mentioned\n   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common implementation challenges\n   - Clarify exactly how to perform and evaluate each activity independently\n\n3. LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS (SUPPORTING):\n   - Ensure each activity reinforces the specific learning objectives outlined\n   - Add self-reflection components that guide deeper understanding of nutrient functions\n   - Include examples of completed activities where helpful\n   - Provide multiple difficulty options for diverse learning needs\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Language and Readability: Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level, use everyday words, limit sentence length, write in active voice\n- Structure and Organization: Use frequent headings, numbered steps, bullet points, and visual breaks to create clear \"chunks\" of information\n- Visual Elements: Include relevant images, diagrams, labeled illustrations, and visual examples for each new concept\n- Engagement Strategies: Connect to real-world examples, use conversational tone, incorporate \"Stop and Think\" moments, and create achievable challenges\n- Equipment and Space Considerations: Provide alternatives using common household items, suggest adaptations for small spaces, and offer variations for different surfaces\n- Safety Guidelines: Clearly communicate safety warnings, proper form, and modification options for different physical abilities\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. All activities must be designed for independent completion without requiring a teacher or specialized equipment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the core educational value and learning objectives of the original content\n- Ensure practical effectiveness for independent, home-based learning beyond technical compliance\n- Convert any remaining classroom-dependent elements into truly independent alternatives\n- Transform assessments from testing frameworks into learning reinforcement opportunities\n- Preserve the original substance while enhancing the content's practical implementation\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify any remaining \"self-prompts\" or \"ask yourself\" instructions that should be converted to concrete, actionable tasks.\n2. Analyze the assessment components and transform them into milestone-based progress measurements with clear success criteria for independent self-evaluation.\n3. Add specific setup instructions, equipment alternatives, and troubleshooting guidance to enhance the content's practical implementation in a home-based learning environment.\n4. Incorporate self-reflection opportunities and multiple difficulty options to reinforce learning objectives and cater to diverse learner needs.\n5. Maintain the original educational substance while making targeted adaptations to ensure the content is genuinely effective for asynchronous, independent learning.",

Or what snack did you have before your last soccer practice or bike ride? Many athletes pay close attention to their food choices before big games. In this lesson, we'll explore how different foods give you energy and help build strength for all your daily activities.\n\n## The Three Main Nutrients\n1. Carbohydrates: Your Body's Quick Energy\n   - Carbs provide the energy your body uses first during activity\n   - You'll find them in bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables\n   - Your body turns carbs into glucose that powers your muscles\n   - Running low on carbs can leave you feeling tired during play\n   - Activity: Stand up and do 10 jumping jacks. Take a moment to notice how your breathing changes. Your body just used carbohydrates to power that movement.\n\n2. Proteins: The Muscle Builders\n   - Proteins repair and build your muscles after you use them\n   - Foods like chicken, eggs, beans, yogurt, and nuts contain protein\n   - Exercise creates small tears in muscles - protein helps fix them\n   - This repair makes your muscles stronger than before\n   - Activity: Gently squeeze your arm muscle. The firmness you feel is made of protein that helps your body move.\n\n3. Fats: Your Long-Lasting Energy Source\n   - Healthy fats provide energy that lasts through longer activities\n   - Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish contain healthy fats\n   - Fats cushion your organs and help your body use certain vitamins\n   - Your brain needs fats to work well\n   - We need fats in smaller amounts than carbs and protein\n\n## Activity: Nutrient Detectives\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items\n2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)\n3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings\n4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information\n\n### Activity Steps:\n1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them \"Mainly Carbs,\" \"Mainly Protein,\" and \"Mainly Fats\"\n2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in\n3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle\n4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)\n5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:\n   - Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)\n   - An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database\n   - A food guide chart (included below)\n\n### Example of Completed Activity:\n- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana\n- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt\n- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.\n- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.\n- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.\n\n## Fuelling Up for Activity\n\n- Timing matters! When to eat for best performance:\n  * 2-3 hours before: Larger meals with all three nutrients\n  * 30-60 minutes before: Small carb snack for quick energy\n  * After activity: Protein and carbs to help muscles recover\n- A \"Perfect Plate\" includes:\n  * 1/2 plate: Fruits and vegetables (carbs, vitamins, minerals)\n  * 1/4 plate: Grains or starchy vegetables (carbs)\n  * 1/4 plate: Protein foods\n  * Small amount: Healthy fats\n- Balanced meals and snacks you can make:\n  * Peanut butter and banana sandwich on whole grain bread\n  * Yoghurt parfait with fruit and granola\n  * Hummus with veggie sticks and pita bread\n  * Chocolate milk after a workout (contains both protein and carbs)\n\n## Knowledge Check and Application Activities\n\n### Knowledge Check Activity:\n1. On a piece of paper, create a three-column table with the headings \"Carbohydrates,\" \"Proteins,\" and \"Fats\"\n2. Under each heading, write at least 2 functions of that nutrient in your body\n3. List 3 food examples for each nutrient group\n4. Check your answers against the information in this lesson\n5. Success criteria: You should be able to identify at least 5 total nutrient functions correctly\n\n### My Performance Plate Activity:\n1. Materials needed: Paper, pencil, and coloring supplies (optional)\n2. Draw a circle to represent a plate\n3. Divide your plate according to the \"Perfect Plate\" guidelines above\n4. In each section, draw or write specific foods you would eat:\n   * Before your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"Before\")\n   * After your favorite physical activity (label this plate \"After\")\n5. For each plate, write why you chose those specific foods\n6. Success criteria: Your \"Before\" plate should include quick energy foods (mainly carbs), while your \"After\" plate should include recovery foods (protein and carbs)\n\n### Food Experiment (Optional Challenge):\n1. Choose one new performance-boosting food you haven't tried before\n2. Try eating this food before or after physical activity\n3. In a notebook, record:\n   * What food did you try?\n   * When did you eat it (before or after activity)?\n   * What physical activity did you do?\n   * How did you feel during/after the activity?\n   * Would you eat this food again before/after exercise? Why or why not?\n4. Success criteria: Complete the experiment and record your observations about how the food affected your energy or recovery\n\nRemember: Good food choices help your body perform better in everything you do! By understanding which nutrients your body needs and when, you can make smart choices to fuel your activities."
