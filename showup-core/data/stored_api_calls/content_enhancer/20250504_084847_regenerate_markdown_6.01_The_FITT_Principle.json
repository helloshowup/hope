They're likely using the FITT Principle. It's a simple way to create workouts that actually work for YOU - not just copying what others do.\n\n## What is the FITT Principle?\n\nThe FITT Principle breaks down exercise planning into four key parts:\n\n- **F**requency: How often you exercise (like 3 times a week)\n- **I**ntensity: How hard you work during exercise (easy, medium, or challenging)\n- **T**ime: How long each workout lasts (20 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.)\n- **T**ype: What kind of exercise you do (running, dancing, basketball, etc.)\n\nThese four elements work together to create your personal exercise plan. You can adjust each part to match what your body needs and what you want to achieve.\n\n## Exploring Each Part of FITT\n\n### Frequency\nFrequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:\n- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week\n- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover\n- You don't have to do the same thing every day\n- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting\n\n**Example:** You might play basketball on Monday and Wednesday, go for a bike ride on Friday, and take a walk around your neighborhood on Saturday.\n\n### Intensity\nIntensity means how hard your body is working. Here are some easy ways to gauge it:\n\n- **Talk Test**: If you can talk but not sing during your activity, that's medium intensity. If you can barely talk, that's high intensity.\n- **Scale of Effort**: On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is sitting still and 10 is running as fast as possible:\n  - 4-5 = medium intensity (you're working but can keep going)\n  - 7-8 = high intensity (challenging but not impossible)\n\n**Example:** When riding your bike, going up a hill might be a 7 (high), while cruising on flat ground might be a 4 (medium).\n\n### Time\nTime refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:\n- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day\n- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too\n- Shorter, more intense workouts can be just as good as longer, easier ones\n- As you get fitter, you can gradually increase your time\n\n**Example:** You might do a 15-minute workout video in the morning and play outside for 20 minutes in the afternoon.\n\n### Type\nType is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types, and a well-rounded fitness plan includes all of them:\n\n1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping\n   - Running, swimming, dancing, biking, jumping rope\n   - Strengthens your heart and lungs\n\n2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle\n   - Push-ups, squats, climbing, resistance bands\n   - Builds stronger muscles and bones\n\n3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles\n   - Yoga, stretching, martial arts\n   - Helps prevent injuries and keeps you moving well\n\n**Example:** In one week, you might jog around your yard (cardio), do a bodyweight workout (strength), and try some yoga (flexibility).\n\n## Creating Your Own FITT Plan\n\nReady to create your own FITT plan? Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set a goal**: What do you want to achieve? Maybe you want to:\n   - Get better at a specific sport\n   - Have more energy throughout the day\n   - Be able to run a mile without stopping\n   - Just have fun being active!\n\n2. **Choose your FITT components**:\n   - **Frequency**: How many days can you realistically exercise?\n   - **Intensity**: What level feels challenging but doable for you?\n   - **Time**: How long can you exercise in one session?\n   - **Type**: What activities do you enjoy most?\n\n3. **Create a weekly schedule**: Plan which days and times you'll exercise\n\n4. **Track your progress**: Keep a simple journal of what you do and how it feels\n\nRemember, the best exercise plan is one that you'll actually do! Choose activities you enjoy and start where you are - you can always adjust as you go.\n\n## Sample FITT Plans for Students\n\nHere are some example FITT plans to help you get started:\n\n**For Beginners:**\n- **Frequency**: 3 days per week\n- **Intensity**: Medium (4-5 out of 10)\n- **Time**: 20-30 minutes per session\n- **Type**: Walking, dancing to favourite music, following along with online exercise videos\n\n**For Sports Performance:**\n- **Frequency**: 4-5 days per week\n- **Intensity**: Mix of medium and high\n- **Time**: 30-45 minutes per session\n- **Type**: Sport-specific practice, interval training, strength exercises you can do at home\n\n**For Overall Fitness:**\n- **Frequency**: 5 days per week\n- **Intensity**: Varied (some easy days, some challenging days)\n- **Time**: 30-60 minutes per session\n- **Type**: Mix of cardio (jogging, jumping jacks), strength (bodyweight exercises), and flexibility (stretching)\n\n## Adjusting Your FITT Plan\n\nAs you follow your plan, you'll learn what works for you and what doesn't. Don't be afraid to make changes! Here's how:\n\n- If it feels too easy: Increase one component at a time (maybe add 5 minutes or try a more challenging activity)\n- If it feels too hard: Decrease one component (maybe reduce the intensity or time)\n- If you get bored: Try a new type of activity while keeping the other components the same\n- If you're not seeing results: Be patient! Results take time, but you might need to increase your intensity\n\nThe most important thing is to listen to your body and make exercise work for YOU.\n\nThe FITT Principle gives you the power to create your own personalised fitness plan. By understanding and adjusting the Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of your workouts, you can design an exercise routine that fits your schedule, matches your interests, and helps you reach your goals. Fitness isn't about being perfect - it's about discovering what your amazing body can do!\n\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Educational Content Quality Assurance & Practical Implementation Review\n\nReview and refine educational content that has been transformed from classroom-based to online learning, ensuring practical effectiveness beyond technical compliance.\n\n## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:\nFirst conduct a critical assessment by identifying:\n1. Superficial transformations that merely shifted perspective without meaningful adaptation\n2. Self-directed instructions that remain impractical for independent learning\n3. Activities that still implicitly require a classroom, teacher, or group setting\n4. Assessment components that lack clear self-evaluation mechanisms\n5. Instances where the spirit of adaptation was not fulfilled despite technical compliance\n\n## CORRECTION REQUIREMENTS (in priority order):\n1. PRACTICAL ADAPTATION (CRITICAL):\n   - Convert superficial self-prompts to genuinely independent activities\n   - Replace \"ask yourself\" or \"give yourself prompts\" with concrete, actionable tasks\n   - Transform timed assessments to milestone-based progress measurements\n   - Provide specific success criteria for self-assessment\n   \n2. IMPLEMENTATION CLARITY (IMPORTANT):\n   - Add specific setup instructions for home-based learning environment\n   - Provide concrete alternatives for any specialized equipment\n   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common implementation challenges\n   - Clarify exactly how to perform and evaluate each activity independently\n   \n3. LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS (SUPPORTING):\n   - Ensure each activity reinforces specific learning objectives\n   - Add self-reflection components that guide deeper understanding\n   - Include examples of completed activities where helpful\n   - Provide multiple difficulty options for diverse learning needs\n\n## REVISION GUIDELINES:\n1. Maintain structural integrity while making practical adaptations\n2. Focus specifically on transforming content that merely \"shifted voice\" to the learner\n3. Replace any remaining classroom-dependent elements with truly independent alternatives\n4. Convert assessments from testing frameworks to learning reinforcement\n5. Preserve educational substance while ensuring practical effectiveness\n\nThis quality assurance review ensures the transformed content is genuinely effective for independent, asynchronous learning - not just technically compliant with transformation requirements.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the FITT Principle, which is a framework for creating personalized exercise plans. It covers the four key components of the FITT Principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) and explains how to apply them to develop an effective fitness routine. The content also includes sample FITT plans for different goals and guidance on adjusting the plan as needed.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt focuses on transforming the content from a classroom-based to an asynchronous online learning experience. Key requirements include:\n\n1. PRACTICAL ADAPTATION:\n   - Convert self-prompts to independent activities\n   - Replace \"ask yourself\" or \"give yourself prompts\" with concrete, actionable tasks\n   - Transform timed assessments to milestone-based progress measurements\n   - Provide specific success criteria for self-assessment\n\n2. IMPLEMENTATION CLARITY:\n   - Add specific setup instructions for home-based learning environment\n   - Provide concrete alternatives for any specialized equipment\n   - Include troubleshooting guidance for common implementation challenges\n   - Clarify exactly how to perform and evaluate each activity independently\n\n3. LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS:\n   - Ensure each activity reinforces specific learning objectives\n   - Add self-reflection components that guide deeper understanding\n   - Include examples of completed activities where helpful\n   - Provide multiple difficulty options for diverse learning needs\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target audience is 11-14 year old students (grades 6-8) in an asynchronous online physical education course. Key considerations:\n\n- Reading level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Language: English-speaking students\n- Prior knowledge: Varying exposure to physical education concepts\n- Learning style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- Physical space/equipment: Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nContent should use everyday language, short sentences, active voice, and frequent visual aids. Provide clear instructions, safety guidelines, and adaptations for different home environments and equipment.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through an asynchronous online learning platform, with no peer interaction. This means the content must be self-contained, with all necessary information and guidance provided directly within the materials.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the core educational value and integrity of the FITT Principle framework\n- Transform content to be genuinely independent and practical for home-based learning\n- Ensure each activity and assessment component can be completed without a teacher or classroom setting\n- Provide clear, actionable steps and success criteria for self-evaluation\n- Incorporate visual aids, examples, and multiple difficulty levels to support diverse learners\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content and identify areas that require practical adaptation for independent learning.\n2. Convert any self-prompts or \"ask yourself\" questions into concrete, step-by-step instructions.\n3. Develop clear setup and implementation guidance for each activity, including alternatives for specialized equipment.\n4. Incorporate self-reflection components that guide learners to deeper understanding of the FITT Principle.\n5. Create multiple versions of activities and assessments with varying difficulty levels to accommodate diverse learning needs.\n6. Ensure all content is visually engaging, with ample use of images, diagrams, and examples to support comprehension.\n7. Thoroughly test the enhanced content to verify it can be effectively implemented by learners without a teacher or classroom setting.\n\nThe goal is to transform the current content into a genuinely practical, self-directed learning experience that maintains the educational value of the FITT Principle while adapting it for asynchronous online delivery.",

You can adjust each part to match what your body needs and what you want to achieve.\n\n## Setting Up Your Learning Space\n\nBefore we begin, let's set up your exercise learning space:\n\n1. **Find a clear area**: You'll need a space about the size of a bathroom rug where you can move freely without bumping into furniture\n2. **Equipment alternatives**:\n   - No weights? Use filled water bottles or canned food\n   - No exercise mat? Use a folded blanket or towel\n   - No jump rope? Pretend to hold one and jump in place\n3. **Safety check**:\n   - Make sure your floor isn't slippery\n   - Remove any objects you might trip over\n   - Have water nearby\n   - Wear comfortable clothes and supportive shoes\n\n## Exploring Each Part of FITT\n\n### Frequency\nFrequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:\n- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week\n- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover\n- You don't have to do the same thing every day\n- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting\n\n**Activity**: Look at your weekly schedule and mark specific days and times when you can exercise. For example:\n- Monday: 4:00-4:30 PM\n- Wednesday: 3:30-4:00 PM\n- Saturday: 10:00-10:30 AM\n\n### Intensity\nIntensity means how hard your body is working. Here are two ways to measure it on your own:\n\n- **Talk Test**: \n  1. During activity, try to say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing a verse of your favorite song\n  2. If you can talk comfortably = low intensity\n  3. If you can talk but not sing = medium intensity\n  4. If you can barely talk = high intensity\n\n- **Scale of Effort**: \n  1. During activity, rate your effort from 1-10\n  2. 1-3 = easy (like walking slowly)\n  3. 4-6 = medium (breathing harder but can continue)\n  4. 7-10 = hard (breathing very hard, can't continue long)\n\n**Activity**: Try these three exercises for 30 seconds each:\n1. Walking in place\n2. Jogging in place\n3. Jumping jacks\n\nAfter each one, immediately write down:\n- Your effort score (1-10)\n- Whether you could talk easily, with difficulty, or barely at all\n\n### Time\nTime refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:\n- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day\n- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too\n\n**Activity**: Use a timer (phone, clock, or kitchen timer) for these practice sessions:\n1. Do any movement (march in place, dance, etc.) for 1 minute\n2. Rest for 30 seconds\n3. Repeat 3 times\n\nHow did it feel? Was it too short, too long, or just right? Write this down in your fitness journal.\n\n### Type\nType is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types:\n\n1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping\n   - Examples you can do at home: Jogging in place, jumping jacks, dancing to music, climbing stairs\n\n2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle\n   - Examples with no equipment: Push-ups against a wall, squats, lunges, plank position\n\n3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles\n   - Examples: Reaching for your toes, arm circles, gentle twists\n\n**Activity**: Try one exercise from each category:\n1. Cardio: March in place for 30 seconds\n2. Strength: Do 5 wall push-ups (standing arms-length from wall, push against it)\n3. Flexibility: Reach arms overhead and gently lean side to side\n\nAfter each one, write down:\n- How it felt in your body\n- Which one you enjoyed most\n- Which one was most challenging\n\n## Creating Your Own FITT Plan\n\nNow let's create your own FITT plan with these specific steps:\n\n1. **Set a measurable goal**: Complete this sentence: \"In 4 weeks, I want to be able to ___________.\"\n   Examples:\n   - Run in place for 5 minutes without stopping\n   - Do 10 push-ups in a row\n   - Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight\n\n2. **Fill in your FITT plan worksheet**:\n\n   | Component | My Plan | Why I Chose This |\n   |-----------|---------|------------------|\n   | Frequency | ___ days per week | |\n   | Intensity | ___ out of 10 | |\n   | Time | ___ minutes per session | |\n   | Type | List specific activities: | |\n\n3. **Create a weekly schedule**: Write down exactly when you'll exercise each day:\n\n   | Day | Time | Activity | Location in Home |\n   |-----|------|----------|------------------|\n   | Monday | | | |\n   | Tuesday | | | |\n   | Wednesday | | | |\n   | Thursday | | | |\n   | Friday | | | |\n   | Saturday | | | |\n   | Sunday | | | |\n\n4. **Progress tracking**: After each workout, record:\n   - Date and time\n   - What you did\n   - How long you did it\n   - How it felt (1-10 scale)\n   - One thing you're proud of\n   - One thing to improve next time\n\n## Sample FITT Plans for Students\n\nHere are some example FITT plans with specific activities you can do at home:\n\n**For Beginners:**\n- **Frequency**: 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)\n- **Intensity**: Medium (4-5 out of 10)\n- **Time**: 20 minutes per session\n- **Type**: \n  - 5 minutes: Walking in place or around your home\n  - 5 minutes: Arm circles, wall push-ups, chair squats (sitting down and standing up)\n  - 5 minutes: Gentle stretching\n  - 5 minutes: Free dance to your favorite song\n\n**For Sports Performance:**\n- **Frequency**: 4 days per week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday)\n- **Intensity**: Mix of medium (5-6) and high (7-8)\n- **Time**: 30 minutes per session\n- **Type**: \n  - 5 minutes: Warm-up (jogging in place, arm swings)\n  - 15 minutes: Sport-specific movements (practice dribbling a ball, shooting technique, footwork patterns)\n  - 5 minutes: Strength (push-ups, squats, lunges)\n  - 5 minutes: Cool-down stretches\n\n**For Overall Fitness:**\n- **Frequency**: 5 days per week (Monday through Friday)\n- **Intensity**: Varied (see schedule)\n- **Time**: 30 minutes per session\n- **Type**: \n  - Monday: Cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks) - Intensity 7/10\n  - Tuesday: Strength (bodyweight exercises) - Intensity 6/10\n  - Wednesday: Light activity (walking, gentle stretching) - Intensity 3/10\n  - Thursday: Interval training (30 seconds hard, 30 seconds easy) - Intensity 8/10\n  - Friday: Flexibility (stretching routine) - Intensity 4/10\n\n## Troubleshooting Your FITT Plan\n\nHere are solutions for common challenges you might face:\n\n**If you don't have enough space:**\n- Focus on stationary exercises (planks, push-ups, squats)\n- Use a chair for step-ups instead of running\n- Try \"traveling\" exercises in a small path (2-3 steps forward and back)\n\n**If you don't have equipment:**\n- Books in a backpack = weights\n- A towel = resistance band (pull it tight between hands)\n- Stairs = cardio machine\n- Chair = workout bench\n\n**If you're not sure you're doing exercises correctly:**\n1. Take a photo or video of yourself\n2. Compare to example images provided\n3. Check these key points:\n   - Back straight, not rounded\n   - Knees aligned with toes, not caving inward\n   - Movements controlled, not rushed\n\n## Adjusting Your FITT Plan\n\nAfter following your plan for one week, use this self-assessment checklist:\n\n- [ ] I completed all my planned workout sessions\n- [ ] The intensity level felt appropriate (challenging but doable)\n- [ ] I had enough energy to complete each session\n- [ ] I enjoyed at least some of the activities\n- [ ] I'm seeing or feeling small improvements\n\nBased on your answers, here's how to adjust:\n\n**If it feels too easy** (you checked all boxes and felt you could do more):\n1. Keep frequency the same\n2. Increase just ONE of these:\n   - Intensity: Add 1-2 points to your target effort level\n   - Time: Add 5 minutes to your sessions\n   - Type: Try the more challenging version of an exercise (regular push-ups instead of wall push-ups)\n\n**If it feels too hard** (you couldn't check most boxes):\n1. Keep frequency the same\n2. Decrease just ONE of these:\n   - Intensity: Lower your target effort by 2-3 points\n   - Time: Reduce sessions by 5-10 minutes\n   - Type: Try the easier version of exercises (wall push-ups instead of regular)\n\n**If you get bored:**\n1. Keep your schedule and timing the same\n2. Swap activities for similar ones:\n   - Instead of jogging in place, try dancing\n   - Instead of regular push-ups, try them with hands in different positions\n   - Add music to your workout\n\n**Success indicators** - You'll know your plan is working when:\n- You can complete all sessions without excessive fatigue\n- Your breathing recovers faster after exercise\n- Movements that were once hard become easier\n- You look forward to (at least some) exercise sessions\n- You can do more repetitions or time than when you started\n\nRemember, the FITT Principle gives you the power to create your own personalized fitness plan. By understanding and adjusting the Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of your workouts, you can design an exercise routine that fits your schedule, matches your interests, and helps you reach your goals. Fitness isn't about being perfect - it's about discovering what your amazing body can do!"
