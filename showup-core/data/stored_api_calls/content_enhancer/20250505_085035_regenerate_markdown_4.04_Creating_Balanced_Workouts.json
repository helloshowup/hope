A good warm-up:\n- Raises your heart rate with light movement like jogging in place, jumping jacks, or dancing\n- Wakes up your muscles with arm circles, leg swings, and gentle twists\n- Gets your joints ready with ankle rotations and knee lifts\n- Takes about 3-5 minutes and involves your whole body\n\nSkipping warm-ups often leads to injuries. Those few minutes make the rest of your workout safer and more effective.\n\n**Warm-Up Activity**: Complete this 3-minute sequence to prepare your body:\n1. March in place for 30 seconds\n2. Do 10 arm circles forward and 10 backward\n3. Perform 10 knee lifts on each leg\n4. Do 10 ankle rotations on each foot\n5. Finish with 30 seconds of jumping jacks or marching in place\n\n## Strength Training\nStrength training builds muscle power and is essential for a balanced workout. Regular strength training improves posture, increases strength, and helps your body use energy better. Here are some exercises you can do without equipment:\n\n- Push-ups (regular or on your knees)\n- Squats (lowering your body as if sitting down)\n- Lunges (stepping forward with bent knees)\n- Plank holds (maintaining a straight body position)\n- Superman lifts (raising arms and legs while lying on your stomach)\n\nDo 2 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise. Rest 30-60 seconds between sets. \n\n**Exercise Modifications:**\n- If push-ups are too difficult: Do them against a wall or with knees on the floor\n- If squats hurt your knees: Don't go as deep or hold onto a chair for support\n- If balance is challenging during lunges: Keep one hand on a wall or chair\n- If plank is too hard: Hold the position for shorter time or use your knees\n- If Superman hurts your back: Lift just arms or just legs, not both together\n\n**Strength Training Activity**: Choose 3 exercises from the list. Perform 2 sets of each with appropriate rest. Record which version you did and how many repetitions you completed.\n\n## Flexibility\nStretching maintains healthy muscles and joints while improving everyday movement. When you stretch:\n- Hold each stretch 20-30 seconds without bouncing\n- Keep breathing deeply\n- Feel a gentle stretch, never pain\n\nTry these basic stretches:\n- Hamstring stretch (seated toe reach)\n- Quad stretch (standing, pulling foot toward buttocks)\n- Butterfly stretch (seated with feet together)\n- Shoulder stretch (arm across chest)\n- Child's pose (kneeling forward reach)\n\n**Troubleshooting Common Stretching Problems:**\n- If you can't reach your toes: Bend your knees slightly or reach for your shins instead\n- If you can't balance during standing stretches: Hold onto a wall or chair\n- If your muscles shake: Back off slightly until the shaking stops\n- If you feel pain (not just stretching): Stop and try a different stretch\n\n## Cool-Down\nA proper cool-down gradually returns your body to its resting state. Stopping exercise suddenly can make you dizzy or lightheaded. Your cool-down should include:\n- Slow walking or gentle marching\n- Deep breathing (inhale through nose, exhale through mouth)\n- Light stretching for tight muscles\n- A moment to check in with how your body feels\n\n**Cool-Down Activity**: After your workout, spend 3 minutes doing the following:\n1. Walk slowly in place for 1 minute\n2. Take 5 deep breaths while raising arms up and down\n3. Stretch any muscles that feel tight, holding each stretch for 20 seconds\n4. Stand still and notice how your body feels different from before the workout\n\n## Sample Workout for Beginners\nNow that you understand each component, here's a complete workout you can try at home:\n\n**Warm-Up (5 minutes)**\n- 1 minute: March in place\n- 1 minute: Arm circles (forward and backward)\n- 1 minute: High knees (lifting knees toward chest)\n- 1 minute: Leg swings (front to back, side to side)\n- 1 minute: Jumping jacks\n\n**Strength Training (10 minutes)**\n- 2 sets of 10 modified push-ups (rest 30 seconds between sets)\n- 2 sets of 12 squats (rest 30 seconds between sets)\n- 2 sets of 10 lunges (5 each leg, rest 30 seconds between sets)\n- 2 sets of 20-second plank holds (rest 30 seconds between sets)\n\n**Flexibility (5 minutes)**\n- Hamstring stretch (30 seconds each leg)\n- Quad stretch (30 seconds each leg)\n- Shoulder stretch (30 seconds each arm)\n- Lower back stretch (30 seconds)\n\n**Cool-Down (3 minutes)**\n- 1 minute: Slow walking in place\n- 1 minute: Deep breathing with arm raises\n- 1 minute: Gentle neck and shoulder rolls\n\n\n## Design Your Own Workout\nTaking what you've learned, it's time to create your own 15-minute workout. Follow these steps:\nINSERT FILE \n\n1. Choose 2-3 warm-up activities (total 3-5 minutes)\n2. Select 3 strength exercises (total 5-7 minutes)\n3. Pick 2-3 stretches for flexibility (total 3-5 minutes)\n4. Plan a 2-minute cool-down\n\n**Example of a Completed Workout Plan:**\n```\nMY 15-MINUTE WORKOUT\n\nWarm-Up (4 minutes):\n- Marching in place (1 minute)\n- Arm circles (1 minute)\n- Knee lifts (1 minute)\n- Jumping jacks (1 minute)\n\nStrength (7 minutes):\n- Push-ups against wall: 2 sets of 10\n- Squats holding onto chair: 2 sets of 12\n- Superman lifts (arms only): 2 sets of 10\n\nFlexibility (3 minutes):\n- Hamstring stretch (30 seconds each leg)\n- Shoulder stretch (30 seconds each arm)\n- Child's pose (30 seconds)\n\nCool-Down (2 minutes):\n- Walking in place (1 minute)\n- Deep breathing (1 minute)\n```\n\n**Your Turn**: Use the template to design your own 15-minute workout. Include all four components (warm-up, strength, flexibility, cool-down). If you need equipment alternatives, try:\n- Water bottles or canned food instead of weights\n- A sturdy chair for balance support\n- A towel instead of a yoga mat\n- Stairs for step-ups\n- A backpack with books for added resistance\n\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- A balanced workout includes four essential parts: warm-up to prepare your body, strength training to build muscles, flexibility work to maintain healthy joints, and cool-down to safely return to rest.\n- Tracking your progress with a workout log helps you see improvements and adjust difficulty by changing repetitions, rest periods, or exercise modifications.\n- You can create an effective 15-minute workout at home with minimal space and no special equipment by following a simple formula: 3-5 minutes of warm-up, 5-7 minutes of strength exercises, 3-5 minutes of stretching, and 2 minutes of cool-down.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n",
  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
