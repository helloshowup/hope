Knowing how to find and fix these issues is an essential skill for anyone working with robots.\n\nRobot systems can fail in many ways, but certain problems occur more frequently than others. Connection problems are among the most common - loose wires, disconnected sensors, or poor connections between components can cause a robot to behave strangely or not work at all.\n\nPower issues also frequently cause problems. Batteries might be low or dead, power switches might be off, or there might be a short circuit somewhere in the system. These issues often result in a robot that won't turn on, shuts down unexpectedly, or operates inconsistently.\n\nProgramming errors can cause robots to behave in unexpected ways. A small mistake in the code might make a robot move in the wrong direction, ignore sensor inputs, or get stuck in a loop of repeating the same action. You might notice symptoms like a robot that follows some commands but not others, or one that performs actions in the wrong order.\n\n## **Diagnostic Approaches**\n\nGood troubleshooting starts with careful observation. What exactly is the robot doing or not doing? When did the problem start? Does it happen all the time or only sometimes?\n\nAfter observation, a methodical approach works best. This often involves using a decision tree - a step-by-step process that helps narrow down possible causes. For example, if a robot won't move, you might first check if it's powered on, then check if the motors are connected, then test if the motors work individually, and so on.\n\nIsolation testing is another powerful technique. This involves testing one component at a time to find where the problem lies. For instance, if you suspect a sensor isn't working, you might write a simple program that just reads and displays that sensor's values to check if it's functioning correctly.\n\n## **Systematic Problem Solving**\n\nWhen facing a robot problem, follow these steps for efficient troubleshooting:\n\n1. Define the problem clearly - What should the robot be doing? What is it actually doing?\n2. Check the obvious - Is it turned on? Are batteries charged? Are there any visible disconnections?\n3. Divide and conquer - Break the system into parts (sensors, motors, processor, power) and test each part.\n4. Change one thing at a time - If you make multiple changes at once, you won't know which change fixed the problem.\n5. Document what you try - Keep track of what you've tested and the results so you don't repeat steps.\n\nFor example, if your line-following robot keeps losing the line, you might first check if the line sensor is positioned correctly, then test if the sensor can actually detect the line, then check if the motors respond to commands, and finally review your code to ensure it's correctly interpreting sensor data and sending appropriate commands to the motors.\n\nLet's look at a practical example: Imagine you built a robot that's supposed to follow a line on the floor, but it keeps spinning in circles instead. Here's how you might troubleshoot:\n\n1. Define the problem: Robot should follow a line but spins in circles instead\n2. Check the obvious: Batteries are charged, robot is turned on, line is clearly visible\n3. Divide and conquer: Test each sensor by placing it over the line and checking if the light changes\n4. You discover one sensor always reads \"dark\" no matter what surface it's over\n5. Fix the sensor connection and test again - now the robot follows the line correctly!\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nA robot is not responding to touch sensor input. Which troubleshooting step would be MOST logical to try first?\n\nA. Immediately replace the robot's processing unit\n\nB. Check the physical connection between the sensor and the controller\n\nC. Reprogram the entire robot with new software\n\nD. Increase the power supply to all systems\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Check the physical connection between the sensor and the controller. When troubleshooting, it's best to start with the simplest and most common causes before moving to more complex or expensive solutions. Checking physical connections is a quick, non-destructive first step that addresses a frequent issue. If you chose a different answer, remember that troubleshooting should progress from simple to complex solutions, checking each component methodically.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Robot problems usually come from loose wires, dead batteries, or code mistakes - each showing different symptoms you can learn to spot.\n- Successful troubleshooters carefully observe the problem, then test one part at a time to find what's broken.\n- Follow five simple steps when fixing robots: identify the problem, check obvious things first, test each part, change one thing at a time, and track what you've tried.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n## **Activity 2: Troubleshooting Scenarios**\n\nWork through the provided troubleshooting scenarios where robot systems are exhibiting various malfunctions. For each scenario, apply the systematic troubleshooting approach learned in this lesson to identify the most likely cause of the problem.

Batteries might be low or dead, power switches might be off, or there might be a short circuit somewhere in the system. These issues often mean a robot won't turn on, suddenly shuts down, or works sometimes but not always.\n\nMistakes in the programming can make robots behave in weird ways. A small error in the code might make a robot move in the wrong direction, ignore its sensors, or get stuck doing the same action over and over. You might notice your robot follows some commands but not others, or does things in the wrong order.\n\n## **Diagnostic Approaches**\n\nGood troubleshooting starts with watching carefully. What exactly is the robot doing or not doing? When did the problem start? Does it happen all the time or just sometimes?\n\nAfter watching, it's best to follow a step-by-step approach. This often means using a decision tree - a series of questions that helps narrow down what might be causing the problem. For example, if a robot won't move, you might first check if it's turned on, then check if the motors are connected, then test if each motor works by itself, and so on.\n\nTesting one part at a time is another great way to find problems. This is called isolation testing. For instance, if you think a sensor isn't working, you could write a simple program that just reads and shows that sensor's values to see if it's working right.\n\n## **Systematic Problem Solving**\n\nWhen your robot has a problem, follow these steps to find and fix it:\n\n1. Define the problem clearly - What should the robot be doing? What is it actually doing?\n2. Check the obvious - Is it turned on? Are batteries charged? Can you see any disconnected wires?\n3. Divide and conquer - Test each part separately (sensors, motors, brain, power) to find what's not working.\n4. Change one thing at a time - If you fix multiple things at once, you won't know which fix actually solved the problem.\n5. Write down what you try - Keep track of what you've tested so you don't repeat steps.\n\nHere's an example: If your line-following robot keeps losing the line, you might first check if the line sensor is in the right position, then test if the sensor can actually see the line, then check if the motors respond to commands, and finally look at your code to make sure it's correctly using the sensor information.\n\nLet's look at a real example: Imagine you built a robot that's supposed to follow a line on the floor, but it keeps spinning in circles instead. Here's how you might solve it:\n\n1. Define the problem: Robot should follow a line but spins in circles instead\n2. Check the obvious: Batteries are charged, robot is turned on, line is easy to see\n3. Divide and conquer: Test each sensor by putting it over the line and seeing if it detects light changes\n4. You discover one sensor always reads \"dark\" no matter what it's looking at\n5. Fix the sensor connection and test again - now the robot follows the line correctly!\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nA robot is not responding to touch sensor input.
