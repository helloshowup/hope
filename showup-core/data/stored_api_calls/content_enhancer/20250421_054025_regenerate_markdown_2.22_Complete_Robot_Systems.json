All parts must be in the right place to work properly. Sensors need to be where they can \"see\" what they're measuring. Motors must connect to the parts they need to move. Wires have to reach between all connected parts.\n\nElectrical integration means creating proper circuits that give the right amount of power to each part. This includes connecting batteries to controllers, and controllers to other parts. Wires must be neat and organized to avoid tangles or shorts. For example, a robot arm needs motors at each joint, with wires carefully routed along the arm so they don't get caught when the arm moves.\n\n### **Software and Hardware Interaction**\n\nThe software (the programs) and hardware (the physical parts) of a robot must work together perfectly. The software must be written specifically for the exact hardware being used - different motors, sensors, and controllers need different programming.\n\nWhen you write code for a robot, you need to know exactly what signals will make each part respond correctly. For example, a simple command like \"move forward\" in your program sends specific electrical signals to the motors. If the software doesn't match what the hardware can do, the robot might move too fast, too slow, or not move at all. It's like having the right key (software) for a specific lock (hardware).\n\n### **System Testing and Validation**\n\nBefore a robot is ready to use, we need to test it thoroughly to make sure all systems work together. Testing usually follows these steps:\n1. Test individual parts (each sensor, motor, etc.)\n2. Test groups of parts working together (like the whole movement system)\n3. Test the complete robot as one system\n\nValidation means checking that the robot does what it was designed to do. Can it move as expected? Does it detect obstacles? Can it complete its tasks? Engineers often use checklists and specific tests for each function. For example, a line-following robot might be tested on different colored floors, at different speeds, and with various line patterns to make sure it works in all situations.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you had to fix something that wasn't working right (like a game, toy, or device). What steps did you take to find and fix the problem? How could you use those same steps to fix problems in a robot?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- A robot needs its parts arranged correctly with organized wiring to function properly, like sensors having clear access to what they're sensing and motors connecting to the parts they need to move.\n- Software (programs) and hardware (physical parts) must match perfectly in a robot - just like having the right key for a specific lock - or the robot won't work as expected.\n- Engineers test robots step by step: first checking individual parts, then testing groups of parts working together, and finally making sure the complete robot performs all its required tasks.\n---keytakeawaysEND---",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
