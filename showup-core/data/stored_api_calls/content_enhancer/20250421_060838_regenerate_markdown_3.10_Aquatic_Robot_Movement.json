Some look like small boats with propellers or paddle wheels that push them forward. These are good for monitoring water quality in lakes or carrying sensors to collect weather data.\n\nOther surface robots use a fascinating property of water called **surface tension** â€“ the same force that lets some insects walk on water. These lightweight robots can skitter across the water's surface without sinking. Some even use solar panels to power themselves, allowing them to work for weeks or months without needing to recharge.\n\nSome of the most interesting surface swimmers are **wave gliders** that use the motion of waves to move forward without motors. They have underwater \"wings\" that capture wave energy, making them extremely energy-efficient for long missions like ocean monitoring or tracking whale migrations.\n\nIn real-world applications, surface swimming robots are already helping scientists study ocean health. The Liquid Robotics Wave Glider, for example, has traveled thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean collecting data about water temperature, pollution levels, and marine life. These robots can go places that would be too expensive or dangerous to send research ships, helping us learn more about our oceans while using very little energy.\n\n### **Underwater Propulsion Methods**\n\nUnderwater robots, often called **submersibles** or **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)**, face different challenges than their surface cousins. Water is much denser than air, which makes movement harder but also provides buoyancy that can help with floating.\n\nMany underwater robots use propellers similar to submarines or boats, but they need to be sealed against water pressure and protected from corrosion. Some deep-sea robots can withstand the crushing pressure of ocean depths greater than 20,000 feet below the surface!\n\n**Biomimetic** (nature-imitating) underwater robots copy the movement of sea creatures. Some wiggle like fish, using a flexible tail fin to push through water efficiently. Others pulse like jellyfish or use multiple small fins like cuttlefish. These designs are often quieter and gentler than propeller systems, making them perfect for studying sensitive marine environments like coral reefs without disturbing wildlife.\n\nThe latest underwater robots combine multiple sensors with their specialized movement systems. For example, the robot fish \"SoFi\" developed by MIT uses cameras to see underwater while its flexible tail helps it swim naturally among real fish. Its movements are so life-like that real fish don't swim away when it approaches, allowing scientists to study marine life up close without disturbing natural behaviors.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** How might flying robots change our world in the next ten years? What benefits and challenges might they bring?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Water robots come in two main types: surface swimmers that move on top of water using propellers or wave energy, and underwater robots that use propellers or mimic sea creatures to move beneath the surface.\n- Wave gliders are special robots that capture ocean wave energy to move forward without motors, making them energy-efficient for long missions like tracking whale migrations or monitoring ocean health.\n- Water robots help scientists study oceans and marine life by reaching places too dangerous or expensive for humans, with some deep-sea robots able to withstand pressure at depths greater than 20,000 feet.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n\nYour edits should be surgical and minimally invasive, preserving the original content while adding only the required formatting markers where needed.\n\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of two main types of water robots - surface swimmers and underwater robots. It covers the key features, movement mechanisms, and real-world applications of these aquatic robots. The content aims to educate the learner on the capabilities and uses of water-based robotics.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requires the following specific formatting changes to the educational content:\n\n1. Add bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n2. Ensure proper paragraph breaks with exactly one empty line between paragraphs.\n3. Do not alter any existing content or structure beyond the specified formatting changes.\n4. Preserve the logical flow and organization of the original material.\n5. Apply all transformations harmoniously without conflicting with each other.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are middle school students aged 11-14 years old, with varying exposure to STEM concepts and potentially their first formal introduction to robotics. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Use 5th-6th grade reading level language and sentence structure.\n- Explain technical terms clearly and simply when first introduced.\n- Incorporate visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations to support understanding.\n- Connect concepts to real-world examples familiar to the age group.\n- Maintain a conversational, friendly tone to engage the learners.\n- Provide opportunities for active processing, such as \"Stop and Think\" moments.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the formatting and structure must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without instructor guidance. Key considerations include:\n\n- Ensure clear section organization with frequent headings and subheadings.\n- Use bullet points, call-out boxes, and other visual breaks to create \"chunked\" information.\n- Incorporate multimedia elements like images and diagrams to support the written content.\n- Avoid excessive formatting or structural changes that could disrupt the original flow.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content.\n- Preserve the original structure, organization, and logical flow.\n- Ensure all formatting changes are applied consistently and harmoniously.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to the target learner profile.\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content to identify key themes, concepts, and structure.\n2. Extract the specific formatting requirements from the enhancement prompt.\n3. Analyze the target learner profile to determine appropriate language, visuals, and engagement strategies.\n4. Apply the required formatting changes, such as bolding key terms, while ensuring consistency and preserving the original intent.\n5. Organize the content into clear, concise sections with appropriate headings, subheadings, and paragraph breaks.\n6. Incorporate visual elements like images, diagrams, and call-out boxes to support the written content and enhance the learning experience.\n7. Review the enhanced content to verify that all transformations have been applied correctly and that the overall structure and flow remain intact.\n\nThe goal is to create a polished, learner-centric educational resource that maintains the original value while addressing the specific formatting requirements and target audience needs.",
