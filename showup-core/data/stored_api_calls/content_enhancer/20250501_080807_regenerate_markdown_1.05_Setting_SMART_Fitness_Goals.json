  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",

SMART goals are your secret weapon for turning fitness wishes into actual plans you can follow. They're a brilliant way to take charge of your health and fitness journey—and they work for all sorts of activities you enjoy!\n\n## What Are SMART Fitness Goals?\n\nWhen we talk about fitness goals, it's easy to say things like \"I want to get in shape\" or \"I want to be better at sports.\" But these big ideas don't give us a clear path forward. That's where SMART goals come in! They break down our dreams into steps we can actually follow.\n\nThink of SMART goals like a map for a treasure hunt. Without specific directions, you might wander around forever. But with clear instructions about where to go and how to recognize when you've found what you're looking for, you have a much better chance of success. Let's look at what each letter in SMART actually means for your fitness journey.\n\n**S - Specific**: Your goal should clearly state exactly what you want to do.\n*Instead of: \"I want to get better at running.\"*\n*Try: \"I want to run a full mile without stopping.\"*\n\n**M - Measurable**: Your goal needs a way to track your progress.\n*Instead of: \"I want to get stronger.\"*\n*Try: \"I want to do 15 push-ups in a row.\"*\n\n**A - Achievable**: Your goal should be challenging but possible for you right now.\n*Instead of: \"I'll do 100 sit-ups tomorrow.\"*\n*Try: \"I'll work up to doing 25 sit-ups by practising a little more each week.\"*\n\n**R - Relevant**: Your goal should matter to YOU and connect to activities you enjoy.\n*Instead of: \"I should join the swim team because my friend did.\"*\n*Try: \"I want to improve my basketball skills because I love playing with my friends.\"*\n\n**T - Time-bound**: Your goal needs a deadline to help you stay on track.\n*Instead of: \"Someday I'll be more flexible.\"*\n*Try: \"I will be able to touch my toes by the end of this month.\"*\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you wanted to get better at something - maybe a video game, a hobby, or a school subject.

The great thing about SMART goals is that they can be customized for anyone - whether you're just starting to get active or you've been playing sports for years. Everyone's starting point is different, and that's perfectly okay!\n\nWhen I was in middle school, my PE teacher helped our class set fitness goals at the beginning of each quarter. Some students wanted to make the basketball team, others wanted to run faster, and some just wanted to feel more comfortable in PE class. No matter what the goal was, using the SMART format helped everyone create a plan that made sense for them. Here are some examples that might inspire your own goal-setting:\n\n- \"I will run a mile without stopping by the end of this term.\"\n- \"I will do 10 proper push-ups in a row by winter break.\"\n- \"I will stretch for 10 minutes after school three days a week for the next month.\"\n- \"I will try a new physical activity (like skating or hiking) twice this month.\"\n- \"I will drink at least 6 cups of water every day this week.\"\n\n## Creating Your Own SMART Fitness Goals\nNow it's your turn! Follow these steps to create your own SMART fitness goal:\n\n1. Think about what physical activities you enjoy and what you'd like to improve.\n2. Choose one specific thing you want to accomplish.\n3. Make sure you can measure your progress somehow.\n4. Be honest about what's achievable for you right now.\n5.
