While traditional visual systems were designed for fixed media like print and posters, today's motion graphics must function across multiple platforms simultaneously. This fundamental shift requires designers to rethink how visual elements behave when they're set in motion and made interactive.\n\n[IMAGE: Side-by-side comparison showing the same brand identity in static print form versus its dynamic motion graphics application]\n\nMotion graphics systems differ from traditional design in three critical ways. First, they've evolved from fixed to responsive—adapting fluidly to various screen sizes rather than maintaining rigid dimensions. Second, they've shifted from passive to interactive, creating two-way communication with users. Third, they must be contextual, adapting to different environments and user preferences.\n\n[VISUAL: Demonstration of a logo adapting across different screen sizes and contexts]\n\nWhen translating visual systems to motion, we must consider multiple states that don't exist in static design. These include default states (how elements initially appear), active states (how they respond to interaction), and transitional states (how they move between conditions). Each state requires careful consideration of how your visual elements maintain brand consistency while embracing movement.\n\nThe BBC exemplifies this approach with their digital identity, which maintains consistent brand elements while adapting across platforms—from mobile apps to interactive TV interfaces—each requiring different interpretations of the same visual language in motion.\n\n[VISUAL: BBC identity showing consistent elements across different platforms with varying motion treatments]\n\nTypography transforms significantly in motion graphics contexts.

Digital screens emit rather than reflect light, changing how colours appear and interact. Some interfaces now use dynamic colour that changes based on time of day or user behaviour. When designing motion systems, you'll need higher contrast ratios than in print to ensure accessibility across viewing conditions.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, your motion graphics must now accommodate micro-interactions, transitions between states, and movement that conveys brand personality.

  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides an overview of the fundamental shifts in design from static to dynamic environments, focusing on the key considerations for translating visual systems into motion graphics. It covers how motion graphics differ from traditional design in terms of responsiveness, interactivity, and contextual adaptation. The content also explores specific design elements like typography, colour, and micro-interactions that require special attention when designing for motion.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe primary enhancement required is to carefully check the text and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt. This includes changes such as '-our' instead of '-or', '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze', '-re' instead of '-er', and various other British spelling conventions. No other changes to the content, structure, or formatting are permitted.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students preparing for professional careers. They have foundational knowledge but are now developing specialized skills and industry-ready capabilities. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Adapting language and examples to be appropriate for their level of expertise and industry focus\n- Ensuring content is accessible and engaging for both in-person and fully online learning environments\n- Emphasizing practical, hands-on applications and interactive elements to support their learning preferences\n- Maintaining a professional, career-oriented tone to align with their motivations and goals\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of in-person sessions and online learning platforms, with learners accessing all materials exclusively through digital means. This requires the content to be optimized for asynchronous online learning, with a strong emphasis on visual aids, interactive elements, and self-directed learning support.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and technical accuracy of the content\n- Preserve the core purpose, structure, and value of the original material\n- Ensure the language, examples, and level of complexity are appropriate for the target learners\n- Optimize the content for effective delivery through the specified online learning medium\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the text and make only the necessary changes to correct non-British spellings, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n2. Ensure all technical terms with standard spellings are preserved as-is.\n3. Pay close attention to the specific spelling conventions outlined, such as '-our' instead of '-or', '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze', and others.\n4. Maintain the original formatting, layout, and punctuation throughout the content.\n5. Consider opportunities to enhance the visual aids, interactive elements, and self-directed learning support to better suit the target learners' preferences and the online delivery medium.\n6. Avoid any other changes to the core content, structure, or intent beyond the required spelling corrections.\n\nThe goal is to enhance the content by addressing the specific British English spelling requirements while preserving the educational value and ensuring appropriate adaptation for the target learners and learning medium.",
