  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a robotics glossary for middle school students, covering a range of key terms and concepts related to robotics and automation. The glossary entries provide definitions, examples, and visual recommendations for each term.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\n1. Convert the current JSON data into a clean, structured markdown format.\n2. Transform each entry into a header section with the term as an H2 heading (##).\n3. Sort all entries alphabetically by term and remove any duplicate entries.\n4. For each entry, display the definition, example, and pronunciation (when available) on separate lines with appropriate bolding.\n5. Include the pronunciation in quotes if present, otherwise omit that field entirely.\n6. Format the definition and example with \"Definition:\" and \"Example:\" as bold prefixes followed by two spaces before their content.\n7. Ignore the \"visual_recommendation\" and \"difficulty_level\" fields completely.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- Age Range: 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- Reading Level: 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- Prior Knowledge: Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- Learning Style: Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use everyday language familiar to 11-12 year olds, with short sentences, active voice, and direct instructions. Jargon should be avoided or defined immediately. The structure should be clear and visually engaging, with frequent headings, bullet points, and relevant images.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's online curriculum, which is asynchronous and does not involve peer interaction. The formatting and organization should be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without the support of an instructor.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain educational integrity and preserve the original content's core value.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to the target learner profile.\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online learning medium.\n- Ensure the enhanced content is visually engaging and easy to navigate.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Sort the entries alphabetically and remove any duplicates.\n2. Transform each entry into a header section with the term as an H2 heading (##).\n3. For each entry, display the definition, example, and pronunciation (if available) on separate lines with appropriate bolding.\n4. Format the definition and example with \"Definition:\" and \"Example:\" as bold prefixes followed by two spaces before their content.\n5. Omit the \"visual_recommendation\" and \"difficulty_level\" fields.\n6. Ensure the content is written at a 5th-6th grade reading level, using simple language, short sentences, and active voice.\n7. Incorporate relevant images, diagrams, and visual elements to support the concepts and make the content more engaging for the target learners.\n8. Organize the content with clear headings, subheadings, and visual breaks to create a structured, easy-to-navigate learning experience.",
