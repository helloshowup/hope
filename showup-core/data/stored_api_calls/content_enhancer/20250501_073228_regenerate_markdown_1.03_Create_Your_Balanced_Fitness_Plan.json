Remember, a good fitness routine includes activities that work on all the components of fitness we tested. Here's a sample weekly plan:\n\n**Monday**: 20 minutes of running or biking (cardiovascular endurance)\n**Tuesday**: Push-ups and sit-ups (muscular strength and endurance)\n**Wednesday**: Yoga or stretching (flexibility)\n**Thursday**: Team sports like basketball or football (combines multiple components)\n**Friday**: Circuit training with different exercises (works all components)\n**Weekend**: Active fun like hiking, swimming, or dancing!\n\nRemember: Find activities you actually enjoy! When exercise is fun, you'll stick with it and see better results.\n\n## Track Your Progress\nBuilding on the baseline measurements you took in the fitness tests, you can now keep a fitness journal to see how you're improving:\n1. Write down your initial test results from the previous lesson\n2. Set realistic goals for improvement\n3. Record your activities each week\n4. Retest yourself every month\n5. Celebrate when you make progress!",

A good fitness routine includes activities that work on all the components of fitness we tested.\n\n### What Makes a Balanced Plan?\n\nA balanced fitness plan should include activities that improve:\n- Cardiovascular endurance (activities that make your heart beat faster)\n- Muscular strength (exercises that make your muscles stronger)\n- Muscular endurance (exercises that help your muscles work longer)\n- Flexibility (stretches that help you bend and reach farther)\n- Body composition (a mix of activities that help build muscle and burn calories)\n\n## Fun Fitness Activities to Try\n\nHere are some activities you might enjoy for each fitness component:\n\n**Cardiovascular Endurance:**\n- Walking or jogging around your neighborhood\n- Riding your bike\n- Dancing to your favorite songs\n- Jump rope challenges\n- Playing tag with friends or siblings\n\n**Muscular Strength and Endurance:**\n- Push-ups (try them against a wall if regular ones are too hard)\n- Sit-ups or crunches\n- Squats (like sitting in an invisible chair)\n- Plank holds (start with 10 seconds and build up)\n- Carrying groceries or books\n\n**Flexibility:**\n- Simple yoga poses\n- Morning stretches\n- Toe touches\n- Arm circles\n- Side bends\n\n**Fun Combination Activities:**\n- Playing basketball, soccer, or other sports\n- Swimming\n- Obstacle courses in your backyard\n- Fitness video games\n- Hiking with family\n\n## Creating Your Weekly Plan\n\nUse the \"My Weekly Fitness Plan\" template to schedule your activities. Try to include:\n- At least 3 days of cardiovascular activities\n- 2-3 days of strength exercises\n- Flexibility exercises most days\n- Rest days when your body feels tired\n\nRemember: Choose activities you actually enjoy! When exercise is fun, you'll stick with it and see better results.\n\n## Tracking Your Progress\n\nNow you can use the templates to keep track of how you're doing:\n\n1. Fill out the \"My Weekly Fitness Plan\" chart each week\n   - Write down what activities you did\n   - How long you did them\n   - How you felt (score 1-10)\n   - Any notes about the activity\n\n2. Use the \"My Fitness Components Tracker\" to:\n   - List which activities you'll do for each fitness component\n   - Set weekly and monthly goals for yourself\n\n3. Complete the \"Monthly Progress Check\" to see your improvements:\n   - Record your starting scores from the fitness tests\n   - Retest yourself each month\n   - Watch your numbers improve over time!\n\n## Safety Tips\n\n- Always warm up before exercising (try 5 minutes of walking or light movement)\n- Drink water before, during, and after activities\n- Stop if something hurts (not just feels challenging)\n- Ask a parent or adult for help if you're not sure how to do an exercise\n\n## Let's Get Moving!\n\nStart by filling out your plan for this week. Remember that any movement is better than none, and it's okay to start small. The most important thing is to have fun while getting fit!"
