When you actually look forward to shooting hoops or dancing, you'll keep at it without anyone pushing you.\n\n### Activity: Motivation Sorting\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points.

Have a water bottle nearby\n4. If possible, use a mat, towel, or carpet for floor exercises\n\n### Activity: Weekly Exercise Plan\nCreate a simple exercise plan for one week using this template:\n\n| Day | Activity | Time | Location in Home |\n|-----|----------|------|------------------|\n| Monday | | | |\n| Tuesday | | | |\n| Wednesday | | | |\n| Thursday | | | |\n| Friday | | | |\n| Saturday | | | |\n| Sunday | | | |\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.

  "instructions": "You are a specialized content generator working with a markdown document that contains embedded content generation instructions. These instructions are clearly marked with the delimiters %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour primary task:\n1. Process the document sequentially, identifying all properly formatted instruction blocks\n2. For each valid instruction block:\n   - Thoroughly analyze the requested content specifications\n   - Generate content that precisely fulfills these specifications\n   - Replace ONLY the instruction block (including delimiters) with your generated content\n   - Ensure seamless integration with surrounding text\n\nIMPORTANT - PRESERVED MARKERS:\nThe document contains special marker tags that MUST be preserved exactly as they appear:\n- ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---\n- ---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n- ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---\nThese markers serve specific pedagogical functions in the document and are NOT instruction blocks for you to replace. Always leave these markers completely intact.\n\nEXAMPLE OF CONTENT REPLACEMENT:\nConsider this example extract:\n\nOriginal text with instruction block:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% \n[Add a linking paragraph so that it doesn't read like ai writing. remember this is suppose to be read]\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nProper response after processing:\n```\nLearning to code requires practice and attention to detail.\n\nAs you progress in your coding journey, you'll find yourself moving from basic syntax to more complex logical structures. This transition often reveals patterns in problem-solving that extend beyond mere code writing into the realm of computational thinking.\n\nWhen creating algorithms and programming sequences, several common errors can occur:\n\nUnderstanding these errors helps troubleshoot more efficiently.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The entire instruction block (including delimiters and the instruction in brackets) was replaced\n- The generated content creates a natural bridge between the existing paragraphs\n- The writing style matches the instructional tone of the document\n- No trace of the instruction itself remains in the final text\n\nContent generation guidelines:\n- Maintain consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding document\n- Preserve all terminology and naming conventions established in the document\n- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs before and after your insertions\n- Adapt formatting to match the document's established patterns\n\nCritical requirements:\n- Do NOT modify ANY text outside the instruction blocks\n- Do NOT add commentary about the instructions or your generation process\n- Do NOT create new instruction blocks or modify existing delimiter syntax\n- If an instruction is unclear or contradictory, interpret it in the way that best serves the document's apparent purpose\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter nested or malformed instruction blocks, process only the outermost valid block\n- If an instruction seems impossible to fulfill based on the context, provide the closest reasonable approximation\n\nThe final document should appear as a cohesive whole with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process, while preserving all special marker tags intact.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational module on staying motivated to be physically active. It covers key concepts around internal vs. external motivation, building sustainable exercise habits, and tracking progress. The module includes several hands-on activities to help learners apply the concepts.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe primary objectives for enhancing this content are to:\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the material\n2. Address the specific needs outlined in the enhancement prompt, including:\n   - Generating content to fill in all properly formatted instruction blocks\n   - Ensuring seamless integration of the generated content with the surrounding text\n   - Preserving all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, etc.)\n3. Optimize the content for the target learner profile and learning medium\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to physical education concepts, possibly limited formal PE instruction\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Physical Space/Equipment:** Limited access to specialized equipment, varying home spaces available\n\nThe content should use everyday language, short sentences, active voice, and clear instructions starting with action verbs. Incorporate frequent visual elements like images, diagrams, and labeled illustrations to support understanding. Provide alternatives using common household items and adaptations for small spaces to accommodate the learners' environments.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is intended for asynchronous online delivery through Excel Middle School's curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the material must be self-contained, with all necessary information and instructions provided directly within the text. Formatting should be optimized for easy scanning and comprehension on a digital screen.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the original content's educational integrity, core value, and pedagogical structure\n- Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt, including generating content to fill instruction blocks\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level of the target learners\n- Incorporate visual elements, hands-on activities, and real-world connections to engage the middle school audience\n- Provide alternatives and adaptations to accommodate the learners' limited access to specialized equipment and varying home environments\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Thoroughly analyze each instruction block to understand the requested content and how it fits within the overall document.\n2. Generate content that precisely fulfills the specifications of the instruction, maintaining consistent tone, style, and technical depth with the surrounding material.\n3. Replace only the instruction block (including delimiters) with the generated content, ensuring a seamless transition before and after the insertion.\n4. Preserve all special marker tags (---stopandreflect---, ---checkyourunderstanding---, etc.) exactly as they appear in the original document.\n5. Review the final enhanced content to verify it reads as a cohesive whole, with no trace of the instruction blocks or generation process.\n\nThe goal is to create a polished, learner-centered educational experience that fulfills the enhancement prompt while adhering to the target learner profile and learning medium constraints.",
