Think of algorithms as recipes: they tell you exactly what to do and in what order to achieve a specific result.\n\nIn programming, algorithms are the foundation of how computers process information. Robots and computers don't understand vague instructions—they need precise, ordered steps to follow.\n### **Real-World Algorithms**\n\nAlgorithms are all around us! When you tie your shoes, brush your teeth, or make a sandwich, you're following an algorithm. These everyday sequences help us understand how computers process instructions:\n1. **Brushing teeth algorithm**:\n   - Wet toothbrush\n   - Apply toothpaste\n   - Brush all surfaces of teeth\n   - Rinse mouth\n   - Rinse toothbrush\n   - Rinse mouth\nEven video games use algorithms to determine how characters move or react to player actions. For example:\n- In a racing game, an algorithm calculates when your car should slow down on curves\n- School security systems use algorithms to decide when to lock doors or sound alarms\n- Music apps use algorithms to suggest songs you might like based on what you've listened to before\n- Traffic lights use algorithms to control the timing of red, yellow, and green signals to manage traffic flow\n\n## **Activity 1: Decomposing a Daily Routine**\n\nChoose a simple daily task like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or tying shoelaces. Write down every single step required to complete the task, being as precise as possible. Try to be so detailed that someone who has never done this task before could follow your instructions perfectly. Share your steps with a friend or family member and see if they can follow them exactly without any additional information.\n## **Creating Step-by-Step Sequences**\n\nCreating effective sequences requires breaking down problems into small, manageable steps. This process is called \"**decomposition**\" and is a fundamental programming skill.\n### **Writing Clear Instructions**\n\nWhen writing sequences, clarity is essential. Each step should:\n- Be specific and unambiguous\n- Contain only one action\n- Use precise language\n- Follow a logical order\nConsider the difference between these instructions:\n- Vague: \"Make the robot move to the box\"\n- Clear: \"Move the robot forward 3 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move forward 2 steps\"\n- Contain only one action\n### **Logical Flow and Order**\n\nThe order of steps in a sequence matters tremendously. For example, trying to pour milk before opening the carton won't work! In programming, executing steps in the wrong order can produce completely incorrect results or cause the program to crash.\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about making a cup of tea or coffee. What would happen if you performed the steps in a different order? Consider how changing the sequence (like adding sugar before the water) would affect the final result.\n## **Building Your First Programs**\n\nIn visual programming environments like Scratch or Blockly, sequences are built by connecting blocks that represent different actions.\n### **Visual Programming Blocks**\n\nVisual programming uses colored blocks that snap together to form sequences. The blocks typically include:\n- Motion blocks (move, turn)\n- Control blocks (wait, repeat)\n- Sensor blocks (detect obstacles)\n- Output blocks (display, make sound)\n\nEach block represents a single instruction, and the sequence reads from top to bottom.\n### **Creating a Basic Sequence Program**\n\nLet's create a simple program for a robot to navigate around an obstacle:\n1. Move forward 2 steps\n2. Turn right 90 degrees\n3. Move forward 3 steps\n4. Turn left 90 degrees\n5. Move forward 2 steps\n\nThis sequence creates a path that moves around an imaginary obstacle in your way.\n### **From Simple to Complex Algorithms**\n\nThe same principles you use to create simple algorithms can be applied to more complex robotics challenges:\n\n- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently\n- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement\n- A robot arm in a factory uses algorithms to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes\n\nAs robots become more advanced, their algorithms include more steps and decision points, but they still follow the same basic principles of clear, ordered instructions.\n## **Activity 2: Building a Simple Sequence**\n\nUsing a visual programming environment (or drawing on paper), create a sequence of commands that would guide a robot to draw a square. Your program should include movement commands (forward, backward) and turning commands (right, left). Think carefully about the order of commands and how many times each action needs to be performed. Test your sequence by tracing through it step by step to verify it works correctly.\n## **Common Sequence Errors and Solutions**\n\nEven experienced programmers make mistakes when creating sequences. Let's explore common errors and how to fix them.\n### **Typical Sequence Problems**\n1. **Missing steps**: Skipping a necessary action in the sequence\n2. **Incorrect order**: Putting steps in an illogical order\n3. **Ambiguous instructions**: Using unclear directions that could be interpreted multiple ways\n4. **Infinite loops**: Creating sequences that never end\n- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently\n- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement\n### **Debugging Your Sequences**\n\n**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code:\n1. Test your sequence by walking through it step-by-step\n2. Identify where things go wrong\n3. Modify the sequence to fix the problem\n4. Test again until it works correctly\n\nFor example, if your robot is supposed to navigate around a chair but keeps bumping into it, you might need to:\n- Check if your turning angles are correct (90° vs 45°)\n- Verify if your forward movement distances are appropriate\n- Make sure you're not missing a step in your sequence\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you followed directions that were out of order or had missing steps. What happened? How does this experience relate to the importance of creating precise, well-ordered algorithms in programming?\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhy is the correct order important in a programming sequence?\n\nA. It isn't important as long as all steps are included\n\nB. It only matters for advanced programs\n\nC. The computer won't run programs with steps in the wrong order\n\nD. The wrong order can produce incorrect results\n---answer---\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\n\nSequencer game: Players must arrange a series of programming blocks in the correct order to complete a specific task, such as navigating a robot through a maze. For example, students would be given a jumbled set of command blocks (move forward, turn left, turn right, etc.) and must arrange them in the proper sequence to successfully guide the robot to its destination without hitting walls or obstacles.\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n4. Test again until it works correctly\n\nFor example, if your robot is supposed to navigate around a chair but keeps bumping into it, you might need to:\n- Check if your turning angles are correct (90° vs 45°)\n- Verify if your forward movement distances are appropriate\n- Make sure you're not missing a step in your sequence\n\nRemember, even professional programmers spend much of their time debugging!\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you followed directions that were out of order or had missing steps.

The wrong order can produce incorrect results\n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\nThe correct answer is D. The wrong order can produce incorrect results. Just like following a recipe, programming steps must be in the correct order to achieve the intended result. If you chose a different answer, remember that computers follow instructions exactly as given—they don't understand intent or rearrange steps to make sense of them.\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nSequencer game: Players must arrange a series of programming blocks in the correct order to complete a specific task, such as navigating a robot through a maze.

  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for proper HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\n\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs. A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n### 3. Page Break Markers\n\nInsert `---pagebreak---` markers at logical page breaks in the document where it makes sense for PDF printing.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics\nThis chapter covers the basic concepts of robotics, including definitions, history, and key components.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Chapter 2: Robot Sensors\nThis chapter explores the various types of sensors used in robotics.\n```\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\nNote that each question and each answer option MUST be separated by an empty line for proper HTML rendering.\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Identify major section transitions where a page break would be appropriate\n2. Focus on these key locations:\n   - Between major sections or chapters\n   - After complete topic areas\n   - Where content naturally transitions to a new concept\n   - Before or after large diagrams or image descriptions\n3. Use page breaks sparingly - when in doubt, use fewer page breaks\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense for printing\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance.\nAnother misconception is that all robots are autonomous. In reality, many robots require continuous human control and are not capable of making decisions on their own.\n\n## Types of Robot Control Systems\nThere are several methods for controlling robots, from direct manual control to fully autonomous operation.\n```\n\n**Transformed:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

Think of algorithms as recipes: they tell you exactly what to do and in what order to achieve a specific result.\n\nIn programming, algorithms are the foundation of how computers process information. Robots and computers don't understand vague instructions—they need precise, ordered steps to follow.\n\n### **Real-World Algorithms**\n\nAlgorithms are all around us! When you tie your shoes, brush your teeth, or make a sandwich, you're following an algorithm. These everyday sequences help us understand how computers process instructions:\n\n1. **Brushing teeth algorithm**:\n   - Wet toothbrush\n   - Apply toothpaste\n   - Brush all surfaces of teeth\n   - Rinse mouth\n   - Rinse toothbrush\n   - Rinse mouth\n\nEven video games use algorithms to determine how characters move or react to player actions. For example:\n\n- In a racing game, an algorithm calculates when your car should slow down on curves\n- School security systems use algorithms to decide when to lock doors or sound alarms\n- Music apps use algorithms to suggest songs you might like based on what you've listened to before\n- Traffic lights use algorithms to control the timing of red, yellow, and green signals to manage traffic flow\n\n## **Activity 1: Decomposing a Daily Routine**\n\nChoose a simple daily task like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or tying shoelaces. Write down every single step required to complete the task, being as precise as possible. Try to be so detailed that someone who has never done this task before could follow your instructions perfectly. Share your steps with a friend or family member and see if they can follow them exactly without any additional information.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Creating Step-by-Step Sequences**\n\nCreating effective sequences requires breaking down problems into small, manageable steps. This process is called \"**decomposition**\" and is a fundamental programming skill.\n\n### **Writing Clear Instructions**\n\nWhen writing sequences, clarity is essential. Each step should:\n- Be specific and unambiguous\n- Contain only one action\n- Use precise language\n- Follow a logical order\n\nConsider the difference between these instructions:\n- Vague: \"Make the robot move to the box\"\n- Clear: \"Move the robot forward 3 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move forward 2 steps\"\n- Contain only one action\n\n### **Logical Flow and Order**\n\nThe order of steps in a sequence matters tremendously. For example, trying to pour milk before opening the carton won't work! In programming, executing steps in the wrong order can produce completely incorrect results or cause the program to crash.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about making a cup of tea or coffee. What would happen if you performed the steps in a different order? Consider how changing the sequence (like adding sugar before the water) would affect the final result.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Building Your First Programs**\n\nIn visual programming environments like Scratch or Blockly, sequences are built by connecting blocks that represent different actions.\n\n### **Visual Programming Blocks**\n\nVisual programming uses colored blocks that snap together to form sequences. The blocks typically include:\n- Motion blocks (move, turn)\n- Control blocks (wait, repeat)\n- Sensor blocks (detect obstacles)\n- Output blocks (display, make sound)\n\nEach block represents a single instruction, and the sequence reads from top to bottom.\n\n### **Creating a Basic Sequence Program**\n\nLet's create a simple program for a robot to navigate around an obstacle:\n1. Move forward 2 steps\n2. Turn right 90 degrees\n3. Move forward 3 steps\n4. Turn left 90 degrees\n5. Move forward 2 steps\n\nThis sequence creates a path that moves around an imaginary obstacle in your way.\n\n### **From Simple to Complex Algorithms**\n\nThe same principles you use to create simple algorithms can be applied to more complex robotics challenges:\n\n- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently\n- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement\n- A robot arm in a factory uses algorithms to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes\n\nAs robots become more advanced, their algorithms include more steps and decision points, but they still follow the same basic principles of clear, ordered instructions.\n\n## **Activity 2: Building a Simple Sequence**\n\nUsing a visual programming environment (or drawing on paper), create a sequence of commands that would guide a robot to draw a square. Your program should include movement commands (forward, backward) and turning commands (right, left). Think carefully about the order of commands and how many times each action needs to be performed. Test your sequence by tracing through it step by step to verify it works correctly.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Common Sequence Errors and Solutions**\n\nEven experienced programmers make mistakes when creating sequences. Let's explore common errors and how to fix them.\n\n### **Typical Sequence Problems**\n1. **Missing steps**: Skipping a necessary action in the sequence\n2. **Incorrect order**: Putting steps in an illogical order\n3. **Ambiguous instructions**: Using unclear directions that could be interpreted multiple ways\n4. **Infinite loops**: Creating sequences that never end\n- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently\n- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement\n\n### **Debugging Your Sequences**\n\n**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code:\n1. Test your sequence by walking through it step-by-step\n2. Identify where things go wrong\n3. Modify the sequence to fix the problem\n4. Test again until it works correctly\n\nFor example, if your robot is supposed to navigate around a chair but keeps bumping into it, you might need to:\n- Check if your turning angles are correct (90° vs 45°)\n- Verify if your forward movement distances are appropriate\n- Make sure you're not missing a step in your sequence\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you followed directions that were out of order or had missing steps. What happened? How does this experience relate to the importance of creating precise, well-ordered algorithms in programming?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhy is the correct order important in a programming sequence?\n\nA. It isn't important as long as all steps are included\n\nB. It only matters for advanced programs\n\nC. The computer won't run programs with steps in the wrong order\n\nD. The wrong order can produce incorrect results\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is D. The wrong order can produce incorrect results. Just like following a recipe, programming steps must be in the correct order to achieve the intended result. If you chose a different answer, remember that computers follow instructions exactly as given—they don't understand intent or rearrange steps to make sense of them.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\n\nSequencer game: Players must arrange a series of programming blocks in the correct order to complete a specific task, such as navigating a robot through a maze. For example, students would be given a jumbled set of command blocks (move forward, turn left, turn right, etc.) and must arrange them in the proper sequence to successfully guide the robot to its destination without hitting walls or obstacles."
