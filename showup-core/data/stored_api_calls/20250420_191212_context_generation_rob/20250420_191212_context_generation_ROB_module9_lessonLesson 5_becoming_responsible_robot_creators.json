Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

Now it's time to bring all these ideas together to create a complete picture of robot ethics. Think of it like assembling puzzle pieces - each ethical concept is important on its own, but when we connect them, we get a much clearer view of how to create robots responsibly.\n\n### Reviewing Key Ethical Concepts\nLet's refresh our memory about the main ethical approaches we've learned:\n\nFirst, we explored utilitarian ethics, which focuses on creating the most good for the most people. When designing robots, this means thinking about how your creation will benefit society as a whole. For example, a delivery robot that reduces pollution and gets medicine to people faster creates a lot of good.\n\nWe also learned about deontological ethics, which is about following important rules and respecting people's rights. This means designing robots that respect privacy, get proper consent, and never trick or manipulate people. A robot that secretly records conversations would violate this principle.\n\nFinally, we discussed virtue ethics, which focuses on developing good character traits like honesty, fairness, and compassion. This approach asks: \"What would a virtuous robot creator do?\" It might mean designing robots that promote positive values and refusing to create robots that could harm or disrespect people.\n\n### Connecting Ethics Across the Input-Processing-Output Framework\nEthics applies to every part of how a robot works:\n\nFor inputs (what robots sense), ethical questions include: Is the robot collecting data fairly? Is it respecting privacy? Are its sensors gathering information from diverse groups of people? For example, a facial recognition robot should be trained to recognize all skin tones equally well.\n\nFor processing (how robots think), we need to consider: Are the robot's decision-making algorithms fair? Do they contain hidden biases? Are they transparent enough that people can understand them? A robot that decides who gets a loan should make fair decisions regardless of a person's background.\n\nFor outputs (what robots do), ethical questions include: Are the robot's actions safe? Do they benefit people equally? Could they cause unexpected problems? A helpful robot assistant should be designed to serve everyone's needs, not just those of certain groups.\n\n### Creating a Comprehensive Ethical Approach\nCreating truly ethical robots requires combining all these perspectives. No single approach gives us all the answers. \n\nThink of it like checking your work from multiple angles. A utilitarian approach helps us consider the big-picture benefits of our robot. Deontological ethics reminds us to respect individual rights and follow important rules. Virtue ethics encourages us to design with good character and positive values.\n\nBy using all these approaches together, we can catch ethical problems that might slip through if we only used one approach. For instance, a robot might seem beneficial overall (passing the utilitarian test) but might violate privacy rights (failing the deontological test). The best robot designs satisfy multiple ethical frameworks.\n\n## **Activity 1: Ethical Design Checklist Creation**\nIn this activity, you'll begin developing a comprehensive checklist of ethical considerations to guide your future robot designs. Start by listing at least five ethical principles you believe are most important in robot creation. For each principle, write one specific design question that could help evaluate whether a robot design adheres to that principle. This checklist will serve as a practical tool you can use and expand throughout your career.\n## Anticipating Consequences\nOne of the most important skills for ethical robot creators is the ability to look ahead and imagine what might happen when your robot enters the real world. This isn't about predicting the future perfectly - it's about thinking carefully about possibilities so you can design better, safer robots from the start.\n\n### Identifying Potential Outcomes\nTo anticipate consequences, robot creators use several helpful techniques:\n\nStakeholder analysis involves identifying all the people who might be affected by your robot. For a delivery robot, stakeholders include the customers receiving packages, pedestrians sharing the sidewalk, local businesses, and even pets who might encounter the robot. For each stakeholder, ask: \"How might this robot affect them, both positively and negatively?\"\n\nEthical impact assessments are more formal evaluations that systematically examine potential effects. This involves asking questions like: \"Could this robot unintentionally exclude certain groups of people?\" or \"Might this robot create new safety risks?\" For example, a robot designed to help elderly people might accidentally increase isolation if it reduces human contact.\n\nScenario planning involves imagining different situations where your robot might operate and considering what could go wrong. For instance, if you're designing a robot to help during emergencies, you might ask: \"What if the robot encounters a situation it wasn't programmed to handle?\" or \"What if people come to rely too much on the robot and lose important skills?\"\n\n### Testing and Iteration for Ethical Improvement\nOnce you've identified potential issues, testing helps determine if your concerns are valid and how to address them:\n\nDiverse testing groups are essential. If you only test your robot with people similar to yourself, you'll miss important feedback. Include people of different ages, abilities, backgrounds, and experiences in your testing.\n\nStaged testing means starting in simple, controlled environments before moving to more complex, real-world situations. For example, a classroom helper robot might first be tested with just one student in a quiet room, then with a small group, and finally in a busy classroom.\n\nEthical metrics help measure aspects of your robot's performance that matter ethically. Beyond just checking if your robot works technically, you might measure things like: \"How often does the robot correctly understand commands from people with different accents?\" or \"Does the robot's presence increase or decrease stress levels?\"\n\nRemember that ethical testing is an ongoing process. The first version of your robot will never be perfect, but through careful testing and improvement, you can make each version better and more ethically sound.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** What ethical principle do you think is most important to consider when designing robots, and why? Consider how this principle might influence specific design choices you would make.\n\n### Responding to Unintended Consequences\nEven with careful planning, robots sometimes cause unexpected problems once they're being used. Ethical robot creators need strategies for handling these situations:\n\nFirst, establish monitoring systems to catch problems early. This might include regular check-ins with users, automated reporting of unusual behaviors, or ongoing testing as the robot operates in the real world. The sooner you identify an issue, the easier it is to fix.\n\nWhen problems arise, acknowledge them openly rather than hiding them. Being honest about mistakes builds trust and helps prevent similar problems in the future. For example, if your robot assistant is accidentally sharing private information, tell users immediately and explain how you're fixing it.\n\nDevelop a response plan before problems occur. This includes having clear steps for addressing different types of issues, from minor glitches to serious safety concerns. In some cases, you might need to temporarily disable certain robot features or even recall robots until problems are fixed.\n\nLearn from each unexpected consequence to improve future designs. Each problem is an opportunity to make your robots better. For instance, if your robot struggles to navigate around wheelchairs, this reveals an important design challenge that, once solved, will make your robot more inclusive.\n\n## Personal Responsibility in Technology Creation\nCreating robots isn't just about technical skills—it's also about taking responsibility for what you build and how it affects the world. As robot creators, we have special obligations because our creations can directly impact people's lives, safety, and well-being.\n\n### The Creator's Role and Impact\nRobot creators have unique responsibilities because of their position:\n\nYou have insider knowledge about how your robot works that others don't have. This means you can spot potential problems that users might not see until it's too late. With this knowledge comes the responsibility to address issues proactively.\n\nYour design choices shape how people interact with technology. For example, if you design a robot that interrupts people frequently, you might unintentionally encourage rudeness. If you design a robot that always obeys commands without question, you might reinforce unhealthy power dynamics.\n\nThe impacts of your creation can extend far beyond what you initially imagine. A robot designed for one purpose might be used for others, or might change how people behave in unexpected ways. For instance, a classroom robot might change how students learn or affect how teachers teach.\n\nRemember that \"I didn't mean for that to happen\" isn't a good excuse when problems occur. As a creator, you're responsible for thinking through potential consequences and designing to prevent harm.\n\n### Building an Ethical Design Process\nEthics shouldn't be an afterthought—it should be built into every step of creating a robot:\n\nStart with ethical questions. Before writing any code or building any parts, ask: \"What is this robot for? Who will benefit? Could anyone be harmed or excluded? Is this robot addressing a real need?\"\n\nInclude diverse perspectives throughout the design process. Consult with people from different backgrounds, abilities, and experiences. They'll help you spot potential problems you might miss and suggest improvements you might not think of.\n\nCreate ethical checkpoints at key stages of development. Before moving from one stage to the next (like from design to prototyping, or from testing to release), pause to evaluate ethical considerations. Ask: \"Have we addressed the ethical concerns we identified earlier? Have new concerns emerged?\"\n\nDocument your ethical decisions. Keep track of the ethical questions you considered and how you addressed them. This helps you learn from experience and demonstrates your commitment to responsible creation.\n\n### Check your understanding\nAs a responsible robot creator, what should you do when you discover your robot design might have an unintended negative consequence?\nA. Ignore the issue since all technology has some problems\nB. Hide the problem from users but continue development\nC. Release the robot anyway and fix problems in the next version\nD. Redesign to address the issue, even if it delays your project\nChoose your answer and check it below.\nThe correct answer is D. Redesign to address the issue, even if it delays your project. Responsible technology creation requires addressing potential negative consequences before implementation. While it may be tempting to move forward and fix issues later, this approach can cause real harm to users and damage trust. If you chose a different answer, remember that ethical creators prioritize safety and wellbeing over speed of development.\n\n### Communicating About Ethics With Others\nCreating ethical robots is rarely a solo effort—it requires talking with many different people about ethical concerns:\n\nWhen working with team members, establish shared ethical values early. Create a space where anyone can raise ethical concerns without fear. Sometimes the newest team member spots an important issue that everyone else missed.\n\nWhen communicating with stakeholders (like investors or school administrators), explain how ethical considerations strengthen your robot design rather than limiting it. Help them understand that addressing ethical issues early prevents costly problems later.\n\nWhen talking with users, be transparent about what your robot can and can't do. Avoid overpromising or hiding limitations. For example, if your robot sometimes makes mistakes in noisy environments, make this clear to users so they can plan accordingly.\n\nUse clear, everyday language when discussing ethics. Avoid technical jargon that might confuse people. Instead of saying \"The robot implements ethical algorithm constraints,\" say something like \"We've designed the robot to prioritize safety and fairness when making decisions.\"\n\n## Ethical Design Checklist\nHaving a systematic way to evaluate the ethics of your robot designs helps ensure you don't overlook important considerations. A well-designed ethical checklist serves as both a guide during creation and an evaluation tool for finished designs.\n\n### Creating Assessment Criteria\nA good ethical assessment needs clear, specific criteria that you can actually measure:\n\nMake your criteria specific and actionable. Instead of a vague criterion like \"The robot should be fair,\" use something more specific like \"The robot should respond equally well to commands from all users regardless of their accent or speech patterns.\"\n\nInclude both technical and social criteria. Technical criteria might include things like \"The robot stops immediately when it detects unexpected obstacles\" while social criteria might include \"The robot's appearance and behavior don't reinforce harmful stereotypes.\"\n\nCreate criteria that address different ethical frameworks. Include utilitarian considerations (Does this robot create more benefit than harm?), rights-based considerations (Does this robot respect privacy and autonomy?), and virtue considerations (Does this robot encourage positive interactions?).\n\nDevelop criteria for each stage of the robot's lifecycle. Consider ethical questions related to how the robot is built (Are materials sustainably sourced?), how it operates (Is data collection transparent?), and what happens when it's no longer used (Can components be recycled?).\n\nRemember that your ethical criteria will evolve as you learn more. Start with what you know now, but be ready to add new criteria as you discover new ethical considerations.\n\n## **Activity 2: Robot Ethics Pledge**\nCreate a personal ethics pledge that outlines your commitments as a technology creator. Your pledge should include at least three specific ethical principles you commit to upholding and briefly explain how you'll integrate each principle into your design process. This pledge will serve as a reminder of your ethical responsibilities and can be revisited throughout your career in robotics.\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** How has your thinking about robot ethics changed since the beginning of this module? Reflect on which concepts have most influenced your perspective on responsible robot creation.\n\n### Applying the Checklist to Robot Designs\nOnce you have your ethical criteria, you need to apply them consistently to evaluate robot designs:\n\nUse your checklist throughout the design process, not just at the end. Apply it when you're brainstorming ideas, creating prototypes, and testing your robot. It's much easier to make changes early in the process than after your robot is built.\n\nBe honest in your assessments. It's natural to want your creation to pass all ethical criteria, but identifying problems is the first step to fixing them. For example, if your robot helper works well for right-handed users but is awkward for left-handed users, acknowledging this bias allows you to improve the design.\n\nPrioritize which issues to address first. Some ethical concerns are more urgent than others. Safety issues that could cause physical harm should generally be addressed before issues of convenience or aesthetic design.\n\nDocument both strengths and weaknesses. Note which ethical criteria your robot meets well and which need improvement. This creates a balanced picture and helps track progress over time. For instance, your robot might excel at energy efficiency but need work on inclusive design.\n\nConsider getting outside perspectives. Sometimes we're too close to our own creations to see problems clearly. Ask others to apply your ethical checklist to your robot design and listen carefully to their feedback.\n\n### Continuous Ethical Improvement\nEthical design isn't a one-time task—it's an ongoing process of learning and improvement:\n\nSchedule regular ethical reviews of your robot designs. As your robot operates in the real world, new ethical considerations may emerge that weren't obvious during initial design. Set aside time to specifically look for these issues.\n\nStay informed about evolving ethical standards. What's considered acceptable in robot design changes over time as technology advances and social values evolve. Follow discussions about robot ethics in news, research, and among other creators.\n\nLearn from ethical successes and failures in other robots. When other robot creators face ethical challenges or develop innovative ethical solutions, consider how these lessons apply to your own work.\n\nInvolve users in the improvement process. The people who use your robots often have the best insights into ethical issues that arise in real-world use. Create easy ways for users to provide feedback about ethical concerns.\n\nRemember that ethical improvement never really ends. Even the most thoughtfully designed robots can be made better as we learn more about their impacts and as technology advances.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Responsible robot creation requires considering ethics throughout the design process from initial concept to implementation and beyond\n- Anticipating consequences and testing for potential problems is an essential part of ethical design that helps prevent harm before it occurs\n- Personal commitment to ethical principles guides responsible technology creation and forms the foundation of professional integrity\n[End of Lesson]\n## Instructional designer notes of lesson 9.5\n**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 9 in the following ways:**\n- It serves as the culminating lesson that synthesizes all previous lessons in the module, helping students integrate ethical principles, safety considerations, societal impacts, and inclusive design\n- It builds on previous lessons by moving from individual ethical concepts to a comprehensive framework for ethical robot design\n- It transitions students from learning about ethics to applying ethics in their own design work\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nCapstone Project - Ethical Robot Design Challenge: Student teams design a robot for a specific purpose (like a home helper robot), creating a presentation that highlights how their design addresses ethical considerations, safety features, privacy protections, societal impacts, and accessibility. Teams would evaluate each other's designs using ethical criteria developed in the lesson.\n</CONTENT>\n",
