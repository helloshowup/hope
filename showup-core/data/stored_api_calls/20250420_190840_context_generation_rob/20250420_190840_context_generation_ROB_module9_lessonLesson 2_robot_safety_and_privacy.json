Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

One of the most important safety features is collision detection, which helps robots sense when they're about to bump into something or someone. This works using sensors that act like the robot's \"eyes\" and \"skin\" to detect nearby objects.\n\nAnother key safety feature is the emergency stop button, sometimes called the \"e-stop.\" This is usually a big red button that immediately shuts down the robot if there's a problem. Think of it like a pause button that works instantly to freeze the robot in place. Many robots also have motion limitations built into their design, which prevent them from moving too quickly or reaching into spaces where they might hurt someone.\n\nFor robots that work with children or in public spaces, soft materials and rounded edges are essential to prevent injuries. Some advanced robots even have force-sensing technology that can tell how much pressure they're applying, so they can hold an egg without breaking it or shake a person's hand without squeezing too hard.\n\nIn robot vacuums that many families have at home, bump sensors help them navigate around furniture without getting stuck. When the robot touches a chair leg or wall, these sensors tell it to change direction. This is a simple but important safety feature that prevents damage to both your furniture and the robot itself.\n\n### [h3] Safety Standards and Testing Procedures\n\nBefore robots can be used in schools, homes, or hospitals, they need to pass special tests to make sure they're safe. Different countries have organizations that create safety rules for robots. In the United States, organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Robotics Industries Association (RIA) set these standards.\n\nTesting a robot for safety involves checking many different things. Engineers might test how the robot responds when it encounters an obstacle, whether its emergency stop works properly, and if it can operate safely even when something unexpected happens. They also check if the robot's batteries are safe and won't overheat or catch fire.\n\nRobots that pass all these tests receive certifications, which are like badges showing they've met the safety requirements. When you see labels like \"UL Listed\" or \"CE Marked\" on a robot, it means the robot has been tested and meets specific safety standards. These certifications help schools, parents, and other users know which robots are safe to use.\n\nFor example, educational robots used in classrooms must meet strict safety standards. They're tested to make sure they don't have sharp edges, small parts that could be swallowed, or batteries that could leak. These standards are especially important for robots that will be around children.\n\n### [h3] Emergency Protocols and Fail-Safes\n\nEven the best-designed robots can sometimes have problems, which is why emergency protocols and fail-safes are so important. A fail-safe is a backup system that activates when something goes wrong, like how a circuit breaker cuts off electricity if there's too much power flowing through it.\n\nRedundant systems are one type of fail-safe used in robots. This means having two or more ways to perform critical functions, so if one system fails, another can take over. For example, a robot might have multiple ways to detect obstacles or more than one computer monitoring its movements.\n\nEmergency shutdown procedures are also crucial. If a robot detects a problem it can't solve, it should be programmed to safely power down. For robots that lift or carry things, they should be designed to gently lower objects rather than dropping them if power is lost. Some robots even have mechanical brakes that automatically engage when power is cut off, preventing the robot from moving in unexpected ways during an emergency.\n\nThink about a helper robot in a school that carries books or supplies. If its battery suddenly gets low, a good fail-safe would make it slowly put down whatever it's carrying and then safely stop moving, rather than dropping everything and shutting down immediately.\n\n## [h2] **Activity 1: Safety Feature Design Challenge**\nDesign three essential safety features for a robot intended for classroom use with elementary school students. Create a simple sketch or diagram of each feature and explain how it works, why it's necessary, and how it would prevent potential accidents or injuries. Consider mechanical, electrical, and software safety elements in your design.\n## [h2] Robot Sensors and Data Collection\nThis section examines the various ways robots gather information from their environment and the privacy considerations that arise.\n### [h3] Types of Data Robots Collect\n\nRobots use many different types of sensors to understand and interact with the world around them. These sensors are like the robot's eyes, ears, and sense of touch, helping them gather information about their surroundings.\n\nVisual data comes from cameras that allow robots to \"see\" their environment. These cameras can capture images and videos of people, objects, and spaces. Some advanced robots use special 3D cameras that can measure distances and create detailed maps of rooms. When a robot vacuum moves around your home, it's using visual sensors to avoid furniture and find areas that need cleaning.\n\nAudio data is collected through microphones that let robots \"hear\" sounds, voices, and commands. Voice-activated robots like smart speakers are constantly listening for their wake word (like \"Hey Siri\" or \"Alexa\") and then record what you say after that to process your request.\n\nLocation and movement data helps robots know where they are and how they're moving. Sensors like GPS, accelerometers, and gyroscopes track position, speed, and direction. A delivery robot uses this type of data to navigate from one place to another without getting lost.\n\nRobots also collect interaction data, which includes information about how people use and engage with them. This might include which buttons you press, what commands you give, or how often you use certain features. This helps the robot learn your preferences and improve its performance over time.\n\nFor example, a smart home robot might collect:\n- Visual data: Images of your living room to navigate around furniture\n- Audio data: Your voice commands asking it to turn on lights\n- Location data: Maps of your home to remember where rooms are\n- Interaction data: Which family members use which features most often\n\nEach type of data helps the robot work better, but also raises questions about privacy that we need to consider.\n\n### [h3] Data Storage, Processing, and Usage\n\nOnce robots collect data, they need to store and process it to make it useful. Some robots store data locally, which means the information stays inside the robot itself. This is like saving photos on your phone instead of uploading them to the internet. Local storage can be more private because the data doesn't leave the device, but it limits how much the robot can learn and improve.\n\nOther robots use cloud storage, sending data to remote servers through the internet. This allows for more powerful processing and enables the robot to learn from many users' experiences. For example, when one robot vacuum discovers a better way to clean a certain type of carpet, all connected robots can benefit from this knowledge. However, cloud storage raises more privacy concerns because your data is traveling over networks and being stored on computers you don't control.\n\nRobots process data for many different purposes. They use it to navigate environments, recognize objects and people, understand commands, and learn from experience. Some robots analyze patterns in data to predict what you might want or need. For instance, a smart home robot might learn your daily routine and automatically adjust lighting or temperature based on your habits.\n\nCompanies that make robots also use collected data to improve their products, fix bugs, and develop new features. Sometimes they share anonymous, combined data (called aggregate data) with partners or researchers to advance robotics technology.\n\nWhen a robot vacuum maps your home, it might store that map in different ways:\n- Local storage: The map stays only in your robot\n- Cloud storage: The map is sent to the company's servers\n- Shared storage: Anonymous parts of the map might be used to help all robots get better at navigating around furniture\n\nEach storage method has different privacy implications that users should understand.\n\n### [h3] Privacy Vulnerabilities and Protections\n\nRobots that collect data can have privacy vulnerabilities – weaknesses that might allow your personal information to be accessed by unauthorized people. One risk is data breaches, where hackers break into systems and steal information. Another concern is that companies might use your data in ways you didn't expect or agree to.\n\nTo protect privacy, robot designers use both technological and policy approaches. Technological protections include encryption, which scrambles data so only authorized users can read it, and access controls that limit who can view certain information. Some robots are designed with \"privacy by default,\" meaning they collect only the minimum amount of data needed to function.\n\nPolicy protections include privacy policies that explain what data is collected and how it's used, and laws that regulate data collection and storage. In many places, companies must get your permission before collecting certain types of personal information.\n\nUsers can also take steps to protect their privacy when using robots. This might include reviewing privacy settings, turning off certain features when they're not needed (like microphones or cameras), and being thoughtful about what information you share with your robot. Just as you wouldn't tell a stranger your secrets, you should be careful about what you say or do around robots that are recording.\n\nFor example, if you have a robot toy that can record conversations, you might:\n- Check if it has an indicator light that shows when it's recording\n- Learn how to turn off the microphone when you're not using it\n- Ask a parent to review the privacy settings and what information is being shared\n- Be careful about sharing personal information when playing with it\n\nThese simple steps can help protect your privacy while still enjoying the benefits of robotic technology.\n\n## [h2] Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the last time you interacted with a smart device (like a voice assistant or robot vacuum). What data might it have collected about you and your environment? How comfortable are you with this collection, and why?\n\n## [h2] Balancing Functionality with Privacy and Safety\nThis section explores the challenge of creating effective robots while respecting ethical boundaries around safety and privacy.\n### [h3] Identifying Necessary vs. Optional Features\n\nWhen designing robots, engineers need to carefully consider which features are truly necessary and which ones might create unnecessary risks. Necessary features are those that the robot needs to accomplish its core purpose. For example, a robot vacuum cleaner needs wheels to move, brushes to clean, and sensors to avoid falling down stairs. These features are essential for the robot to do its job.\n\nOptional features might make a robot more convenient or impressive, but aren't required for its main function. A robot vacuum might include a camera that creates a map of your home to improve cleaning efficiency. While helpful, this feature isn't absolutely necessary for cleaning floors and creates additional privacy concerns since it's capturing images of your home.\n\nTo determine if a feature is necessary, designers can ask questions like: \"Can the robot still perform its core function without this feature?\" and \"Does the benefit of this feature outweigh the potential risks?\" For instance, a delivery robot needs location tracking to find its destination, so this feature is necessary despite privacy implications. However, a toy robot probably doesn't need to record conversations, so this would be an optional feature with privacy risks that might outweigh its benefits.\n\nBy carefully separating necessary from optional features, robot designers can create products that work well while minimizing unnecessary risks to safety and privacy.\n\nConsider a robot designed to help people with disabilities:\n- Necessary feature: Sensors to detect obstacles so it doesn't bump into the person\n- Optional feature: A camera that constantly records everything the person does\n\nThe first feature is essential for safety, while the second might be helpful in some situations but creates significant privacy concerns and isn't required for the robot's main purpose of providing assistance.\n\n### [h3] Privacy-by-Design Principles\n\nPrivacy-by-Design is an approach that considers privacy from the very beginning of creating a robot, rather than trying to add it later. It's like building a house with security features included in the blueprints, instead of trying to add locks and alarms after the house is already built.\n\nThere are several important principles in Privacy-by-Design. First is data minimization, which means collecting only the information that's absolutely necessary. If a robot doesn't need to know your name or what you look like to vacuum your floor, it shouldn't collect that information.\n\nAnother principle is purpose limitation, which means using data only for the specific reason it was collected. If a robot collects your voice to respond to commands, it shouldn't also use that data to figure out your age or mood unless you've agreed to this.\n\nTransparency is also crucial – robots and their makers should clearly explain what data they're collecting and why. This might include lights that show when cameras or microphones are active, or simple explanations of how data is used.\n\nUser control is another key principle, giving people choices about what data is collected and how it's used. This could include easy-to-use privacy settings or the ability to delete stored information.\n\nWhen robot designers follow these Privacy-by-Design principles, they create products that respect people's privacy while still providing useful functions. This builds trust with users and helps prevent privacy problems before they occur.\n\nFor example, a school robot that helps teach math might apply these principles by:\n- Only collecting data about math problems students solve (data minimization)\n- Using this data only to adjust teaching difficulty, not for other purposes (purpose limitation)\n- Having a clear display showing when it's recording student responses (transparency)\n- Letting students or teachers easily delete their data when desired (user control)\n\n## [h2] **Activity 2: Privacy Impact Assessment**\nCreate a simple privacy impact assessment chart for a household robot assistant. List at least five types of data the robot might collect, explain why this data is necessary for its function, and identify one privacy concern for each data type. Finally, propose one mitigation strategy for each concern that balances functionality with privacy protection.\n### [h3] Communicating Safety and Privacy to Users\n\nClear communication about safety and privacy is essential for building trust between robot makers and users. When people understand what data a robot collects and how it's protected, they can make informed choices about using the technology.\n\nRobot manufacturers should use simple, easy-to-understand language when explaining privacy policies. Instead of long documents filled with technical terms, they can use visual aids like icons or short videos that clearly show what information is being collected and how it's used. For example, a simple diagram might show that a robot's camera is used for navigation but doesn't save or share images of people.\n\nSafety information should be equally clear, with straightforward explanations of what safety features are included and how users should interact with the robot to stay safe. This might include age recommendations, supervision requirements, or instructions for emergency situations. Warning labels should be visible and use universal symbols when possible.\n\nUser manuals and setup guides should include dedicated sections on privacy and safety, placed prominently rather than hidden in fine print. Digital interfaces on the robot itself can provide real-time information, such as indicators that light up when cameras or microphones are active, or notifications before new types of data collection begin.\n\nCompanies should also provide easy ways for users to ask questions about privacy and safety. This might include customer service contacts specifically for these concerns, or online resources with frequently asked questions and simple explanations. By making this information accessible and understandable, robot makers help users feel confident and in control when using their products.\n\nFor example, a good robot toy might include:\n- A simple picture guide showing what information it collects\n- Colored lights that show when it's listening or watching\n- Easy-to-understand settings that parents and kids can adjust together\n- Clear age recommendations and safety warnings on the box\n- A simple FAQ section answering common privacy and safety questions\n\nThese communication strategies help build trust and ensure that users understand how to use robots safely while protecting their privacy.\n\n## [h2] Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** What safety features would you prioritize in a robot designed to interact with elderly individuals or young children? Consider both physical safety mechanisms and privacy protections in your reflection.\n\n### **[h3] Check your understanding**\nA company is designing a robot that will help elderly people in their homes. Which of the following features raises the most significant privacy concerns?\nA. The robot can detect if a person has fallen\nB. The robot constantly records video in all rooms to monitor for emergencies\nC. The robot can measure room temperature\nD. The robot can lift and carry objects\nChoose your answer and check it below.\nThe correct answer is B. The robot constantly records video in all rooms to monitor for emergencies. While detecting falls is important for safety, constant video recording in all rooms is a significant privacy invasion. The company should consider less invasive alternatives like motion sensors or wearable fall detection devices that preserve privacy while maintaining safety. If you chose a different answer, consider how each feature impacts the balance between utility and privacy, and which ones could be redesigned to be less intrusive.\n## [h2] Key Takeaways\n- Physical safety features are essential in robot design and should prevent harm to users and bystanders\n- Robots collect various types of data through sensors, raising important privacy considerations\n- Good robot design balances functionality with appropriate safety measures and privacy protections\n[End of Lesson]\n## Instructional designer notes of lesson 9.2\n**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 9 in the following ways:**\n- This lesson builds on the ethical foundation from Lesson 1 by focusing specifically on safety and privacy considerations\n- It addresses two key practical applications of ethics in robotics: physical safety and data privacy\n- It supports the module's overall goal of helping students understand the responsible design and use of robotic technology\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nRole Play - Safety Inspector Challenge: Students review images or descriptions of robot designs and identify potential safety issues, then propose solutions to address each concern. For example, students might examine a robot kitchen assistant design and identify hazards like sharp appendages, hot surface contact risks, or privacy concerns from cameras, then recommend design modifications like rounded edges, heat shields, or limited camera field-of-view options.\n</CONTENT>\n",
