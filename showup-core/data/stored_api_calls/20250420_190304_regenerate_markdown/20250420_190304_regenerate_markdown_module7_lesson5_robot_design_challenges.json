In this section, we'll look at different robot challenges you can choose from to practice the engineering design process.\n\nEach challenge requires different robot capabilities, so you'll need to think carefully about what your robot needs to do. Remember that a well-defined problem makes finding a solution much easier!\n\n### [h3] Line-Following Challenge\nA line-following robot needs to track and follow a line drawn on the ground. This challenge tests your robot's ability to \"see\" using light sensors and make quick decisions about direction.\n\nYour robot will need sensors to detect the difference between the line (usually black) and the background (usually white). The robot must stay on the line even when it curves or makes sharp turns. You'll need to program your robot to adjust its wheels or motors based on what the sensors detect.\n\nSuccess in this challenge means your robot can follow the entire line without losing track or going off course. This is similar to how self-driving cars follow lane markings on roads!\n\n### [h3] Obstacle Course Challenge\nIn the obstacle course challenge, your robot must navigate through a path with various barriers and terrain changes. This tests your robot's ability to sense its environment and make decisions about how to move safely.\n\nYour robot might need to go around walls, climb small ramps, or squeeze through narrow passages. You'll need to think about what sensors your robot needs (like distance sensors or touch sensors) and how to program it to respond when it detects an obstacle.\n\nThis challenge is similar to how robots in warehouses or on other planets need to move around without bumping into things or getting stuck.\n\n### [h3] Object Sorting Challenge\nThe object sorting challenge asks your robot to identify different objects and sort them into the correct categories. For example, your robot might need to separate blue blocks from red blocks, or put small objects in one pile and large objects in another.\n\nYour robot will need sensors to detect color, size, or shape. It will also need a way to pick up and move objects, like a gripper arm or scoop. You'll program your robot to make decisions based on what it senses and then take action to sort each object correctly.\n\nThis challenge is similar to how recycling robots sort different materials or how factory robots organize products.\n\n### [h3] Custom Challenge Design\nIf you have your own robot challenge idea, you can create a custom challenge! The key is to clearly define what problem your robot will solve and how you'll know if it succeeds.\n\nWhen designing your own challenge, think about:\n- What specific task will your robot perform?\n- What environment will it operate in?\n- What would count as success?\n- What limitations or rules should apply?\n\nCreating your own challenge lets you focus on problems that interest you most, whether that's a robot that can play a simple game, care for a plant, or solve another problem you've identified.\n\n## [h2] **Activity 1: Challenge Selection and Problem Definition**\nSelect one of the robot challenges presented (or design your own) and develop a comprehensive problem statement. Define the specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria for your chosen challenge. Create a simple diagram illustrating the challenge environment and key elements your robot must interact with.\n## [h2] Planning and Design Application\nOnce you've selected your challenge and defined the problem, it's time to create a detailed plan for your robot. Good planning saves time and helps you avoid problems later in the design process.\n\nThink of this stage like drawing a blueprint before building a house - you want to work out all the details on paper before you start building!\n\n### [h3] Creating Comprehensive Challenge Plans\nA good robot design plan includes details about all the parts of your robot and why you chose them. Start by sketching what your robot will look like from different angles. Label all the important parts.\n\nFor each component of your robot, explain:\n- What it does (its function)\n- Why you chose it (your reasoning)\n- How it connects to other parts\n\nFor example, if you're building a line-following robot, your plan might include:\n- Two motors: To control the wheels independently so the robot can turn\n- Light sensors: To detect the line on the ground\n- A controller board: To run your program and connect all parts\n- Wheels: To move the robot smoothly on the surface\n\nInclude measurements and specific details whenever possible. This makes it easier to build exactly what you planned.\n\n### [h3] Setting Success Criteria\nSuccess criteria are specific goals that help you know if your robot works well. These should be measurable and directly related to your challenge.\n\nGood success criteria answer the question: \"How will I know if my robot is successful?\"\n\nFor example, success criteria for a line-following robot might include:\n- The robot follows the entire line without going off track\n- The robot completes the course in less than 2 minutes\n- The robot can handle curves with at least a 4-inch radius\n- The robot can recover if it briefly loses the line\n\nWrite down your success criteria before you start building. This gives you clear targets to aim for and helps you test your robot fairly.\n\n### [h3] Project Management Approaches\nManaging your robot project means organizing your time, materials, and tasks effectively. Even professional engineers use project management tools to stay organized!\n\nHere are some strategies to help manage your robot design project:\n\n1. Create a timeline with specific deadlines for each stage:\n   - Research and planning: 2 days\n   - Building the robot: 3 days\n   - Programming: 2 days\n   - Testing and improvements: 3 days\n\n2. Make a materials list with everything you'll need before you start building.\n\n3. Break down big tasks into smaller steps. Instead of \"build robot,\" list steps like \"attach wheels to motors\" and \"connect sensors to controller.\"\n\n4. Keep a project journal where you record what you did each day, problems you faced, and how you solved them.\n\nUsing these project management approaches will help you stay organized and make steady progress toward completing your robot challenge.\n\n## [h2] Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Reflect on how your understanding of robot design challenges has evolved since beginning this course. How has your approach to defining problems and establishing criteria changed?\n\n## [h2] Implementation and Testing Strategies\nNow it's time to build and test your robot design! This is where your plans come to life, but it's also where you'll discover things that need to be fixed or improved.\n\nRemember that testing is not just something you do at the end - it should happen throughout the building process to catch problems early.\n\n### [h3] Resources and Materials Management\nManaging your resources and materials effectively is crucial for a successful robot project. Here's how to do it well:\n\n1. Create a complete inventory of all parts and materials you need before starting. Group them by category (electronics, structural parts, tools, etc.).\n\n2. Check what materials you already have and what you need to get. Sometimes you can substitute one material for another if needed.\n\n3. Set up a clean, organized workspace with enough room to build and test your robot. Keep similar items together and label containers if possible.\n\n4. Handle delicate components with care. For example, electronic parts can be damaged by static electricity, and some sensors need to be kept clean.\n\n5. Reuse and recycle materials when possible. Many robot parts can be taken apart and used in future projects.\n\nGood resource management means you won't waste time looking for parts or run out of essential materials halfway through your project.\n\n### [h3] Timeline Development\nCreating a realistic timeline helps you complete your robot project on schedule. Here's how to develop an effective timeline:\n\n1. Start with the final deadline and work backward.\n\n2. Divide your project into phases:\n   - Planning phase: Research and design (20% of total time)\n   - Building phase: Constructing the physical robot (30% of total time)\n   - Programming phase: Writing and testing code (20% of total time)\n   - Testing phase: Evaluating and improving (20% of total time)\n   - Documentation phase: Recording your process (10% of total time)\n\n3. Set specific milestones to check your progress. For example:\n   - Day 3: Complete robot chassis construction\n   - Day 5: Finish basic movement programming\n   - Day 7: Robot successfully completes basic version of challenge\n\n4. Include buffer time for unexpected problems. Things almost always take longer than expected!\n\n5. Create a visual timeline chart and keep it visible in your workspace to stay on track.\n\nRemember that your timeline might need adjustments as you work, and that's okay. The goal is to have a plan that helps you manage your time effectively.\n\n### [h3] Collaborative Testing Approaches\nEven if you're working alone, you can use collaborative testing approaches to improve your robot design. These methods help you find and fix problems more effectively:\n\n1. \"Fresh eyes\" testing: Ask someone who hasn't seen your robot before to try using it or watching it perform. They might notice issues you've missed.\n\n2. Role-playing: Take on different roles yourself - be the builder, then the tester, then the user. Each perspective helps you see different aspects of your design.\n\n3. Structured testing protocols:\n   - Function testing: Test each part of your robot separately before testing the whole system\n   - Boundary testing: Try the extreme conditions (fastest speed, tightest turns, etc.)\n   - Failure testing: Intentionally create problems to see how your robot handles them\n\n4. Document all test results, including:\n   - What you tested\n   - How you tested it\n   - What worked well\n   - What problems you found\n   - How you fixed the problems\n\nGood testing is systematic and thorough. Don't just check if your robot works in ideal conditions - test it in all the conditions it might face during the challenge.\n\n## [h2] Documentation and Presentation\nDocumenting your robot design process is just as important as building the robot itself! Good documentation helps you track your progress, remember what you did, and share your work with others.\n\nThink of documentation as telling the story of your robot - from the first idea to the final design.\n\n### [h3] Design Portfolio Development\nA design portfolio is a collection of materials that shows your entire robot design journey. It's like a scrapbook of your project that helps others understand what you did and why.\n\nYour portfolio should include:\n\n1. The problem statement and requirements for your robot challenge\n2. Research you did before starting (including any similar robots you looked at)\n3. Sketches and diagrams of your initial design ideas\n4. Final design plans with detailed explanations\n5. Photos or drawings of your robot at different stages of construction\n6. Programming code with comments explaining how it works\n7. Test results and data you collected\n8. Changes you made based on testing\n9. Final evaluation of how well your robot met the requirements\n\nOrganize your portfolio in chronological order, from beginning to end. Use dividers or sections with clear labels to make it easy to find specific information.\n\nA good portfolio shows not just what you built, but how your thinking evolved throughout the project.\n\n### [h3] Evidence Collection and Organization\nCollecting and organizing evidence of your design process helps prove what you did and why you made certain decisions. Here are effective techniques for gathering evidence:\n\n1. Take \"before and after\" photos whenever you make significant changes to your robot.\n\n2. Record short video clips of your robot in action, especially during testing.\n\n3. Keep all versions of your programming code, not just the final version.\n\n4. Create data tables to record test results. For example:\n   - Test #1: Robot speed on smooth surface = 10 inches/second\n   - Test #2: Robot speed on rough surface = 7 inches/second\n\n5. Save failed designs and explain why they didn't work. Learning from mistakes is an important part of the design process!\n\n6. Use a consistent naming system for all files and documents (for example: \"LineFollower_Test3_April15.mp4\").\n\nOrganize your evidence by design phase (planning, building, testing, etc.) or by robot component (structure, sensors, programming, etc.). Choose the system that makes the most sense for your project.\n\n### [h3] Presentation Techniques\nPresenting your robot design effectively helps others understand and appreciate your work. Here are strategies for creating engaging presentations:\n\n1. Start with a clear introduction that explains the challenge and why it matters.\n\n2. Use visual aids like photos, videos, and diagrams to show your robot and how it works.\n\n3. Tell a story about your design process, including:\n   - The problem you were trying to solve\n   - Challenges you faced along the way\n   - \"Aha moments\" when you figured something out\n   - How you tested and improved your design\n\n4. Demonstrate your robot in action if possible. If not, show video of it working.\n\n5. Explain what you learned and what you would do differently next time.\n\n6. Keep your presentation organized and focused on the most important points.\n\n7. Practice your presentation beforehand so you can speak confidently.\n\nRemember that a good presentation doesn't just show that your robot works - it shows your understanding of the design process and the decisions you made along the way.\n\n## [h2] **Activity 2: Design Portfolio Planning**\nCreate a template for your design portfolio that will document each phase of your robot challenge project. Include sections for the problem statement, research findings, initial designs, testing results, iterations, and final solution. Explain how you will collect evidence for each section and what format this documentation will take (sketches, photographs, video recordings, data logs, etc.).\n## [h2] Reflection and Evaluation\nAfter completing your robot design, it's important to step back and think about what went well, what could be improved, and what you learned from the process. Evaluation helps you become a better designer for future projects.\n\nRemember that even professional engineers rarely get everything perfect on the first try!\n\n### [h3] Self-Assessment Methods\nSelf-assessment means honestly evaluating your own work. Here are effective approaches for assessing your robot design:\n\n1. Requirements checklist: Create a list of all the requirements from your original problem statement. Go through each one and mark whether your robot fully meets it, partially meets it, or doesn't meet it.\n\n2. Success criteria evaluation: Test your robot against each of your success criteria and rate how well it performed on a scale (for example, 1-5 stars).\n\n3. Design journal review: Look back through your notes and documentation. Identify key decisions you made and evaluate whether they were good choices.\n\n4. Strengths and weaknesses analysis: Make a two-column list with \"What Worked Well\" and \"What Could Be Improved\" for different aspects of your robot (structure, programming, sensors, etc.).\n\n5. Learning reflection: Write down the three most important things you learned during this project and how you'll apply them in future designs.\n\nBe honest in your self-assessment. The goal isn't to prove your robot is perfect, but to understand what you did well and what you could do better next time.\n\n### [h3] Peer Review Processes\nGetting feedback from others is a valuable way to improve your design. Here are structured methods for peer review:\n\n1. Guided demonstration: Show your robot to someone else and explain how it works. Ask specific questions like \"Is the purpose of my robot clear?\" or \"Does the movement seem smooth?\"\n\n2. Feedback forms: Create a simple form with questions about different aspects of your robot. Ask reviewers to rate each aspect and provide comments.\n\n3. \"I like, I wish, I wonder\" format: Ask reviewers to share:\n   - Something they like about your design\n   - Something they wish was different or better\n   - Something they wonder or are curious about\n\n4. Expert consultation: If possible, show your robot to someone with experience in robotics or engineering and ask for specific technical feedback.\n\nWhen receiving feedback, listen carefully without getting defensive. Not all suggestions will be helpful, but consider each one before deciding whether to make changes.\n\n### [h3] Future Improvement Identification\nEvery design can be improved, and identifying potential enhancements is an important part of the engineering process. Here are techniques for identifying future improvements:\n\n1. Performance gap analysis: Compare your robot's actual performance to your ideal goals. Where are the biggest differences? These areas are prime candidates for improvement.\n\n2. \"If only...\" brainstorming: Complete the sentence \"This robot would be better if only...\" in as many ways as possible. Don't worry about whether the improvements are practical at this stage.\n\n3. Constraint removal: Think about which limitations affected your design (time, materials, knowledge, etc.). How would you improve your robot if those constraints were removed?\n\n4. Next version planning: Sketch or describe \"Version 2.0\" of your robot with specific improvements. Be as detailed as possible about what would change and why.\n\n5. Technology watch: Research newer technologies or techniques that could improve your design in the future.\n\n6. Improvement priority matrix: Create a simple chart to help decide which improvements to make first:\n   - Draw a grid with four boxes\n   - Label the top \"High Impact\" and the bottom \"Low Impact\"\n   - Label the left side \"Easy to Do\" and the right side \"Hard to Do\"\n   - Place each possible improvement in the appropriate box\n   - Focus first on improvements that are \"High Impact\" and \"Easy to Do\"\n\nThis helps you make smart choices about which improvements will give you the biggest benefits for the least effort.\n\nRemember that identifying future improvements doesn't mean your current design is bad - it shows that you understand the ongoing nature of the engineering design process.\n\n## [h2] Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider what aspects of your final",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

  "response": "# 7.5\n# Robot Design Challenges\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Apply the complete engineering design process to solve a specific robot challenge\n- Document each step of the design process using appropriate templates and evidence\n- Evaluate the effectiveness of robot solutions against original problem statements and requirements\n### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Applying the Engineering Design Process to Robotics Challenges\nThis podcast explores how the engineering design process provides a structured framework for approaching complex robot challenges, from initial problem definition to final solution evaluation.\n## Challenge Selection and Analysis\n\nWhen engineers build robots, they start by understanding the problem they need to solve. In this section, we'll look at different robot challenges you can choose from to practice the engineering design process.\n\nEach challenge requires different robot capabilities, so you'll need to think carefully about what your robot needs to do. Remember that a well-defined problem makes finding a solution much easier!\n\n### Line-Following Challenge\n\nA line-following robot needs to track and follow a line drawn on the ground. This challenge tests your robot's ability to \"see\" using light sensors and make quick decisions about direction.\n\nYour robot will need sensors to detect the difference between the line (usually black) and the background (usually white). The robot must stay on the line even when it curves or makes sharp turns. You'll need to program your robot to adjust its wheels or motors based on what the sensors detect.\n\nSuccess in this challenge means your robot can follow the entire line without losing track or going off course. This is similar to how self-driving cars follow lane markings on roads!\n\n### Obstacle Course Challenge\n\nIn the obstacle course challenge, your robot must navigate through a path with various barriers and terrain changes. This tests your robot's ability to sense its environment and make decisions about how to move safely.\n\nYour robot might need to go around walls, climb small ramps, or squeeze through narrow passages. You'll need to think about what sensors your robot needs (like distance sensors or touch sensors) and how to program it to respond when it detects an obstacle.\n\nThis challenge is similar to how robots in warehouses or on other planets need to move around without bumping into things or getting stuck.\n\n### Object Sorting Challenge\n\nThe object sorting challenge asks your robot to identify different objects and sort them into the correct categories. For example, your robot might need to separate blue blocks from red blocks, or put small objects in one pile and large objects in another.\n\nYour robot will need sensors to detect color, size, or shape. It will also need a way to pick up and move objects, like a gripper arm or scoop. You'll program your robot to make decisions based on what it senses and then take action to sort each object correctly.\n\nThis challenge is similar to how recycling robots sort different materials or how factory robots organize products.\n\n### Custom Challenge Design\n\nIf you have your own robot challenge idea, you can create a custom challenge! The key is to clearly define what problem your robot will solve and how you'll know if it succeeds.\n\nWhen designing your own challenge, think about:\n- What specific task will your robot perform?\n- What environment will it operate in?\n- What would count as success?\n- What limitations or rules should apply?\n\nCreating your own challenge lets you focus on problems that interest you most, whether that's a robot that can play a simple game, care for a plant, or solve another problem you've identified.\n\n## **Activity 1: Challenge Selection and Problem Definition**\n\nSelect one of the robot challenges presented (or design your own) and develop a comprehensive problem statement. Define the specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria for your chosen challenge. Create a simple diagram illustrating the challenge environment and key elements your robot must interact with.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Planning and Design Application\n\nOnce you've selected your challenge and defined the problem, it's time to create a detailed plan for your robot. Good planning saves time and helps you avoid problems later in the design process.\n\nThink of this stage like drawing a blueprint before building a house - you want to work out all the details on paper before you start building!\n\n### Creating Comprehensive Challenge Plans\n\nA good robot design plan includes details about all the parts of your robot and why you chose them. Start by sketching what your robot will look like from different angles. Label all the important parts.\n\nFor each component of your robot, explain:\n- What it does (its function)\n- Why you chose it (your reasoning)\n- How it connects to other parts\n\nFor example, if you're building a line-following robot, your plan might include:\n- Two motors: To control the wheels independently so the robot can turn\n- Light sensors: To detect the line on the ground\n- A controller board: To run your program and connect all parts\n- Wheels: To move the robot smoothly on the surface\n\nInclude measurements and specific details whenever possible. This makes it easier to build exactly what you planned.\n\n### Setting Success Criteria\n\nSuccess criteria are specific goals that help you know if your robot works well. These should be measurable and directly related to your challenge.\n\nGood success criteria answer the question: \"How will I know if my robot is successful?\"\n\nFor example, success criteria for a line-following robot might include:\n- The robot follows the entire line without going off track\n- The robot completes the course in less than 2 minutes\n- The robot can handle curves with at least a 4-inch radius\n- The robot can recover if it briefly loses the line\n\nWrite down your success criteria before you start building. This gives you clear targets to aim for and helps you test your robot fairly.\n\n### Project Management Approaches\n\nManaging your robot project means organizing your time, materials, and tasks effectively. Even professional engineers use project management tools to stay organized!\n\nHere are some strategies to help manage your robot design project:\n\n1. Create a timeline with specific deadlines for each stage:\n   - Research and planning: 2 days\n   - Building the robot: 3 days\n   - Programming: 2 days\n   - Testing and improvements: 3 days\n\n2. Make a materials list with everything you'll need before you start building.\n\n3. Break down big tasks into smaller steps. Instead of \"build robot,\" list steps like \"attach wheels to motors\" and \"connect sensors to controller.\"\n\n4. Keep a project journal where you record what you did each day, problems you faced, and how you solved them.\n\nUsing these project management approaches will help you stay organized and make steady progress toward completing your robot challenge.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Reflect on how your understanding of robot design challenges has evolved since beginning this course. How has your approach to defining problems and establishing criteria changed?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n## Implementation and Testing Strategies\n\nNow it's time to build and test your robot design! This is where your plans come to life, but it's also where you'll discover things that need to be fixed or improved.\n\nRemember that testing is not just something you do at the end - it should happen throughout the building process to catch problems early.\n\n### Resources and Materials Management\n\nManaging your resources and materials effectively is crucial for a successful robot project. Here's how to do it well:\n\n1. Create a complete inventory of all parts and materials you need before starting. Group them by category (electronics, structural parts, tools, etc.).\n\n2. Check what materials you already have and what you need to get. Sometimes you can substitute one material for another if needed.\n\n3. Set up a clean, organized workspace with enough room to build and test your robot. Keep similar items together and label containers if possible.\n\n4. Handle delicate components with care. For example, electronic parts can be damaged by static electricity, and some sensors need to be kept clean.\n\n5. Reuse and recycle materials when possible. Many robot parts can be taken apart and used in future projects.\n\nGood resource management means you won't waste time looking for parts or run out of essential materials halfway through your project.\n\n### Timeline Development\n\nCreating a realistic timeline helps you complete your robot project on schedule. Here's how to develop an effective timeline:\n\n1. Start with the final deadline and work backward.\n\n2. Divide your project into phases:\n   - Planning phase: Research and design (20% of total time)\n   - Building phase: Constructing the physical robot (30% of total time)\n   - Programming phase: Writing and testing code (20% of total time)\n   - Testing phase: Evaluating and improving (20% of total time)\n   - Documentation phase: Recording your process (10% of total time)\n\n3. Set specific milestones to check your progress. For example:\n   - Day 3: Complete robot chassis construction\n   - Day 5: Finish basic movement programming\n   - Day 7: Robot successfully completes basic version of challenge\n\n4. Include buffer time for unexpected problems. Things almost always take longer than expected!\n\n5. Create a visual timeline chart and keep it visible in your workspace to stay on track.\n\nRemember that your timeline might need adjustments as you work, and that's okay. The goal is to have a plan that helps you manage your time effectively.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### Collaborative Testing Approaches\n\nEven if you're working alone, you can use collaborative testing approaches to improve your robot design. These methods help you find and fix problems more effectively:\n\n1. \"Fresh eyes\" testing: Ask someone who hasn't seen your robot before to try using it or watching it perform. They might notice issues you've missed.\n\n2. Role-playing: Take on different roles yourself - be the builder, then the tester, then the user. Each perspective helps you see different aspects of your design.\n\n3. Structured testing protocols:\n   - Function testing: Test each part of your robot separately before testing the whole system\n   - Boundary testing: Try the extreme conditions (fastest speed, tightest turns, etc.)\n   - Failure testing: Intentionally create problems to see how your robot handles them\n\n4. Document all test results, including:\n   - What you tested\n   - How you tested it\n   - What worked well\n   - What problems you found\n   - How you fixed the problems\n\nGood testing is systematic and thorough. Don't just check if your robot works in ideal conditions - test it in all the conditions it might face during the challenge.\n\n## Documentation and Presentation\n\nDocumenting your robot design process is just as important as building the robot itself! Good documentation helps you track your progress, remember what you did, and share your work with others.\n\nThink of documentation as telling the story of your robot - from the first idea to the final design.\n\n### Design Portfolio Development\n\nA design portfolio is a collection of materials that shows your entire robot design journey. It's like a scrapbook of your project that helps others understand what you did and why.\n\nYour portfolio should include:\n\n1. The problem statement and requirements for your robot challenge\n2. Research you did before starting (including any similar robots you looked at)\n3. Sketches and diagrams of your initial design ideas\n4. Final design plans with detailed explanations\n5. Photos or drawings of your robot at different stages of construction\n6. Programming code with comments explaining how it works\n7. Test results and data you collected\n8. Changes you made based on testing\n9. Final evaluation of how well your robot met the requirements\n\nOrganize your portfolio in chronological order, from beginning to end. Use dividers or sections with clear labels to make it easy to find specific information.\n\nA good portfolio shows not just what you built, but how your thinking evolved throughout the project.\n\n### Evidence Collection and Organization\n\nCollecting and organizing evidence of your design process helps prove what you did and why you made certain decisions. Here are effective techniques for gathering evidence:\n\n1. Take \"before and after\" photos whenever you make significant changes to your robot.\n\n2. Record short video clips of your robot in action, especially during testing.\n\n3. Keep all versions of your programming code, not just the final version.\n\n4. Create data tables to record test results. For example:\n   - Test #1: Robot speed on smooth surface = 10 inches/second\n   - Test #2: Robot speed on rough surface = 7 inches/second\n\n5. Save failed designs and explain why they didn't work. Learning from mistakes is an important part of the design process!\n\n6. Use a consistent naming system for all files and documents (for example: \"LineFollower_Test3_April15.mp4\").\n\nOrganize your evidence by design phase (planning, building, testing, etc.) or by robot component (structure, sensors, programming, etc.). Choose the system that makes the most sense for your project.\n\n### Presentation Techniques\n\nPresenting your robot design effectively helps others understand and appreciate your work. Here are strategies for creating engaging presentations:\n\n1. Start with a clear introduction that explains the challenge and why it matters.\n\n2. Use visual aids like photos, videos, and diagrams to show your robot and how it works.\n\n3. Tell a story about your design process, including:\n   - The problem you were trying to solve\n   - Challenges you faced along the way\n   - \"Aha moments\" when you figured something out\n   - How you tested and improved your design\n\n4. Demonstrate your robot in action if possible. If not, show video of it working.\n\n5. Explain what you learned and what you would do differently next time.\n\n6. Keep your presentation organized and focused on the most important points.\n\n7. Practice your presentation beforehand so you can speak confidently.\n\nRemember that a good presentation doesn't just show that your robot works - it shows your understanding of the design process and the decisions you made along the way.\n\n## **Activity 2: Design Portfolio Planning**\n\nCreate a template for your design portfolio that will document each phase of your robot challenge project. Include sections for the problem statement, research findings, initial designs, testing results, iterations, and final solution. Explain how you will collect evidence for each section and what format this documentation will take (sketches, photographs, video recordings, data logs, etc.).\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Reflection and Evaluation\n\nAfter completing your robot design, it's important to step back and think about what went well, what could be improved, and what you learned from the process. Evaluation helps you become a better designer for future projects.\n\nRemember that even professional engineers rarely get everything perfect on the first try!\n\n### Self-Assessment Methods\n\nSelf-assessment means honestly evaluating your own work. Here are effective approaches for assessing your robot design:\n\n1. Requirements checklist: Create a list of all the requirements from your original problem statement. Go through each one and mark whether your robot fully meets it, partially meets it, or doesn't meet it.\n\n2. Success criteria evaluation: Test your robot against each of your success criteria and rate how well it performed on a scale (for example, 1-5 stars).\n\n3. Design journal review: Look back through your notes and documentation. Identify key decisions you made and evaluate whether they were good choices.\n\n4. Strengths and weaknesses analysis: Make a two-column list with \"What Worked Well\" and \"What Could Be Improved\" for different aspects of your robot (structure, programming, sensors, etc.).\n\n5. Learning reflection: Write down the three most important things you learned during this project and how you'll apply them in future designs.\n\nBe honest in your self-assessment. The goal isn't to prove your robot is perfect, but to understand what you did well and what you could do better next time.\n\n### Peer Review Processes\n\nGetting feedback from others is a valuable way to improve your design. Here are structured methods for peer review:\n\n1. Guided demonstration: Show your robot to someone else and explain how it works. Ask specific questions like \"Is the purpose of my robot clear?\" or \"Does the movement seem smooth?\"\n\n2. Feedback forms: Create a simple form with questions about different aspects of your robot. Ask reviewers to rate each aspect and provide comments.\n\n3. \"I like, I wish, I wonder\" format: Ask reviewers to share:\n   - Something they like about your design\n   - Something they wish was different or better\n   - Something they wonder or are curious about\n\n4. Expert consultation: If possible, show your robot to someone with experience in robotics or engineering and ask for specific technical feedback.\n\nWhen receiving feedback, listen carefully without getting defensive. Not all suggestions will be helpful, but consider each one before deciding whether to make changes.\n\n### Future Improvement Identification\n\nEvery design can be improved, and identifying potential enhancements is an important part of the engineering process. Here are techniques for identifying future improvements:\n\n1. Performance gap analysis: Compare your robot's actual performance to your ideal goals. Where are the biggest differences? These areas are prime candidates for improvement.\n\n2. \"If only...\" brainstorming: Complete the sentence \"This robot would be better if only...\" in as many ways as possible. Don't worry about whether the improvements are practical at this stage.\n\n3. Constraint removal: Think about which limitations affected your design (time, materials, knowledge, etc.). How would you improve your robot if those constraints were removed?\n\n4. Next version planning: Sketch or describe \"Version 2.0\" of your robot with specific improvements. Be as detailed as possible about what would change and why.\n\n5. Technology watch: Research newer technologies or techniques that could improve your design in the future.\n\n6. Improvement priority matrix: Create a simple chart to help decide which improvements to make first:\n   - Draw a grid with four boxes\n   - Label the top \"High Impact\" and the bottom \"Low Impact\"\n   - Label the left side \"Easy to Do\" and the right side \"Hard to Do\"\n   - Place each possible improvement in the appropriate box\n   - Focus first on improvements that are \"High Impact\" and \"Easy to Do\"\n\nThis helps you make smart choices about which improvements will give you the biggest benefits for the least effort.\n\nRemember that identifying future improvements doesn't mean your current design is bad - it shows that you understand the ongoing nature of the engineering design process.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider what aspects of your final\n---stopandreflectEND---"
