Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for proper HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n### 3. Page Break Markers\n\nInsert `---pagebreak---` markers at logical page breaks in the document where it makes sense for PDF printing.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics\nThis chapter covers the basic concepts of robotics, including definitions, history, and key components.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Chapter 2: Robot Sensors\nThis chapter explores the various types of sensors used in robotics.\n```\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\nNote that each question and each answer option MUST be separated by an empty line for proper HTML rendering.\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Identify major section transitions where a page break would be appropriate\n2. Focus on these key locations:\n   - Between major sections or chapters\n   - After complete topic areas\n   - Where content naturally transitions to a new concept\n   - Before or after large diagrams or image descriptions\n3. Use page breaks sparingly - when in doubt, use fewer page breaks\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense for printing\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

Most educational robots support a standard set of basic movement instructions that serve as building blocks for more complex behaviors.\n\n### Core Movement Commands\nThe most common movement commands include:\n\n- **forward(distance)**: Moves the robot forward by the specified distance\n- **backward(distance)**: Moves the robot backward by the specified distance  \n- **left(degrees)**: Rotates the robot left by the specified number of degrees\n- **right(degrees)**: Rotates the robot right by the specified number of degrees\n- **wait(seconds)**: Pauses the robot's execution for the specified number of seconds\n\nThese commands may look slightly different depending on your programming environment, but the concepts remain the same. For example, in some environments you might see `move(100)` instead of `forward(100)`, or `turn(-90)` instead of `left(90)`.\n\n## Creating Movement Patterns\nMovement patterns are sequences of commands that create specific paths or behaviors. By combining basic movement commands in the right order, we can create precise movement patterns for our robots.\n\n### Simple Patterns\nLet's look at some common movement patterns:\n\n**Line pattern:**\n\n```\nforward(100)\nwait(1)\nbackward(100)\n```\n\n**Square pattern:**\n\n```\nforward(100)\nleft(90)\nforward(100)\nleft(90)\nforward(100)\nleft(90)\nforward(100)\nleft(90)\n```\n\n**Triangle pattern:**\n\n```\nforward(100)\nleft(120)\nforward(100)\nleft(120)\nforward(100)\nleft(120)\n```\n\nNotice how these patterns use repetition of simple commands to create recognizable shapes. The key is understanding how the sequence affects the robot's path.\n\n### Real-World Movement Applications\n\nThink about how robots move in different environments. A robot vacuum needs to move differently on carpet versus tile floors. On carpet, it might need to move more slowly and use more power. On tile, it can move faster but needs to be careful not to slip. The same basic movement commands are used, but how they're combined changes based on the surface.\n\nSimilarly, a school security robot might patrol hallways using these movement patterns:\n\n```\n# Patrol a hallway\nforward(500)  # Move down the hall\nwait(5)       # Pause to scan the area\nbackward(500) # Return to starting point\n```\n\nThis simple pattern helps the robot monitor a specific area before returning to its starting position.\n\n## **Activity 1: Program a Virtual Robot Path**\nUsing the virtual robot simulator provided in the course resources, create a program that makes the robot draw a rectangle. Your rectangle should have sides with a 2:1 ratio (longer sides should be twice the length of shorter sides). Start by planning your command sequence on paper, then implement it in the simulator. How many commands did you need? Did your robot end up facing the same direction it started?\n\n## Combining Multiple Movements\nMore complex robot behaviors require combining different types of movement patterns. By nesting patterns within each other or creating functions for reusable movements, we can build sophisticated robot behaviors.\n\n### Creating Functions for Reusable Movements\nRather than repeating the same sequence of commands multiple times, we can define functions that perform specific movement patterns:\n\n```\nfunction square(size) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n    forward(size)\n    left(90)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction zigzag(length, height, count) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    forward(length)\n    right(90)\n    forward(height)\n    left(90)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy creating these reusable functions, we can simplify our main program:\n\n```\nsquare(100)\nforward(50)\nzigzag(50, 25, 3)\n```\n\nThis approach makes our code more readable and easier to modify.\n\n### Complex Movement Examples\n\nLet's look at how we can combine basic movements to create more interesting robot behaviors:\n\n**Line-following robot:**\n```\nwhile (sensor.detectsLine()) {\n  if (sensor.lineIsLeft()) {\n    left(10)  // Small correction to the left\n  } else if (sensor.lineIsRight()) {\n    right(10) // Small correction to the right\n  } else {\n    forward(20) // Move forward when centered on the line\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Obstacle-avoiding robot:**\n```\nfunction avoidObstacle() {\n  backward(20)    // Back up a bit\n  left(90)        // Turn left\n  forward(50)     // Move forward to go around obstacle\n  right(90)       // Turn right\n  forward(50)     // Move forward past the obstacle\n  right(90)       // Turn right again\n  forward(50)     // Return to original path\n  left(90)        // Face original direction\n}\n\n// Main program\nwhile (true) {\n  if (sensor.detectsObstacle()) {\n    avoidObstacle()\n  } else {\n    forward(20)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese examples show how the same basic movement commands can be combined in different ways to create robots that can follow lines or navigate around obstacles.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the relationship between the code you write and the physical movement of the robot. How does understanding this connection help you write better movement programs?\n\n## Testing and Fixing Movement Programs\nEven well-planned robot movement programs often don't work perfectly the first time. Learning to identify and fix issues in your movement programs is an essential robotics programming skill.\n\n### Common Movement Errors\nSome typical errors in movement programs include:\n\n1. **Incorrect distances or angles**: The robot doesn't move the intended distance or turn the correct angle\n2. **Sequence errors**: Commands are executed in the wrong order\n3. **Missing commands**: A required movement is omitted from the sequence\n4. **Timing issues**: The robot executes commands too quickly or with improper delays\n\n### Debugging Process\nWhen your robot doesn't move as expected, follow this debugging process:\n\n1. **Observe**: Watch the robot's actual behavior compared to what you expected\n2. **Identify**: Determine where the deviation from expected behavior occurs\n3. **Hypothesize**: Formulate a theory about what's causing the problem\n4. **Test**: Make a single change to your program and observe the result\n5. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the robot behaves as expected\n\nFor example, if your robot should make a square but instead makes an odd shape, you might:\n- Check your turn angles (are they exactly 90 degrees?)\n- Verify movement distances (are all sides the same length?)\n- Confirm the sequence has the correct number of movements (four sides require four forward commands and four turns)\n\n### Debugging Example: School Robot Gone Wrong\n\nImagine programming a robot to deliver items between classrooms. Your program should make the robot:\n1. Leave the office\n2. Turn right down the hallway\n3. Go to the third classroom\n4. Turn left into the classroom\n5. Deliver the item\n6. Return to the office\n\nBut instead, your robot keeps going past the third classroom! Here's how you might debug:\n\n1. **Observe**: The robot passes the third classroom without stopping\n2. **Identify**: The robot isn't counting classrooms correctly\n3. **Hypothesize**: Maybe the distance between classrooms varies\n4. **Test**: Change the program to use door sensors instead of fixed distances\n5. **Repeat**: Test the new program and adjust as needed\n\nThis real-world example shows how the same debugging process applies to more complex robot tasks.\n\n### **Check your understanding**\nIf a robot needs to travel from point A to point B, then return to point A following a different path, what sequence elements are essential in your program?\n\nA. The robot must first determine its current location before starting movement\nB. The program must include at least one wait command between movements\nC. The sequence must use the same movement distances going and returning\nD. The program must include different command sequences for the outbound and return journeys\n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\nThe correct answer is D. The program must include different command sequences for the outbound and return journeys. Since the robot needs to follow a different path on the return journey, the program must contain distinct command sequences for each part of the journey. If you chose a different answer, remember that robots follow commands literally - to take different paths, you must provide different instructions for each path.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a time when your robot movement program didn't work as expected. What specific debugging steps did you take to identify and fix the problem? What did this experience teach you about the importance of testing in robotics programming?\n\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nSequencer game: \"Path Programmer\" - Students are shown a maze with a start and end point. They must arrange movement commands (forward, backward, left, right) in the correct sequence to navigate the robot through the maze. As levels increase, the maze complexity increases, requiring more precise sequencing and the use of compound movements or repeated patterns to solve efficiently.\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",

Transform \"Check Your Understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use everyday language familiar to 11-12 year olds, limit sentence length, and avoid jargon. It should also include frequent headings, visual elements, and engagement strategies to support the target learner's needs.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, which means there are no opportunities for peer interaction or real-time feedback. The formatting and structure of the content must be optimized for effective self-paced learning without an instructor present.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content.\n- Address the specific formatting requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt.\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to suit the target learner profile.\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online learning medium.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Identify key terms, headers, and important concept labels, and apply bold formatting using markdown's double asterisks.\n2. Ensure proper paragraph breaks by adding exactly one empty line between paragraphs.\n3. Strategically insert `---pagebreak---` markers at logical transition points in the content.\n4. Format all \"Stop and Reflect\" sections by adding the `---stopandreflect---` and `---stopandreflectEND---` markers.\n5. Transform \"Check Your Understanding\" sections by adding the appropriate opening, answer, and closing markers.\n6. Review the content to ensure all transformations are applied consistently and without disrupting the original structure or intent.\n\nThe enhanced content should maintain the educational value while improving readability, engagement, and alignment with the target learner's needs and the limitations of the asynchronous online delivery medium."
