Understanding the common types of errors helps you identify and fix them more efficiently. There are three main categories of programming errors:\n\n### Syntax Errors\nThese are spelling and grammar mistakes in your code. Just like a sentence needs proper punctuation and structure in English, programming languages have specific rules for how commands must be written. Examples include:\n- Missing brackets or parentheses\n- Misspelled commands\n- Missing semicolons or other required punctuation\n\nThe good news is that most programming environments will detect these errors immediately and highlight them for you.\n\n### Logic Errors\nLogic errors occur when your code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results. The syntax is correct, but your instructions don't accomplish what you intended. These are often the most challenging errors to find because the program appears to work. Examples include:\n- Using the wrong formula in a calculation\n- Creating an infinite loop\n- Testing conditions in the wrong order\n\nIn robotics, a common logic error might be telling your robot to turn right when it should turn left, or setting a sensor threshold too high or too low, causing your robot to miss important information.\n\n### Runtime Errors\nRuntime errors happen when your program encounters a problem while running. These errors cause your program to crash or stop executing. Examples include:\n- Dividing by zero\n- Referring to variables that don't exist\n- Trying to perform operations on incompatible data types\n\nFor robots, runtime errors might occur when your program tries to access a sensor that isn't connected or when your robot attempts a movement that's physically impossible.\n\n## The Debugging Process\nDebugging is a systematic process, not random guesswork. Following these steps will help you find and fix errors efficiently:\n\n### Step 1: Reproduce the Problem\nThe first step in fixing any bug is being able to make it happen consistently. Try to identify the specific conditions that cause the error to occur.\n\nFor example, if your robot only turns incorrectly when approaching a wall at a certain angle, you'll need to recreate that specific scenario to properly debug the issue.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Expected vs. Actual Behavior\nClearly define what you expected to happen and what actually happened instead. This gap is the essence of your bug.\n\nFor instance: \"I expected the robot to stop when it detected an object 10cm away, but it continues moving until it bumps into the object.\"\n\n### Step 3: Locate the Source of the Error\nNarrow down where in your code the problem might be occurring. For larger programs, you can use techniques like:\n- Print statements to show values at different points in your code\n- Commenting out sections to see if the error disappears\n- Working backwards from where the incorrect behavior appears\n\nIn robotics programming, it's helpful to check:\n- Sensor readings (are they giving accurate values?)\n- Motor commands (are they receiving the correct instructions?)\n- Decision logic (are your if/then statements evaluating correctly?)\n\n### Step 4: Fix the Error and Test\nMake a single, focused change that you believe will fix the issue. Then test your program again to see if the error is resolved. If you make multiple changes at once, you won't know which one actually fixed the problem.\n\n## Activity 1: Bug Detective\n\n**Activity 1: Find the Bugs**\n\nReview the following simple robot movement program that contains three different types of errors. Identify what type each error is (syntax, logic, or runtime) and how you would fix it:\n\n\nfunction moveRobot() {\n  forward(10);\n  turn(90)\n  forward(5;\n  if (sensorValue > 50) {\n    backwards(10);\n  }\n  turn(45);\n  while (true) {\n    forward(1);\n  }\n}\n\n\nTry to find all three errors before checking the solution in your course materials!\n\n## Testing with Different Scenarios\nThorough testing is crucial for creating reliable programs. It's important to test your code with various inputs and situations.\n\n### Input Testing\nAlways test your program with:\n- Normal expected values\n- Boundary values (minimum and maximum allowed)\n- Invalid inputs (what happens if a user enters text when a number is expected?)\n\nFor a robot that follows a line, you might test:\n- Normal conditions: robot on a clear, dark line against a light background\n- Boundary conditions: robot on a faded line or a line with varying thickness\n- Invalid conditions: robot on a surface with multiple lines or no line at all\n\n### Edge Cases\nEdge cases are unusual but possible scenarios that might cause problems:\n- What if a sensor returns zero?\n- What if your robot reaches a physical barrier?\n- What if the battery is low?\n\nFor example, if you're programming a robot to navigate a maze, edge cases might include:\n- Dead ends that require the robot to turn around completely\n- Very narrow passages that might cause sensor confusion\n- Highly reflective surfaces that interfere with distance sensors\n\n### Incremental Testing\nInstead of writing a large program and then testing it all at once:\n1. Write a small piece of functionality\n2. Test it thoroughly\n3. Only when it works correctly, add the next feature\n4. Repeat\n\nThis approach makes it much easier to identify where errors occur.\n\nFor example, when programming a robot to pick up objects:\n1. First, test just the movement toward the object\n2. Then, test the gripper mechanism separately\n3. Next, test the combination of movement and gripping\n4. Finally, test the complete sequence including returning the object to a designated location\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you encountered a problem that required systematic troubleshooting (with technology, a game, or anything else). How did breaking down the problem help you solve it more effectively than random attempts?\n\n## Improving Your Programs\nDebugging isn't just about fixing errorsâ€”it's also an opportunity to improve your code.\n\n### Refactoring for Clarity\nAfter fixing bugs, look for ways to make your code clearer and more maintainable:\n- Use meaningful variable and function names\n- Break long functions into smaller, focused ones\n- Add comments explaining complex sections\n\nFor example, instead of using a variable name like \"s1\" for a sensor, use \"distanceSensor\" to make your code easier to understand.\n\n### Performance Optimization\nOnce your program works correctly, you might want to make it run more efficiently:\n- Remove unnecessary steps\n- Look for repeated code that could be turned into a function\n- Consider whether there are more efficient algorithms\n\nIn robotics, efficient code can save battery power and make your robot respond more quickly to its environment.\n\n### Documentation\nGood documentation helps you and others understand your code later:\n- Explain what your program does\n- Document any assumptions or limitations\n- Note any special cases or considerations\n\nFor example, document that your line-following robot works best on high-contrast surfaces or that your obstacle-avoidance program expects objects to be at least 5cm tall to be detected reliably.\n\n## Creating a Robotics Test Plan\n\nWhen testing robot programs, it helps to create a simple test plan. Here's an example for a line-following robot:\n\n1. **Basic Functionality Test**\n   - Does the robot follow a straight line?\n   - Does it follow a curved line?\n   \n2. **Sensor Test**\n   - Do all sensors detect the line correctly?\n   - What happens when sensors are partially on/off the line?\n   \n3. **Environmental Test**\n   - Does the program work in different lighting conditions?\n   - Does it work on different surfaces?\n   \n4. **Edge Case Test**\n   - What happens at intersections?\n   - What happens if the line ends?\n   - What happens if the robot loses the line?\n\nHaving a structured test plan helps ensure your robot will work reliably in real-world conditions, not just in ideal situations.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider your debugging process. Do you tend to make random changes hoping the problem will go away, or do you approach debugging systematically? How might adopting a more methodical approach improve your programming experience?\n\n### Check your understanding\nWhat is the first step in debugging a program that isn't working?\nA. Start over with a new program\nB. Ask someone else to fix it\nC. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen\nD. Add more code to fix the problem\n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen. Effective debugging starts with clearly understanding the problem by identifying the difference between the current behavior and the expected behavior. If you chose a different answer, remember that debugging is about methodical problem-solving rather than blind fixes or starting over. Understanding the problem is always the first step to solving it.\n\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nDebug challenge game: Players are presented with a series of increasingly complex robot programs containing different types of errors. They must identify the specific error type (syntax, logic, or runtime) and select the correct fix from multiple options. For example, a simple robot navigation program might have a missing semicolon (syntax error), an incorrect turning angle (logic error), or a division by zero when calculating speed (runtime error). Players earn points based on speed and accuracy of their debugging.\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for proper HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n### 3. Page Break Markers\n\nInsert `---pagebreak---` markers at logical page breaks in the document where it makes sense for PDF printing.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics\nThis chapter covers the basic concepts of robotics, including definitions, history, and key components.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Chapter 2: Robot Sensors\nThis chapter explores the various types of sensors used in robotics.\n```\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\nNote that each question and each answer option MUST be separated by an empty line for proper HTML rendering.\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Identify major section transitions where a page break would be appropriate\n2. Focus on these key locations:\n   - Between major sections or chapters\n   - After complete topic areas\n   - Where content naturally transitions to a new concept\n   - Before or after large diagrams or image descriptions\n3. Use page breaks sparingly - when in doubt, use fewer page breaks\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense for printing\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance.\nAnother misconception is that all robots are autonomous. In reality, many robots require continuous human control and are not capable of making decisions on their own.\n\n## Types of Robot Control Systems\nThere are several methods for controlling robots, from direct manual control to fully autonomous operation.\n```\n\n**Transformed:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

Understanding the common types of errors helps you identify and fix them more efficiently. There are three main categories of programming errors:\n\n### **Syntax Errors**\n\nThese are spelling and grammar mistakes in your code. Just like a sentence needs proper punctuation and structure in English, programming languages have specific rules for how commands must be written. Examples include:\n- Missing brackets or parentheses\n- Misspelled commands\n- Missing semicolons or other required punctuation\n\nThe good news is that most programming environments will detect these errors immediately and highlight them for you.\n\n### **Logic Errors**\n\nLogic errors occur when your code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results. The syntax is correct, but your instructions don't accomplish what you intended. These are often the most challenging errors to find because the program appears to work. Examples include:\n- Using the wrong formula in a calculation\n- Creating an infinite loop\n- Testing conditions in the wrong order\n\nIn robotics, a common logic error might be telling your robot to turn right when it should turn left, or setting a sensor threshold too high or too low, causing your robot to miss important information.\n\n### **Runtime Errors**\n\nRuntime errors happen when your program encounters a problem while running. These errors cause your program to crash or stop executing. Examples include:\n- Dividing by zero\n- Referring to variables that don't exist\n- Trying to perform operations on incompatible data types\n\nFor robots, runtime errors might occur when your program tries to access a sensor that isn't connected or when your robot attempts a movement that's physically impossible.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **The Debugging Process**\n\nDebugging is a systematic process, not random guesswork. Following these steps will help you find and fix errors efficiently:\n\n### **Step 1: Reproduce the Problem**\n\nThe first step in fixing any bug is being able to make it happen consistently. Try to identify the specific conditions that cause the error to occur.\n\nFor example, if your robot only turns incorrectly when approaching a wall at a certain angle, you'll need to recreate that specific scenario to properly debug the issue.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Expected vs. Actual Behavior**\n\nClearly define what you expected to happen and what actually happened instead. This gap is the essence of your bug.\n\nFor instance: \"I expected the robot to stop when it detected an object 10cm away, but it continues moving until it bumps into the object.\"\n\n### **Step 3: Locate the Source of the Error**\n\nNarrow down where in your code the problem might be occurring. For larger programs, you can use techniques like:\n- Print statements to show values at different points in your code\n- Commenting out sections to see if the error disappears\n- Working backwards from where the incorrect behavior appears\n\nIn robotics programming, it's helpful to check:\n- Sensor readings (are they giving accurate values?)\n- Motor commands (are they receiving the correct instructions?)\n- Decision logic (are your if/then statements evaluating correctly?)\n\n### **Step 4: Fix the Error and Test**\n\nMake a single, focused change that you believe will fix the issue. Then test your program again to see if the error is resolved. If you make multiple changes at once, you won't know which one actually fixed the problem.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Activity 1: Bug Detective**\n\n**Activity 1: Find the Bugs**\n\nReview the following simple robot movement program that contains three different types of errors. Identify what type each error is (syntax, logic, or runtime) and how you would fix it:\n\n\nfunction moveRobot() {\n  forward(10);\n  turn(90)\n  forward(5;\n  if (sensorValue > 50) {\n    backwards(10);\n  }\n  turn(45);\n  while (true) {\n    forward(1);\n  }\n}\n\n\nTry to find all three errors before checking the solution in your course materials!\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Testing with Different Scenarios**\n\nThorough testing is crucial for creating reliable programs. It's important to test your code with various inputs and situations.\n\n### **Input Testing**\n\nAlways test your program with:\n- Normal expected values\n- Boundary values (minimum and maximum allowed)\n- Invalid inputs (what happens if a user enters text when a number is expected?)\n\nFor a robot that follows a line, you might test:\n- Normal conditions: robot on a clear, dark line against a light background\n- Boundary conditions: robot on a faded line or a line with varying thickness\n- Invalid conditions: robot on a surface with multiple lines or no line at all\n\n### **Edge Cases**\n\nEdge cases are unusual but possible scenarios that might cause problems:\n- What if a sensor returns zero?\n- What if your robot reaches a physical barrier?\n- What if the battery is low?\n\nFor example, if you're programming a robot to navigate a maze, edge cases might include:\n- Dead ends that require the robot to turn around completely\n- Very narrow passages that might cause sensor confusion\n- Highly reflective surfaces that interfere with distance sensors\n\n### **Incremental Testing**\n\nInstead of writing a large program and then testing it all at once:\n1. Write a small piece of functionality\n2. Test it thoroughly\n3. Only when it works correctly, add the next feature\n4. Repeat\n\nThis approach makes it much easier to identify where errors occur.\n\nFor example, when programming a robot to pick up objects:\n1. First, test just the movement toward the object\n2. Then, test the gripper mechanism separately\n3. Next, test the combination of movement and gripping\n4. Finally, test the complete sequence including returning the object to a designated location\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you encountered a problem that required systematic troubleshooting (with technology, a game, or anything else). How did breaking down the problem help you solve it more effectively than random attempts?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Improving Your Programs**\n\nDebugging isn't just about fixing errorsâ€”it's also an opportunity to improve your code.\n\n### **Refactoring for Clarity**\n\nAfter fixing bugs, look for ways to make your code clearer and more maintainable:\n- Use meaningful variable and function names\n- Break long functions into smaller, focused ones\n- Add comments explaining complex sections\n\nFor example, instead of using a variable name like \"s1\" for a sensor, use \"distanceSensor\" to make your code easier to understand.\n\n### **Performance Optimization**\n\nOnce your program works correctly, you might want to make it run more efficiently:\n- Remove unnecessary steps\n- Look for repeated code that could be turned into a function\n- Consider whether there are more efficient algorithms\n\nIn robotics, efficient code can save battery power and make your robot respond more quickly to its environment.\n\n### **Documentation**\n\nGood documentation helps you and others understand your code later:\n- Explain what your program does\n- Document any assumptions or limitations\n- Note any special cases or considerations\n\nFor example, document that your line-following robot works best on high-contrast surfaces or that your obstacle-avoidance program expects objects to be at least 5cm tall to be detected reliably.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Creating a Robotics Test Plan**\n\nWhen testing robot programs, it helps to create a simple test plan. Here's an example for a line-following robot:\n\n1. **Basic Functionality Test**\n   - Does the robot follow a straight line?\n   - Does it follow a curved line?\n   \n2. **Sensor Test**\n   - Do all sensors detect the line correctly?\n   - What happens when sensors are partially on/off the line?\n   \n3. **Environmental Test**\n   - Does the program work in different lighting conditions?\n   - Does it work on different surfaces?\n   \n4. **Edge Case Test**\n   - What happens at intersections?\n   - What happens if the line ends?\n   - What happens if the robot loses the line?\n\nHaving a structured test plan helps ensure your robot will work reliably in real-world conditions, not just in ideal situations.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider your debugging process. Do you tend to make random changes hoping the problem will go away, or do you approach debugging systematically? How might adopting a more methodical approach improve your programming experience?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhat is the first step in debugging a program that isn't working?\n\nA. Start over with a new program\n\nB. Ask someone else to fix it\n\nC. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen\n\nD. Add more code to fix the problem\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is C. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen. Effective debugging starts with clearly understanding the problem by identifying the difference between the current behavior and the expected behavior. If you chose a different answer, remember that debugging is about methodical problem-solving rather than blind fixes or starting over. Understanding the problem is always the first step to solving it.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nDebug challenge game: Players are presented with a series of increasingly complex robot programs containing different types of errors. They must identify the specific error type (syntax, logic, or runtime) and select the correct fix from multiple options. For example, a simple robot navigation program might have a missing semicolon (syntax error), an incorrect turning angle (logic error), or a division by zero when calculating speed (runtime error). Players earn points based on speed and accuracy of their debugging."
