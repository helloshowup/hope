Unlike humans who can interpret vague directions, computers and robots need extremely clear, step-by-step instructions to function properly.\n\nThink of programming as writing a very detailed recipe. If you tell a person to \"bake cookies,\" they can fill in many details on their own. But a robot would need explicit instructions about ingredients, measurements, mixing procedures, oven temperature, and cooking time.\n\n### The Language of Machines\nProgramming languages are specially designed systems of communication that allow humans to \"speak\" to machines. These languages range from complex text-based languages (like Python or Java) to visual block-based systems that are easier for beginners to understand.\n\nJust as humans use words to build sentences and express ideas, programmers use programming elements to build instructions that computers and robots can follow.\n\n## Programming in the Input-Processing-Output Framework\nOne of the clearest ways to understand programming is through the Input-Processing-Output (IPO) framework:\n\n### Input\nInputs are the information that flows into the system. For robots, inputs often come from:\n- Sensors (light, touch, sound, distance)\n- User commands (buttons, voice, app controls)\n- Stored data (maps, images, pre-programmed rules)\n\n### Processing\nProcessing is where programming truly shines - it's the \"thinking\" part of the system that determines what to do with the inputs:\n- Decision making (if-then statements)\n- Calculations and comparisons\n- Following algorithms (step-by-step procedures)\n- Triggering actions based on conditions\n\n### Output\nOutputs are the visible results of the processing:\n- Physical movements (motors, wheels, arms)\n- Sounds or lights\n- Screen displays\n- Data recording\n\n### Real-World Example: Smart Home Thermostat\nLet's look at how the IPO framework works in a smart home thermostat:\n- **Inputs**: Temperature sensors detect it's 75°F in the room; the user has set the desired temperature to 70°F\n- **Processing**: The program compares current temperature to desired temperature and decides cooling is needed\n- **Outputs**: The thermostat turns on the air conditioning system\n\nThis same framework applies to assistive robots that help people. For example, a medicine reminder robot:\n- **Inputs**: Internal clock shows it's medication time; sensors detect a person is nearby\n- **Processing**: The program determines which medication is needed and that the person should be alerted\n- **Outputs**: The robot moves toward the person, plays a gentle sound, and displays which medication to take\n\n## Activity 1: Creating Everyday Algorithms\n\nIn this activity, pick a simple daily task like making a sandwich or brushing your teeth. Write down every single step needed to complete this task as if you were instructing someone who has never done it before. Be as precise and detailed as possible, leaving nothing to interpretation.\n\nFor example, instead of \"spread peanut butter,\" you might write:\n1. Open the peanut butter jar by twisting the lid counterclockwise\n2. Take a knife from the drawer\n3. Insert knife into the jar\n4. Lift out approximately 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on the knife\n5. Place the knife on the bread\n6. Move the knife in a back-and-forth motion to spread peanut butter evenly across the entire surface\n\nAfter completing your instructions, try to identify any steps that might still be unclear or open to interpretation.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you gave someone directions and they misunderstood what you meant. How does this experience relate to the precision needed in programming instructions for robots?\n\n## Key Programming Concepts\nTo become effective at programming robots, you'll need to understand several fundamental concepts:\n\n### Variables\nVariables are containers that store information your program needs to remember. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can place values:\n- A variable might store a robot's current speed (5 cm/second)\n- Another variable might track a sensor reading (25 cm distance)\n- Variables can change during program execution (hence the name \"variable\")\n\n### Algorithms\nAlgorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or accomplishing tasks. They're like detailed recipes that specify exactly what needs to happen and in what order:\n- They break complex problems into manageable steps\n- They can be reused for similar problems\n- Well-designed algorithms are efficient and reliable\n\n### Control Structures\nControl structures determine the flow of program execution:\n- Sequential execution (do A, then B, then C)\n- Conditional execution (IF temperature > 30 THEN turn on fan)\n- Loops (REPEAT moving forward UNTIL obstacle detected)\n- Functions (reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks)\n\n### Logical Operators\nLogical operators help make decisions:\n- AND: Both conditions must be true\n- OR: At least one condition must be true\n- NOT: Inverts a condition (true becomes false)\n\n## Introduction to Block-Based Programming\nBlock-based programming provides a visual approach to coding that's perfect for beginners:\n\n### What Are Programming Blocks?\nProgramming blocks are visual elements that represent programming commands. Instead of typing code, you drag and connect these blocks like puzzle pieces to create programs.\n\n### Benefits for Beginners\n- Eliminates syntax errors (no typos or missing punctuation)\n- Visually represents program structure\n- Provides immediate visual feedback\n- Focuses on logic rather than language rules\n\n### Common Block Types\n- Event blocks: Start programs when something happens (button press, program start)\n- Motion blocks: Control movement (forward, backward, turn)\n- Control blocks: Manage program flow (if-then, loops, wait)\n- Sensor blocks: Read information from the environment\n- Operator blocks: Perform calculations and comparisons\n\n### Examples in Robotics\nBlock-based programming is widely used in educational robotics:\n- LEGO MINDSTORMS\n- Scratch-based robot programming\n- VEX Robotics platforms\n- Many Arduino-based educational robots\n\n## From Requirements to Code: How Assistive Robots Are Programmed\n\nWhen creating robots that help people, programmers start with human needs and translate them into specific programming elements:\n\n1. **Identify the need**: \"A person with limited mobility needs help picking up objects from the floor\"\n\n2. **Define requirements**: \n   - The robot must detect objects on the floor\n   - It must be able to grasp different sized objects\n   - It must safely deliver objects to the person\n   - It must respond to voice commands\n\n3. **Translate to programming elements**:\n   - **Variables**: objectDetected, objectSize, robotPosition, batteryLevel\n   - **Algorithms**: objectDetection, pathPlanning, graspingSequence\n   - **Control structures**: IF objectDetected THEN initiate pickup sequence\n   - **Sensor integration**: Camera input to identify objects, touch sensors for safe grasping\n\nThis translation process is how programmers turn real human needs into working robot behaviors.\n\n## Case Study: Programming a Medicine Reminder Robot\n\nLet's look at how programming enables a robot to help someone remember to take their medication:\n\n**The Challenge**: Many people forget to take medications on time, which can affect their health.\n\n**The Solution**: A small robot that:\n- Keeps track of medication schedules\n- Alerts the person when it's time for medication\n- Can answer simple questions about the medication\n\n**Programming Elements**:\n- **Inputs**: Internal clock, voice recognition, medication database\n- **Processing**: Comparing current time to scheduled times, identifying voice commands\n- **Outputs**: Lights, sounds, spoken reminders, display screen information\n\n**Sample Program Logic**:\n```\nWHEN current time equals medication time\n    Turn on reminder light\n    Play gentle alert sound\n    IF person approaches robot\n        Say \"Time to take your [medication name]\"\n        Display medication information\n    IF 5 minutes pass with no response\n        Increase alert volume\n        Send notification to caregiver's phone\n```\n\nThis example shows how programming connects inputs (time, presence detection) to helpful outputs (reminders, information) through logical processing steps.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot that needs to navigate a maze. What kinds of inputs would it need? How would the program process those inputs? What outputs would result from the processing?\n\n## Check your understanding\nWhich of the following best describes programming in the context of robotics?\nA. Writing code in any language\nB. Creating art with computers\nC. Giving precise instructions that connect inputs to outputs\nD. Making websites\n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Giving precise instructions that connect inputs to outputs. Programming in robotics is about creating instructions that tell the robot how to process inputs and create appropriate outputs. If you chose A, while programming does involve writing code, the purpose in robotics specifically is to connect inputs to outputs. If you chose B or D, these are other applications of programming but don't specifically address the robotics context.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Programming is giving precise instructions to computers or robots, requiring clarity and specificity that humans may not need in everyday communication\n- In robotics, programming connects inputs (from sensors and users) to outputs (actions and responses) through logical processing steps\n- Block-based programming provides a visual, beginner-friendly way to create instructions for robots without dealing with complex syntax\n\n## Instructional designer notes of lesson\n**This lesson fits into the the overall module of Robots Helping People in the following ways:**\n- It establishes the fundamental programming concepts students need before they can design robots that assist humans\n- It introduces the input-processing-output framework that will be essential for understanding how robots perceive and respond to human needs\n- It prepares students for the more advanced programming concepts that will be covered in subsequent lessons of this module\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nSequencer game: Students would be presented with a series of block-based programming commands (like \"Move Forward,\" \"Check Sensor,\" \"If-Then Statement,\" \"Turn Right\") that they must arrange in the correct order to accomplish a task such as \"Help a robot navigate around an obstacle to deliver medicine to a patient.\" This tests their understanding of programming logic and the input-processing-output framework while reinforcing the module's theme of robots helping people.",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance.\nAnother misconception is that all robots are autonomous. In reality, many robots require continuous human control and are not capable of making decisions on their own.\n\n## Types of Robot Control Systems\nThere are several methods for controlling robots, from direct manual control to fully autonomous operation.\n```\n\n**Transformed:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

Unlike humans who can interpret vague directions, computers and robots need extremely clear, step-by-step instructions to function properly.\n\nThink of programming as writing a very detailed recipe.

For robots, inputs often come from:\n- Sensors (light, touch, sound, distance)\n- User commands (buttons, voice, app controls)\n- Stored data (maps, images, pre-programmed rules)\n\n### Processing\n**Processing** is where programming truly shines - it's the \"thinking\" part of the system that determines what to do with the inputs:\n- Decision making (if-then statements)\n- Calculations and comparisons\n- Following algorithms (step-by-step procedures)\n- Triggering actions based on conditions\n\n### Output\n**Outputs** are the visible results of the processing:\n- Physical movements (motors, wheels, arms)\n- Sounds or lights\n- Screen displays\n- Data recording\n\n### Real-World Example: Smart Home Thermostat\nLet's look at how the IPO framework works in a smart home thermostat:\n- **Inputs**: Temperature sensors detect it's 75°F in the room; the user has set the desired temperature to 70°F\n- **Processing**: The program compares current temperature to desired temperature and decides cooling is needed\n- **Outputs**: The thermostat turns on the air conditioning system\n\nThis same framework applies to assistive robots that help people. For example, a medicine reminder robot:\n- **Inputs**: Internal clock shows it's medication time; sensors detect a person is nearby\n- **Processing**: The program determines which medication is needed and that the person should be alerted\n- **Outputs**: The robot moves toward the person, plays a gentle sound, and displays which medication to take\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Activity 1: Creating Everyday Algorithms\n\nIn this activity, pick a simple daily task like making a sandwich or brushing your teeth. Write down every single step needed to complete this task as if you were instructing someone who has never done it before. Be as precise and detailed as possible, leaving nothing to interpretation.\n\nFor example, instead of \"spread peanut butter,\" you might write:\n1. Open the peanut butter jar by twisting the lid counterclockwise\n2. Take a knife from the drawer\n3. Insert knife into the jar\n4. Lift out approximately 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on the knife\n5. Place the knife on the bread\n6. Move the knife in a back-and-forth motion to spread peanut butter evenly across the entire surface\n\nAfter completing your instructions, try to identify any steps that might still be unclear or open to interpretation.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you gave someone directions and they misunderstood what you meant. How does this experience relate to the precision needed in programming instructions for robots?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n## Key Programming Concepts\nTo become effective at programming robots, you'll need to understand several fundamental concepts:\n\n### Variables\n**Variables** are containers that store information your program needs to remember. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can place values:\n- A variable might store a robot's current speed (5 cm/second)\n- Another variable might track a sensor reading (25 cm distance)\n- Variables can change during program execution (hence the name \"variable\")\n\n### Algorithms\n**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or accomplishing tasks. They're like detailed recipes that specify exactly what needs to happen and in what order:\n- They break complex problems into manageable steps\n- They can be reused for similar problems\n- Well-designed algorithms are efficient and reliable\n\n### Control Structures\n**Control structures** determine the flow of program execution:\n- Sequential execution (do A, then B, then C)\n- Conditional execution (IF temperature > 30 THEN turn on fan)\n- Loops (REPEAT moving forward UNTIL obstacle detected)\n- Functions (reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks)\n\n### Logical Operators\n**Logical operators** help make decisions:\n- AND: Both conditions must be true\n- OR: At least one condition must be true\n- NOT: Inverts a condition (true becomes false)\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Introduction to Block-Based Programming\n**Block-based programming** provides a visual approach to coding that's perfect for beginners:\n\n### What Are Programming Blocks?\nProgramming blocks are visual elements that represent programming commands. Instead of typing code, you drag and connect these blocks like puzzle pieces to create programs.\n\n### Benefits for Beginners\n- Eliminates syntax errors (no typos or missing punctuation)\n- Visually represents program structure\n- Provides immediate visual feedback\n- Focuses on logic rather than language rules\n\n### Common Block Types\n- Event blocks: Start programs when something happens (button press, program start)\n- Motion blocks: Control movement (forward, backward, turn)\n- Control blocks: Manage program flow (if-then, loops, wait)\n- Sensor blocks: Read information from the environment\n- Operator blocks: Perform calculations and comparisons\n\n### Examples in Robotics\nBlock-based programming is widely used in educational robotics:\n- LEGO MINDSTORMS\n- Scratch-based robot programming\n- VEX Robotics platforms\n- Many Arduino-based educational robots\n\n## From Requirements to Code: How Assistive Robots Are Programmed\n\nWhen creating robots that help people, programmers start with human needs and translate them into specific programming elements:\n\n1. **Identify the need**: \"A person with limited mobility needs help picking up objects from the floor\"\n\n2. **Define requirements**: \n   - The robot must detect objects on the floor\n   - It must be able to grasp different sized objects\n   - It must safely deliver objects to the person\n   - It must respond to voice commands\n\n3. **Translate to programming elements**:\n   - **Variables**: objectDetected, objectSize, robotPosition, batteryLevel\n   - **Algorithms**: objectDetection, pathPlanning, graspingSequence\n   - **Control structures**: IF objectDetected THEN initiate pickup sequence\n   - **Sensor integration**: Camera input to identify objects, touch sensors for safe grasping\n\nThis translation process is how programmers turn real human needs into working robot behaviors.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Case Study: Programming a Medicine Reminder Robot\n\nLet's look at how programming enables a robot to help someone remember to take their medication:\n\n**The Challenge**: Many people forget to take medications on time, which can affect their health.\n\n**The Solution**: A small robot that:\n- Keeps track of medication schedules\n- Alerts the person when it's time for medication\n- Can answer simple questions about the medication\n\n**Programming Elements**:\n- **Inputs**: Internal clock, voice recognition, medication database\n- **Processing**: Comparing current time to scheduled times, identifying voice commands\n- **Outputs**: Lights, sounds, spoken reminders, display screen information\n\n**Sample Program Logic**:\n```\nWHEN current time equals medication time\n    Turn on reminder light\n    Play gentle alert sound\n    IF person approaches robot\n        Say \"Time to take your [medication name]\"\n        Display medication information\n    IF 5 minutes pass with no response\n        Increase alert volume\n        Send notification to caregiver's phone\n```\n\nThis example shows how programming connects inputs (time, presence detection) to helpful outputs (reminders, information) through logical processing steps.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot that needs to navigate a maze. What kinds of inputs would it need? How would the program process those inputs? What outputs would result from the processing?\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich of the following best describes programming in the context of robotics?\n\nA. Writing code in any language\n\nB. Creating art with computers\n\nC. Giving precise instructions that connect inputs to outputs\n\nD. Making websites\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is C. Giving precise instructions that connect inputs to outputs. Programming in robotics is about creating instructions that tell the robot how to process inputs and create appropriate outputs. If you chose A, while programming does involve writing code, the purpose in robotics specifically is to connect inputs to outputs. If you chose B or D, these are other applications of programming but don't specifically address the robotics context.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- **Programming** is giving precise instructions to computers or robots, requiring clarity and specificity that humans may not need in everyday communication\n- In robotics, programming connects inputs (from sensors and users) to outputs (actions and responses) through logical processing steps\n- **Block-based programming** provides a visual, beginner-friendly way to create instructions for robots without dealing with complex syntax\n\n## Instructional designer notes of lesson\n**This lesson fits into the the overall module of Robots Helping People in the following ways:**\n- It establishes the fundamental programming concepts students need before they can design robots that assist humans\n- It introduces the input-processing-output framework that will be essential for understanding how robots perceive and respond to human needs\n- It prepares students for the more advanced programming concepts that will be covered in subsequent lessons of this module\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nSequencer game: Students would be presented with a series of block-based programming commands (like \"Move Forward,\" \"Check Sensor,\" \"If-Then Statement,\" \"Turn Right\") that they must arrange in the correct order to accomplish a task such as \"Help a robot navigate around an obstacle to deliver medicine to a patient.\" This tests their understanding of programming logic and the input-processing-output framework while reinforcing the module's theme of robots helping people."
