Understanding these error types helps you identify and fix them quickly.\n\n### Syntax Errors\nSyntax errors occur when your code doesn't follow the rules of the programming language. These are usually caught by the compiler or interpreter before your program runs. Examples include:\n- Missing punctuation (like semicolons or parentheses)\n- Misspelled commands\n- Incorrect capitalization\n- Using incorrect formatting\n\nThink of syntax errors like spelling or grammar mistakes in writing. Just as your teacher might mark these errors in your essay, the computer marks these errors in your code. For example, if you wrote `forwrd()` instead of `forward()`, the computer would show a syntax error because it doesn't recognize the misspelled command.\n\n### Logic Errors\nLogic errors are mistakes in the program's design that cause it to behave incorrectly. These errors don't prevent the program from running but cause incorrect results. Examples include:\n- Using the wrong operator (+ instead of -)\n- Incorrect sequence of commands\n- Faulty conditional statements (if/else)\n- Infinite loops\n\nLogic errors can be tricky because your program runs without error messages, but it doesn't do what you want. Imagine you're giving directions to a friend: \"Turn left at the stop sign, then right at the traffic light.\" If you meant to say \"Turn right at the stop sign,\" your friend would follow your directions perfectly but end up in the wrong place. That's similar to a logic error in programming.\n\n### Runtime Errors\nRuntime errors occur while your program is running. These can cause your program to crash or produce unexpected results. Examples include:\n- Dividing by zero\n- Accessing variables or functions that don't exist\n- Running out of memory\n- Trying to perform impossible actions (like telling a robot to move through a wall)\n\nRuntime errors happen when your code tries to do something impossible. It's like if you tried to divide 10 by 0 on your calculator - the calculator would show an error because division by zero isn't possible. Similarly, if your robot program tries to move through a wall, you'll get a runtime error because the robot can't physically do that.\n\n## The Debugging Process\nDebugging is a systematic process for finding and fixing errors in your programs. Following a structured approach makes debugging more efficient and effective.\n\n### Step 1: Reproduce the Problem\nBefore you can fix a bug, you need to consistently reproduce it. Try to identify:\n- What specific inputs or conditions cause the error\n- Whether the error happens every time or only occasionally\n- The exact sequence of steps that lead to the error\n\nThe first step in solving any problem is understanding exactly when and how it happens. If your robot only turns the wrong way sometimes, try to figure out what's different about those times. Does it happen when the robot is moving fast? Does it happen when the battery is low? Being a good detective at this stage saves a lot of time later!\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Expected vs. Actual Behavior\nClearly define:\n- What your program should be doing\n- What it's actually doing instead\n- The specific point where behavior deviates from expectations\n\nIn this step, you need to be very clear about what's going wrong. Instead of saying \"My robot program isn't working,\" be specific: \"My robot should turn right and then move forward 5 steps, but instead it turns right and moves forward continuously without stopping.\" The more precise you are about the difference between what should happen and what is happening, the easier it will be to find the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the Source of the Error\nUse these techniques to narrow down where the error occurs:\n- Add print statements to show variable values at different points\n- Comment out sections of code to isolate the problem\n- Use a debugger tool if available\n- Check your code against a working example\n\nNow it's time to find exactly where in your code the problem is happening. One helpful technique is adding \"print\" statements that show what's happening at different points in your program. For example, if your robot is supposed to stop after 5 steps but keeps going, you could add code to print out the step count. You might discover that the counter isn't increasing properly, or that the condition to stop is written incorrectly.\n\n### Step 4: Fix the Error and Test\nOnce you've found the error:\n- Make a single change to fix the problem\n- Test to make sure the fix works\n- Check that your fix didn't create new problems\n\nWhen fixing errors, it's best to make one change at a time and then test your program. This way, you'll know exactly which change fixed the problem. Sometimes fixing one problem can create new ones, so always test your program thoroughly after making changes. It's like fixing a bicycle - if you adjust the brakes, you should test them before riding down a big hill!\n\n## **Activity 1: Debug Detective**\nExamine the following robot program that should move forward, turn right, and then move forward again to reach a destination. However, it's not working correctly. Identify at least three errors in the code and explain how you would fix each one.\n\n\nfunction moveRobot() {\n  forward(steps: 5);\n  turnleft();\n  forward(10 steps);\n  if (atDestination = true) {\n    celebrate();\n  }\n}\n\n\nTry to identify syntax errors, logic errors, and any other issues that would prevent this program from working correctly.\n\n## Testing with Different Scenarios\nThorough testing involves checking how your program behaves under different conditions.\n\n### Test Case Design\nGood test cases should:\n- Cover both typical and edge cases\n- Include valid and invalid inputs\n- Test boundary conditions (like minimum and maximum values)\n- Check all possible paths through your code\n\nWhen designing tests for your robot program, think about all the different situations your robot might encounter. For example, if your robot is programmed to follow a line, you should test it on straight lines, curved lines, and intersections. You should also test what happens if there's no line at all, or if the line has a gap in it. By testing these different scenarios, you can make sure your program works in all situations, not just the easy ones.\n\n### Creating a Test Plan\nA systematic test plan includes:\n1. A list of specific scenarios to test\n2. The expected outcome for each scenario\n3. A way to verify the actual results\n4. Documentation of any discrepancies\n\nA test plan is like a checklist for your program. For a robot maze-solving program, your test plan might include tests like: \"Robot reaches the end of a straight path,\" \"Robot correctly turns at a T-junction,\" and \"Robot doesn't crash into walls.\" For each test, write down what should happen and then check if your program actually does it. Keep track of any tests that fail so you know what to fix.\n\n### Automated vs. Manual Testing\n- **Manual testing**: You personally run the program and observe its behavior\n- **Automated testing**: Write additional code that automatically tests your program\n- Both approaches are valuable - manual testing helps you understand the user experience, while automated testing can quickly check many different scenarios\n\nThere are two main ways to test your programs. Manual testing is when you run your program yourself and watch what happens. This is like playing a video game to see if it's fun. Automated testing is when you write another program to test your main program. This is like having a robot play the video game for you, trying every possible move to make sure nothing breaks. Both types of testing are important - manual testing helps you see how your program feels to use, while automated testing can check many more situations much faster.\n\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you encountered a problem in a program or game. How did you approach solving it? Consider how a systematic debugging process might have made finding the solution easier.\n\n## Improving Your Programs\nDebugging isn't just about fixing errorsâ€”it's also an opportunity to improve your code.\n\n### Code Refactoring\nAfter fixing bugs, consider:\n- Simplifying complex sections\n- Breaking long functions into smaller ones\n- Improving variable names for clarity\n- Adding comments to explain tricky parts\n\nRefactoring is like cleaning and organizing your room. Even if everything works, it can still be messy and hard to find things. When you refactor code, you make it cleaner and easier to understand without changing what it does. For example, if you have a long section of code that makes your robot dance, you might break it into smaller parts like \"spinMove()\", \"jumpMove()\", and \"waveMove()\". This makes your code easier to read and easier to fix if something goes wrong later.\n\n### Defensive Programming\nPrevent future bugs by:\n- Adding error checking for unusual situations\n- Validating input values before using them\n- Creating clear error messages\n- Using consistent formatting and styles\n\nDefensive programming is like wearing a helmet when you ride a bike - it helps protect you from problems before they happen. For example, if your program asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10, you should check that they actually entered a number in that range. If they enter 0 or 11 or \"banana,\" your program should display a helpful message instead of crashing. By planning for things that might go wrong, you make your programs more reliable and user-friendly.\n\n### Check your understanding\nWhat is the first step in debugging a program that isn't working?\nA. Start over with a new program\nB. Ask someone else to fix it\nC. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen\nD. Add more code to fix the problem\n\nChoose your answer and check it below.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen. Effective debugging starts with clearly understanding the problem by identifying the difference between the current behavior and the expected behavior. If you chose A, starting over is rarely the most efficient approach. If you chose B, while collaboration is valuable, you should first try to understand the problem yourself. If you chose D, adding more code without understanding the issue often makes the problem worse.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Debugging is a normal part of programming that all developers experience, not a sign of failure\n- Systematic testing helps identify programming errors more quickly and efficiently than random attempts\n- Small, incremental tests make debugging easier by isolating problems to specific sections of code\n[End of Lesson]\n\n## Instructional designer notes of lesson 6.5\n**This lesson fits into the the overall module of Smarter Robot Instructions (Advanced Programming) in the following ways:**\n- It provides essential troubleshooting skills that students will need throughout their programming journey\n- It builds on the programming concepts learned in previous lessons by teaching how to identify and fix problems\n- It prepares students for the more complex programming challenges in future modules\n- It develops critical thinking skills as students learn to systematically analyze and solve problems\n\n**This lesson could be followed by this game:**\nDebug challenge - Students compete to identify and fix errors in provided programs. For example, provide 3-5 robot programs with various types of errors (syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors). Students work individually or in teams to identify all the errors and fix them in the shortest time. Programs could include errors like incorrect loop conditions, missing or extra brackets, incorrect function calls, or logical sequence errors in robot movement instructions.",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Expert Prompt\n\nYou are a markdown formatting expert who makes precise, surgical edits to educational content. Your task is to make five specific types of formatting changes without altering any other content:\n\n## Transformation Types\n\n### 1. Bold Formatting for Key Terms\n\nAdd bold formatting to key terms, particularly headers and important concept labels.\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n**Transformed to:**\n```markdown\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Paragraph Break Preservation\n\nEnsure proper paragraph breaks by maintaining **exactly one empty line** between paragraphs. This is critical for HTML rendering.\n\n**Example Without Proper Breaks (WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. The first industrial robot, Unimate, changed this forever when it began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. This single robotic arm could work 24 hours a day without breaks, didn't get injured, and performed its tasks with perfect consistency.\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.\nThis robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs.\n```\n\n**Transformed with Proper Breaks (REQUIRED FOR HTML CONVERSION):**\n```markdown\n## Industrial Revolution in Robotics\n\nThe introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s.

A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 3. Page Break Strategy\n\n**Strategic Page Break Guidelines:**\n1. Divide content into logical lesson segments\n2. Ensure each segment is a complete, self-contained learning unit\n3. Maximum of 3 page breaks (4 total segments)\n4. Avoid splitting:\n   - Sections mid-concept\n   - Explanations across page breaks\n   - Related content that should remain together\n\n### 4. Format \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections\n\nIdentify and format all \"Stop and reflect\" sections by adding special marker tags.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? \nThink about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n### 5. Check Your Understanding Section Formatting\n\nTransform \"Check your understanding\" sections by adding specific opening and closing markers.\n\n**Original Format:**\n```markdown\n### **Check your understanding**\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\nA. Attention mechanisms\nB. Meaning mapping\nC. Conversational memory\nD. Token generation\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n```\n\n**Transformed Format:**\n```markdown\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhich NLP concept describes how AI understands relationships between words?\n\nA. Attention mechanisms\n\nB. Meaning mapping\n\nC. Conversational memory\n\nD. Token generation\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is B. Meaning mapping. Meaning mapping is how AI builds \nconnections between related ideas.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n```\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## Pattern Recognition Instructions\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Look for section headers, titles, or key concept labels\n2. Add bold formatting to these elements using markdown's double asterisks `**text**`\n3. Pay special attention to numbered items like \"Misconception #1:\" or similar patterns\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify logical paragraph breaks where new ideas or topics begin\n2. Ensure there is an empty line (double line break) between paragraphs\n3. Pay special attention to paragraphs that continue after section headers\n\n### Page Break Placement Considerations:\n1. Analyze document structure for natural lesson boundaries\n2. Consider breaking at:\n   - Major conceptual transitions\n   - Between foundational and advanced content\n   - Where a new learning objective begins\n3. Ensure each segment:\n   - Has a clear learning focus\n   - Contains complete explanations\n   - Does not leave readers hanging mid-concept\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Look for headings that explicitly say \"Stop and reflect\" (which may be H2, H3, etc.)\n2. These sections typically include a \"CHECKPOINT:\" prompt or similar reflection question\n3. They ask students to pause and think about a concept\n4. Also identify variations like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Look for sections that begin with \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading\n2. These sections typically contain multiple-choice questions (usually with A, B, C, D options)\n3. They include an answer explanation, often beginning with \"The correct answer is\"\n\n## Transformation Process\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n1. Identify key terms that require bold formatting\n2. Add `**` before and after the term to apply bold formatting\n3. Ensure no other text is inadvertently included in the bold formatting\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n1. Identify where logical paragraph breaks should occur\n2. **ALWAYS add an empty line between paragraphs** (this is critical for the HTML converter to recognize paragraphs)\n3. Ensure each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line (not multiple empty lines)\n4. Be careful not to create paragraph breaks within lists or code blocks\n5. Pay special attention to the first paragraph after headings - there should be an empty line after the heading\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n1. Evaluate the document for logical page break points\n2. Add `---pagebreak---` on its own line at these transition points\n3. Add page breaks sparingly and only where it makes sense\n4. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n1. Add `---stopandreflect---` immediately before the heading of the reflection section\n2. Add `---stopandreflectEND---` immediately after the last line of the reflection section\n3. Ensure markers are on their own lines with no text before or after\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n1. Replace the \"### **Check your understanding**\" heading with \"---checkyourunderstanding---\"\n2. Add a blank line after the question\n3. Ensure each answer option is separated by a blank line\n4. Identify where the question ends and the answer begins (usually starts with \"The correct answer is\")\n5. Insert \"---answer---\" at the beginning of the answer section\n6. Add \"---answerEND---\" at the end of the answer section\n7. Add \"---checkyourunderstandingEND---\" at the end of the entire section\n\n## Edge Case Handling\n\n### For Bold Formatting:\n- Only bold the specific term or header, not surrounding text\n- If a term is already bold, do not modify it\n- When in doubt about whether to bold a term, prioritize consistency with other similar terms in the document\n\n### For Paragraph Breaks:\n- Do not add paragraph breaks in the middle of a single thought or concept\n- Do not break up lists by adding paragraph breaks between list items\n- Do not add paragraph breaks inside code blocks or special formatting sections\n- Maintain any intentional paragraph structure in the original document\n- When in doubt about whether text represents one or multiple paragraphs, preserve the original structure\n\n### For Page Break Markers:\n- Do not add page breaks in the middle of a topic or section\n- Do not add page breaks inside lists, tables, or special formatting sections\n- When in doubt, err on the side of fewer page breaks\n- Ensure page breaks don't disrupt the reading flow or split important related content\n\n### For \"Stop and Reflect\" Sections:\n- If there are variations of \"Stop and reflect\" (like \"Let's reflect\" or \"Pause and think\"), format these the same way\n- Do not apply these markers to similar but different concepts like discussion questions\n- If a \"Stop and reflect\" section contains multiple reflection points, keep them within a single set of markers\n- Ensure both opening and closing markers are always present\n\n### For Check Your Understanding Sections:\n- Ensure proper spacing in multiple-choice questions:\n  - Add a blank line after the question text\n  - Add a blank line between each answer option (A, B, C, D)\n  - This spacing is critical for proper HTML rendering\n\n- For multiple questions within one \"Check your understanding\" section:\n  - Maintain a single set of outer markers (---checkyourunderstanding--- and ---checkyourunderstandingEND---)\n  - Add separate answer markers for each question's answer (---answer--- and ---answerEND---)\n  - Ensure each question and its options follow the proper spacing format\n\n- For sections that partially match the pattern:\n  - Only transform sections that fully match the \"Check your understanding\" format\n  - If uncertain, leave the section in its original format\n\n- When the answer is not clearly delineated:\n  - Look for phrases like \"The correct answer is\", \"The answer is\", or a paragraph following the options\n  - If the distinction is unclear, place \"---answer---\" before the first non-option text following the last option\n\n## Critical Preservation Guidelines\n\n1. **DO NOT change any content** except for adding the specified markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n2. **DO NOT alter existing formatting** such as italics, lists, or other markdown elements\n3. **DO NOT remove or add any text** other than the specified markers and paragraph breaks\n4. **DO NOT change headings** or modify the document structure in any way\n5. **DO NOT add extra spaces or lines** between the markers and the content\n6. **DO ensure that each paragraph is separated by exactly one empty line** - not multiple empty lines\n7. **DO NOT apply multiple transformations to the same text** conflictingly - if text is already part of a special section, do not additionally bold it unless it's a key term within that section\n8. **DO preserve the logical flow and organization** of the content while ensuring proper formatting\n9. **DO ensure all markers are on their own lines** with no text before or after them\n10. **DO apply all five transformations harmoniously** so they don't conflict with each other\n\n## Verification Process\n\nAfter completing all transformations:\n1. Compare the total word count of the original and transformed documents (excluding markers) - they should match\n2. Verify all special sections have been properly transformed with correct opening and closing markers\n3. Verify all key terms have been properly bolded\n4. Confirm that proper paragraph breaks (empty lines) exist between paragraphs\n5. Verify that page breaks are added at logical points and not excessively\n6. Confirm that no content has been altered other than adding the markers, bold formatting, and paragraph breaks\n7. Validate that the overall document structure remains intact with improved readability\n8. Check that all special sections have both opening and closing markers\n9. Ensure that no markers conflict with each other or create formatting issues\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Example 1: Combined Transformations with Paragraph Breaks and Page Break\n\n**Original:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\nMisconception #1: \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance.\nAnother misconception is that all robots are autonomous. In reality, many robots require continuous human control and are not capable of making decisions on their own.\n\n## Types of Robot Control Systems\nThere are several methods for controlling robots, from direct manual control to fully autonomous operation.\n```\n\n**Transformed:**\n```markdown\n## Common Robotics Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception #1:** \"All robots look like humans.\"\nReality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all.

Understanding these error types helps you identify and fix them quickly.\n\n### **Syntax Errors**\n\n**Syntax errors** occur when your code doesn't follow the rules of the programming language. These are usually caught by the compiler or interpreter before your program runs. Examples include:\n- Missing punctuation (like semicolons or parentheses)\n- Misspelled commands\n- Incorrect capitalization\n- Using incorrect formatting\n\nThink of syntax errors like spelling or grammar mistakes in writing. Just as your teacher might mark these errors in your essay, the computer marks these errors in your code. For example, if you wrote `forwrd()` instead of `forward()`, the computer would show a syntax error because it doesn't recognize the misspelled command.\n\n### **Logic Errors**\n\n**Logic errors** are mistakes in the program's design that cause it to behave incorrectly. These errors don't prevent the program from running but cause incorrect results. Examples include:\n- Using the wrong operator (+ instead of -)\n- Incorrect sequence of commands\n- Faulty conditional statements (if/else)\n- Infinite loops\n\nLogic errors can be tricky because your program runs without error messages, but it doesn't do what you want. Imagine you're giving directions to a friend: \"Turn left at the stop sign, then right at the traffic light.\" If you meant to say \"Turn right at the stop sign,\" your friend would follow your directions perfectly but end up in the wrong place. That's similar to a logic error in programming.\n\n### **Runtime Errors**\n\n**Runtime errors** occur while your program is running. These can cause your program to crash or produce unexpected results. Examples include:\n- Dividing by zero\n- Accessing variables or functions that don't exist\n- Running out of memory\n- Trying to perform impossible actions (like telling a robot to move through a wall)\n\nRuntime errors happen when your code tries to do something impossible. It's like if you tried to divide 10 by 0 on your calculator - the calculator would show an error because division by zero isn't possible. Similarly, if your robot program tries to move through a wall, you'll get a runtime error because the robot can't physically do that.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **The Debugging Process**\n\n**Debugging** is a systematic process for finding and fixing errors in your programs. Following a structured approach makes debugging more efficient and effective.\n\n### **Step 1: Reproduce the Problem**\n\nBefore you can fix a bug, you need to consistently reproduce it. Try to identify:\n- What specific inputs or conditions cause the error\n- Whether the error happens every time or only occasionally\n- The exact sequence of steps that lead to the error\n\nThe first step in solving any problem is understanding exactly when and how it happens. If your robot only turns the wrong way sometimes, try to figure out what's different about those times. Does it happen when the robot is moving fast? Does it happen when the battery is low? Being a good detective at this stage saves a lot of time later!\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Expected vs. Actual Behavior**\n\nClearly define:\n- What your program should be doing\n- What it's actually doing instead\n- The specific point where behavior deviates from expectations\n\nIn this step, you need to be very clear about what's going wrong. Instead of saying \"My robot program isn't working,\" be specific: \"My robot should turn right and then move forward 5 steps, but instead it turns right and moves forward continuously without stopping.\" The more precise you are about the difference between what should happen and what is happening, the easier it will be to find the problem.\n\n### **Step 3: Locate the Source of the Error**\n\nUse these techniques to narrow down where the error occurs:\n- Add print statements to show variable values at different points\n- Comment out sections of code to isolate the problem\n- Use a debugger tool if available\n- Check your code against a working example\n\nNow it's time to find exactly where in your code the problem is happening. One helpful technique is adding \"print\" statements that show what's happening at different points in your program. For example, if your robot is supposed to stop after 5 steps but keeps going, you could add code to print out the step count. You might discover that the counter isn't increasing properly, or that the condition to stop is written incorrectly.\n\n### **Step 4: Fix the Error and Test**\n\nOnce you've found the error:\n- Make a single change to fix the problem\n- Test to make sure the fix works\n- Check that your fix didn't create new problems\n\nWhen fixing errors, it's best to make one change at a time and then test your program. This way, you'll know exactly which change fixed the problem. Sometimes fixing one problem can create new ones, so always test your program thoroughly after making changes. It's like fixing a bicycle - if you adjust the brakes, you should test them before riding down a big hill!\n\n## **Activity 1: Debug Detective**\n\nExamine the following robot program that should move forward, turn right, and then move forward again to reach a destination. However, it's not working correctly. Identify at least three errors in the code and explain how you would fix each one.\n\n\nfunction moveRobot() {\n  forward(steps: 5);\n  turnleft();\n  forward(10 steps);\n  if (atDestination = true) {\n    celebrate();\n  }\n}\n\n\nTry to identify syntax errors, logic errors, and any other issues that would prevent this program from working correctly.\n\n---pagebreak---\n\n## **Testing with Different Scenarios**\n\nThorough testing involves checking how your program behaves under different conditions.\n\n### **Test Case Design**\n\nGood test cases should:\n- Cover both typical and edge cases\n- Include valid and invalid inputs\n- Test boundary conditions (like minimum and maximum values)\n- Check all possible paths through your code\n\nWhen designing tests for your robot program, think about all the different situations your robot might encounter. For example, if your robot is programmed to follow a line, you should test it on straight lines, curved lines, and intersections. You should also test what happens if there's no line at all, or if the line has a gap in it. By testing these different scenarios, you can make sure your program works in all situations, not just the easy ones.\n\n### **Creating a Test Plan**\n\nA systematic test plan includes:\n1. A list of specific scenarios to test\n2. The expected outcome for each scenario\n3. A way to verify the actual results\n4. Documentation of any discrepancies\n\nA test plan is like a checklist for your program. For a robot maze-solving program, your test plan might include tests like: \"Robot reaches the end of a straight path,\" \"Robot correctly turns at a T-junction,\" and \"Robot doesn't crash into walls.\" For each test, write down what should happen and then check if your program actually does it. Keep track of any tests that fail so you know what to fix.\n\n### **Automated vs. Manual Testing**\n\n- **Manual testing**: You personally run the program and observe its behavior\n- **Automated testing**: Write additional code that automatically tests your program\n- Both approaches are valuable - manual testing helps you understand the user experience, while automated testing can quickly check many different scenarios\n\nThere are two main ways to test your programs. Manual testing is when you run your program yourself and watch what happens. This is like playing a video game to see if it's fun. Automated testing is when you write another program to test your main program. This is like having a robot play the video game for you, trying every possible move to make sure nothing breaks. Both types of testing are important - manual testing helps you see how your program feels to use, while automated testing can check many more situations much faster.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n## Stop and reflect\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you encountered a problem in a program or game. How did you approach solving it? Consider how a systematic debugging process might have made finding the solution easier.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n## **Improving Your Programs**\n\nDebugging isn't just about fixing errorsâ€”it's also an opportunity to improve your code.\n\n### **Code Refactoring**\n\nAfter fixing bugs, consider:\n- Simplifying complex sections\n- Breaking long functions into smaller ones\n- Improving variable names for clarity\n- Adding comments to explain tricky parts\n\nRefactoring is like cleaning and organizing your room. Even if everything works, it can still be messy and hard to find things. When you refactor code, you make it cleaner and easier to understand without changing what it does. For example, if you have a long section of code that makes your robot dance, you might break it into smaller parts like \"spinMove()\", \"jumpMove()\", and \"waveMove()\". This makes your code easier to read and easier to fix if something goes wrong later.\n\n### **Defensive Programming**\n\nPrevent future bugs by:\n- Adding error checking for unusual situations\n- Validating input values before using them\n- Creating clear error messages\n- Using consistent formatting and styles\n\nDefensive programming is like wearing a helmet when you ride a bike - it helps protect you from problems before they happen. For example, if your program asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10, you should check that they actually entered a number in that range. If they enter 0 or 11 or \"banana,\" your program should display a helpful message instead of crashing. By planning for things that might go wrong, you make your programs more reliable and user-friendly.\n\n---checkyourunderstanding---\nWhat is the first step in debugging a program that isn't working?\n\nA. Start over with a new program\n\nB. Ask someone else to fix it\n\nC. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen\n\nD. Add more code to fix the problem\n---answer---\nThe correct answer is C. Identify exactly what's happening versus what should happen. Effective debugging starts with clearly understanding the problem by identifying the difference between the current behavior and the expected behavior. If you chose A, starting over is rarely the most efficient approach. If you chose B, while collaboration is valuable, you should first try to understand the problem yourself. If you chose D, adding more code without understanding the issue often makes the problem worse.\n---answerEND---\n---checkyourunderstandingEND---\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\n- Debugging is a normal part of programming that all developers experience, not a sign of failure\n- Systematic testing helps identify programming errors more quickly and efficiently than random attempts\n- Small, incremental tests make debugging easier by isolating problems to specific sections of code"
