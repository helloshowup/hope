At the movement’s\nforefront was William Morris, a young student of privileged background\nwho had become interested in poetry and architecture—and their seeming\ndisconnection with the industrialized world. Morris was inspired by John\nRuskin, a writer who insisted art could be the basis of a social order\nthat improved lives by unifying it with labor, as it had in the Middle\nAges. Together with Edward Burne-Jones, a fellow poet and painter, and\nPhilip Webb, an architect, Morris undertook the revitalization of\nEngland’s daily aesthetic life. Webb’s design of Red House in 1860 for a\njust-married Morris organized the spaces asymmetrically, based on their\nintended uses, thereby dictating <span id=\"ch01.xhtml_page_13\"\nclass=\"pagebreak\"></span>the shape of the facade.

The company that resulted from this experience, Morris and\nCompany, vigorously advocated the notion that fitness of purpose\ninspired form; their prolific output in textiles, objects, glass, and\nfurnishings heralded a way of working that responded to content, was\nsocially concerned, and paid utmost attention to the finished quality of\nthe work, even when it was mass-produced.", "ality of\nthe work, even when it was mass-produced.\n\n\\_\\_\\_ Arthur Mackmurdo and Sir Emery Walker, two of Morris’\ncontemporaries, directed his attention toward type and book design.\nMackmurdo’s periodical, *The Hobby Horse*, espoused the same qualities—a\npurposeful proportioning of space and careful control of type size, type\nselection, margins, and print quality—to which Morris had aspired, but\nin printed form. In 1891, Morris established the Kelmscott Press in\nHammersmith, producing exquisitely designed books in which the\ntypefaces, woodblock illustrations, and materials were designed for\ntheir aesthetic integration and ease of production. Morris’s most\nambitious project was *The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer*, produced in 1894.\nIts illustrations, display type blocks, and carved initials were\nintegrated through size relationships, and its layouts conformed to an\noverall predetermined structure that dramatically unified the pages and\nallowed for faster production.

Moholy and his students—in particular,\nHerbert Bayer—used bars, rules, squares, and type asymmetrically\ncomposed on a grid as the basis of a new typography. Lissitsky returned\nfrom Russia numerous times, establishing contact with the Bauhaus and\nparticipating in lectures, book designs, and exhibitions.

Within a year he had\nassimilated the school’s typographic approach and abstract sensibility.\nIn 1925, he designed a twenty-four-page insert for the *Typographische\nMitteilungen*, a German printers’ magazine, which demonstrated these\nideas to a large audience of typesetters, designers, and printers.\n*Elementare Typographie*, as it was titled, generated a tremendous\nenthusiasm for asymmetric and grid-based layout. Tschichold advocated a\nreductive and intrinsically functional aesthetic. He asserted that\nstripping away ornament, giving priority to sans serif type that made\nthe structure of letterforms explicit, and creating compositions based\non the verbal function of words were goals that would liberate the\nmodern age. Negative spaces, the intervals between areas of text, and\nthe orientation of words to each other formed the basis for design\nconsideration. Taking his cues from Lissitsky and the Bauhaus, he\ndeliberately built his compositions on a system of vertical and\nhorizontal alignments, introducing hierarchical grid structure in\ndocuments from posters to letterheads. As early as 1927, the year before\nhe published his landmark book *Die Neue Typographie* (The New\nTypography), Tschichold codified this idea of structure and advocated\nits use to standardize printing formats.

A grid’s *orthogonal*\n(90° axis) logic, and all the thinking about how to work with it, derive\nfrom the fundamental verbivisual qualities of type. Choosing or\ndeveloping a grid for a project depends on understanding these\nqualities, knowing what kinds of grids there are, and the possibilities\nfor how type (and images) might interact within the structure.\n\n<img src=\"images/f0020-01.jpg\" class=\"vh60\" alt=\"Image\" />", "=\"images/f0020-01.jpg\" class=\"vh60\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\nAlthough grids may seem overtly mathematical, the notion of this\nstructural approach grows quite organically from the nature of\ntypographic form.  \n———  \nAt its most fundamental level, type is a system of vertical lines (these\nbeing the primary element of all the letters in the Western alphabet).\nSequenced side by side to form words, and then sentences, the verticals\nform a horizontal line. Stacking horizontal sentences below each other\ncreates a new vertical line—the column—and columns appearing side by\nside establish yet another horizontal structure.\n\n<span id=\"ch01.xhtml_page_21\"\nclass=\"pagebreak\"></span>![Image](images/f0021-01.jpg)", "s=\"pagebreak\"></span>![Image](images/f0021-01.jpg)\n\nWithin the format, alignments between elements create structure. In\nthese compositions, space is divided based on content: like information\nis grouped together, disparate information is separated; their resulting\nwidths and heights subdivide the surrounding field. Changes in weight\nand scale introduce hierarchy—visual ordering—to the information.\nGroupings may give rise to a single axis that divides the space into two\nsimple fields, as in the example at top; or they may establish numerous\naxes and, hence, more complex subdivisons. Within strict limitations, an\nenormous variety of possible layouts can be imagined. These, for\nexample, both use the same type family and only a selection of possible\nsizes.", "ype family and only a selection of possible\nsizes.\n\n![Image](images/f0021-02.jpg)", "of possible\nsizes.\n\n![Image](images/f0021-02.jpg)\n\nTypographic space is governed by the part-to-whole relationships that\nalignments define but, more importantly, by the relation of positive and\nnegative they create. Thinking structurally about layouts means being\nable to see not only the forms, or positive elements, but negative\nspaces—“white space,” as it’s often called—as shapes of equal importance\nin the composition. A grid organizes space as much as it does the stuff\nthat’s in it. In this book spread, the negative spaces actively enhance\nthe up-and-down vertical rhythm of columns as a counterpoint to the\nstrong horizontal axis that links various column parts together across\nthe spread; being mostly horizontal in proportion, they echo that\nquality of the image.  \n<span class=\"f3\">Timothy Samara / USA</span>", "ge.  \n<span class=\"f3\">Timothy Samara / USA</span>\n\n### <span id=\"ch01.xhtml_page_22\" class=\"pagebreak\"></span>The Anatomy of Pages\n\n#### Format Structures", "/span>The Anatomy of Pages\n\n#### Format Structures\n\nAll page-layout conventions descend from the book format that developed\nbetween the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 CE and the European\nRenaissance of the 15th century.

The margin measures among\nformats may stay the same, or they may change around the grouping of\nmodules; columns or rows of modules can be removed or added to,\ndepending on the proportion of a given format; the entire group of\nmodules can be scaled down as a unit to create a more detailed grid for\ncomplex uses, like a book, or scaled up as a unit to create a simplified\nversion for bolder expression.", "create a simplified\nversion for bolder expression.\n\n<img src=\"images/f0052-01.jpg\" class=\"vh60\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\nThe grid for this poster is based on the proportional aspect ratio of a\nfilm still: The module is the size and shape of one frame.

One of these is\nstrictly visual: Each new screen or page spread engages the reader in a\nnew way. Another result might be that the reader is cued to a\nsignificant content change, thereby clarifying informational function.\nTo some degree, the pacing of material relates directly to its ordering,\nor distribution. The ordering process accounts for location and actual\nsequence of raw content, whereas pacing is concerned with the formal\nvariation that has been imposed upon it—ordering is about function;\npacing is about feeling.", "dering is about function;\npacing is about feeling.\n\n\\_\\_\\_ Indeed, such organization may be an intrinsic part of the concept\nthat governs the visual presentation of the content. The designer may\nget some sense of a project’s potential pacing while ordering its\ncontent, but it ultimately depends on the message he or she is trying to\nconvey with the system’s rules. Throughout a sequence of page spreads in\na publication, for example, application of the system’s rules for the\nsizes, weights, and styles of various text elements will automatically\ncreate a recognizable rhythm that will likely support the informational\nhierarchy. However, this intrinsic pacing may seem too even, or quietly\npaced, in the context of his or her concept; or, the designer may decide\nthat this quietness is appropriate, but notices that some content\nelements could benefit from a pacing change that employs another of the\nsystem’s formal rules to help emphasize or feature them.

But every field\nof artistic endeavor comprises different schools of thought, some of\nthem contradictory, and graphic design is no exception. Just as the use\nof grids in modern design practice grew from developments in technology,\naesthetic thought, and industrialization, the use of alternate,\nintuitive methods of composition—prevalent in current design\npractice—grew from these same influences.", "t design\npractice—grew from these same influences.\n\n\\_\\_\\_ Along with the marvels of mechanized production came a\nproficiency at cruelty and destruction. The late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries were plagued by war on a scale that was previously\nunknown, facilitated by such innovations as the Gatling gun, tanks,\ngrenades, and mines. This madness, coupled with Sigmund Freud’s\npublications about the human psyche, fueled an exploration of the absurd\nand primal in art and design. As early as the 1880s, a tendency toward\nprimal image making as a reaction to the devastation of machines and war\nbegan to find a voice: Art Nouveau’s sensual plant imagery signaled a\npursuit of the individual, organic, and idiosyncratic in design;\nExpressionism’s aggressive works showed a growing preoccupation with\nsuffering in the human condition; Dada and Surrealism explored the\nsubconscious, dream states, and the absurdities of language and culture.", "ates, and the absurdities of language and culture.\n\n### A NEW VISUAL REALITY", "of language and culture.\n\n### A NEW VISUAL REALITY\n\nThese latter movements began as reactions to World War I. Co-opting the\nstrange, new language of visual abstraction, the Dadaists applied it to\nverbal language to express their horror over the war. In 1914, the poet\nHugo Ball opened the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich as a meeting place for\npoets, writers, musicians, and artists who shared this outrage. They\nincluded Tristan Tzara, who prepared their manifestos and edited the\nmagazine *DADA;* Jean Arp, a painter and sculptor; and, later, Marcel\nDuchamp, a painter who began his career as a Cubist but was more\nfascinated by symbolism and linguistic games. Language and experience\nbecame bound in Dada’s explosive word poems and nonsense posters where\nwords failed to correspond to any explicit meaning. In Dada, letters and\n<span id=\"ch02.xhtml_page_127\" class=\"pagebreak\"></span>words are\npictures of emotional or psychological states, and their power comes\nfrom aggressive visual arrangements signifying those states, not as\ncarriers of literal meaning. Dada’s use of type as image was similar to\nthat of other movements, like Futurism, in which the visual treatment of\ninformation was also used as a pictorial vehicle for the viewer’s\nassociations. Filippo Marinetti, Futurism’s founder, used repeated\nletterform patterns and dynamic scale and placement to convey ideas\nabout sound, motion, and the violent power of machines.", "sound, motion, and the violent power of machines.\n\n\\_\\_\\_ Cubist and Symbolist poets in France also explored the syntactic\nportrayal of writing through typography based on its spoken or verbal\nattributes. Stéphane Mallarmé and Guillaume Appolinaire created word\npictures in poems and essays in which page structure was defined by the\nimage. Appolinaire’s now-famous concrete poem “Il Pleut” (“It’s\nRaining”) is organized in vertical lines that resemble a picture of\nrain. Appolinaire and poets like him were influenced by semiotics, the\nstudy of signs, from the writings of Charles Pierce, an American, and\nFerdinand de Saussure of France.", "an American, and\nFerdinand de Saussure of France.\n\n\\_\\_\\_ This poeticizing of visual expression—characterized by visual\nword play and the signification of subject matter or actual experience\nby unrelated signs—was rapidly becoming a trend in visual communication\nthat would run counter to the steady development of rationalism.\n\n<img src=\"images/f0126-01.jpg\" class=\"vh80\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\n***Le Hasard* \\[Chance\\] / Poetry Study**  \nAfter Stephane Mallarmé  \n*Author’s schematic recreation, presented in English translation*\n\n### ORDER AND DISORDER UNITED", "nglish translation*\n\n### ORDER AND DISORDER UNITED\n\nCollage was another new visual analogy that built on the reenvisioning\nof form begun in Cubism, which juxtaposed found images in dynamic\nrelationships where chance could play a role in the perception of\nmeaning. The Berlin Dadaists Hanna Hoch and Raoul Hausemann were among\nthe first known artists to employ collage. The designer and artist Kurt\nSchwitters, who worked in Hanover, is particularly notable for helping\nto establish both grid-based and irrational systems in design.\nSchwitters’s work as a Dadaist was supported by his business as an\nadvertising designer with prestigious accounts. His output of collaged\ntypographic clippings and refuse alternated with professional posters\nand layouts for magazines, including his own, *Merz*, which featured\narticles and visual essays based on his nonsense poems. Schwitters\nfrequently collaborated with Theo van Doesburg and El Lissitsky,\nblending his Constructivist interests with those of Dada.

Itten’s\nexperiments in the type shop, before Moholy-Nagy replaced him in 1923,\nhad begun to incorporate painterly, nonrectilinear composition, and the\nuse of elements from the type case: he used lines of lead, usually\nreserved for spacing, as a decorative element to visually enhance the\nemphasis within type.

Designers in Zurich pursued a\nrational intellectualism that privileged typography and grid systems\n(see [**Coming to Order**](#ch01.xhtml_ch01lev1)). Basel designers, on\nthe contrary—working in the context of that city’s humanist\ntradition—explored richly meaningful form specific to each\ncommunication. They exploited the narrative power of signs and diverse\nimage languages to produce lyrical and evocative communications. The\nwork of Nelly Rudin, Igildo Biesele, and Armin Hoffmann embodied these\nprinciples—which Hoffmann promulgated as director of the Basel design\nschool. In 1942, he enlisted Emil Ruder as typography teacher. Both\nRuder’s work and teaching method focused on typography that derived from\na structural perspective, but he also focused on clearly integrating it\nwith imagery by stressing its pictorial potential. Unlike\nMüller-Brockmann, Ruder freely mixed weight, slant, and size changes,\neven within single lines of type, to achieve a semiotic representation\nof language. In his 1960 book, *Typography*, Ruder devotes several pages\nto a discussion of grids, but nowhere near as much space as he devotes\nto the exposition of type as an image with intrinsic semantic visual\nqualities.

Students from the\nBasel and Zurich schools—and also from the *Kunstgewerbeschule* in Ulm,\nGermany—were disseminating its reductive aesthetic. Corporations\nbenefited from the unifying and cost-efficient aspects of the grid-based\nidentity systems that these students advocated. But as the younger\ndesign community—along with everyone else—continued its recovery from\nthe second World War, it was becoming increasingly critical of\nestablished ways of thinking, increasingly wary of corporate and\ngovernmental motives, and increasingly interested in opposing the kind\nof classist impulses that had repressed and brutalized specific groups\nof people in the war. In the United States, the civil rights movement\ndrew attention to disenfranchised groups; revolutions in Cuba and China\nevinced similar kinds of unrest. In the midst of the International\nStyle’s methodical efficiency, a search for expression based on personal\nexperience and narrative was catalyzed by the visceral thump of rock n’\nroll, the sexual revolution, and the rise of popular youth culture.\nPyschedelia, television, and a rediscovery of Art Nouveau gave rise to\ndesign idioms and countermovements that don’t fit neatly into the bigger\ntrends: Victor Moscoso and Haight-Ashbury psychedelic rock posters on\nthe West Coast of America; Milton Glaser, Seymour Chwast, and the\nidiosyncratic, historical illustrative style of the PushPin Group; and\nthe “big idea” conceptual advertising of Bob Gill, Bill Bernbach, and\nHenry Wolf.

A similar\nlogic of counterpoint, that of structure against lack thereof, pervades\nthe wall layout at every level—some elements adhering to grids and\nothers freely ignoring them.\n\nDESIGN\n\n**Poulin+Morris**  \nNew York, NY | USA\n\n**Permanent exhibition for Vassar College Integrated Sciences Commons**\n\n![Image](images/f0232-01.jpg)\n\n<img src=\"images/f0232-02.jpg\" class=\"vh80\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\n<span id=\"ch02.xhtml_page_233\"\nclass=\"pagebreak\"></span>![Image](images/f0233-01.jpg)", "s=\"pagebreak\"></span>![Image](images/f0233-01.jpg)\n\n<span id=\"cont.xhtml\"></span>\n\n## <span id=\"cont.xhtml_page_234\" class=\"pagebreak\"></span><span class=\"g1\">Directory of Contributors</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nAtlas\n\n19, 57, 63, 118  \n<span class=\"c2\">Can Danus, 3  \n07001 Palma de Mallorca  \nBalearic Islands, Spain  \n[www.designbyatlas.com](http://www.designbyatlas.com)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nBatesHori \\[Allen Hori\\]\n\n132, 220  \n<span class=\"c2\">1200 Broadway, \\#2C  \nNew York, NY 10001 / USA  \n[www.bateshori.com](http://www.bateshori.com)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nJessica Berardi  \n163  \n<span class=\"c2\">Carnegie Mellon University  \nPittsburgh, PA 15213 / USA  \n[www.carnegiemellon.edu](http://www.carnegiemellon.edu)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_", "edu](http://www.carnegiemellon.edu)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nJennifer Bernstein  \n202–203  \n<span class=\"c2\">57 West 28th St. 3rd Floor  \nNew York, NY 10001  \n[www.levelnyc.com](http://www.levelnyc.com)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nDan Boyarski  \n152  \n<span class=\"c2\">Carnegie Mellon University  \nPittsburgh, PA 15213 / USA  \n[dan.boyarski@carnegiemellon.edu](mailto://dan.boyarski@carnegiemellon.edu)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nBruketa & Zini´c OM  \n218–219  \n<span class=\"c2\">Zavrtnica 17  \n10 000 Zagreb, Croatia  \n[www.bruketa-zinic.com](http://www.bruketa-zinic.com)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nBüro Uebele  \nVisuelle Kommunikation  \n84, 94, 170, 180, 206–207,  \n216–217, 226  \n<span class=\"c2\">Heusteigstrasse 94a  \n70180 Stuttgart, Germany  \n[www.uebele.com](http://www.uebele.com)</span>", "y  \n[www.uebele.com](http://www.uebele.com)</span>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nC.
