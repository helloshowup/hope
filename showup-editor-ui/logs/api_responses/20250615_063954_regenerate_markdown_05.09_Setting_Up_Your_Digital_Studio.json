  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a comprehensive collection of resources related to equipment calibration, preventative maintenance, environmental control, and workspace organization for graphic design professionals. It covers a wide range of topics, including monitor and printer calibration, computer and input device maintenance, temperature/humidity management, power protection, ergonomics, lighting, and digital asset management. The resources include a mix of informational guides, product recommendations, and interactive tools.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objective for this enhancement is to ensure all spelling follows British English conventions. This includes making precise changes to:\n- '-our' instead of '-or' (e.g., 'colour' instead of 'color')\n- '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (e.g., 'organise' instead of 'organize')\n- '-re' instead of '-er' (e.g., 'centre' instead of 'center')\n- '-ogue' instead of '-og' (e.g., 'dialogue' instead of 'dialog')\n- '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (e.g., 'anaesthesia' instead of 'anesthesia')\n- Double 'l' in verb inflections (e.g., 'travelled' instead of 'traveled')\n- '-ement' instead of '-ment' (e.g., 'judgement' instead of 'judgment')\n- '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (e.g., 'learnt' instead of 'learned')\n\nNo other changes to the content, structure, or formatting should be made.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds. They have a basic understanding of design principles and software tools from their first-year studies, but need to develop advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design, digital prototyping, project management, and client communication.\n\nThese learners are hands-on, self-directed, and visually oriented. They require digital alternatives to practical exercises and high-quality visual demonstrations. They are digitally connected and comfortable with online learning platforms, but also value opportunities for community building and troubleshooting technical issues.\n\nThe content should be adapted to match the learners' level of understanding, using clear and concise language, relevant examples, and an appropriate level of complexity. Any technical terms or industry jargon should be explained or contextualized.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of fully online accessible materials and optional virtual meetups. This means the content must be optimized for asynchronous online learning, with a focus on visual aids, annotated examples, and opportunities for practical application.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and practical value of the original content\n- Ensure the content is accessible and engaging for the target learner group\n- Preserve the original structure, formatting, and layout as much as possible\n- Avoid any unnecessary changes beyond the required British English spelling corrections\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content and identify all instances of American or non-British spellings that need to be corrected.\n2. Make the necessary spelling changes to align with British English conventions, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n3. Ensure all technical terms and industry-specific vocabulary are correctly spelled and maintained.\n4. Review the content for clarity, concision, and appropriate language level for the target learners.\n5. Incorporate visual aids, annotated examples, and opportunities for practical application to enhance the online learning experience.\n6. Consider adding brief explanations or contextual information for any technical concepts or industry jargon to aid comprehension.\n7. Preserve the original structure, formatting, and layout as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the content.\n\nThe goal is to enhance the content by correcting the spelling while preserving the original value and adapting it to the needs of the target learners and the asynchronous online learning medium.",
