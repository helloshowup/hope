Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HND Graphic Design Learner Profile\n\n## Core Demographics\n- Second-year graphic design students (18+)\n- Varied backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers)\n- Basic design foundations from year one studies\n- Accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Preparing for professional careers in graphic design\n- Exploring specialization opportunities within the field\n- Building a professional portfolio of work samples\n- Obtaining HND certification as a professional credential\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- **Has:** Basic Higher National Certifcatre understanding of design principles, software tools, creative processes\n- **Needs:** Advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, presentation techniques\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Hands-on learners requiring digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Self-directed with strong independent research and problem-solving abilities\n- Visual learners dependent on high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Digitally connected through alternative community platforms\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context\n- Building professional confidence and industry readiness\n- Keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies\n- Developing proper digital workflow and file management practices\n- Balancing independent study with structured coursework\n- Troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Fully online accessible learning materials and assessment\n- High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs\n- Annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries\n- Optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building\n- Regular opportunities for practical application of advanced concepts\n\nThis learner ultimately seeks to emerge with specialized competencies, professional confidence, and an industry-ready portfolio that demonstrates their technical proficiency and creative capabilities.\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 05.17 1B Color Verification, Checklist and Cheat Sheet\n\n- [ ] Color palette adheres to brand guidelines\n- [ ] Color contrast meets accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)\n- [ ] Colors are consistent throughout the design\n- [ ] Color modes are appropriate for output (CMYK for print, RGB for digital)\n- [ ] Spot colors are properly defined for specialty printing\n- [ ] Color blindness considerations have been tested\n- [ ] Background/foreground combinations maintain readability\n- [ ] Color usage reinforces information hierarchy\n- [ ] Colors appear as intended across different devices/screens\n- [ ] Black text uses appropriate values (rich black for print, true black for digital)\n\n## Comprehensive Typography Verification Table\n\n| Category | Verification Point | Check (Yes/No/N/A) | Notes/Action Required |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Font Consistency** | All fonts used are approved and consistent with brand guidelines/design system | | |\n| | Multiple fonts (if used) are complementary and visually distinct | | |\n| | Formatting (font, background color, size, alignment) is consistent across similar text elements | | |\n| | Default system fonts are used appropriately for web compatibility | | |\n| | No missing or inactive font files are present | | |\n| **Visual Hierarchy** | Clear visual hierarchy established (headings, body, etc.) via size, weight, style | | |\n| | Headlines and subheads convey content hierarchy effectively | | |\n| | Body copy is easily readable; decorative/thin fonts avoided for long passages | | |\n| | Text blocks are concise, using short copy/bulleted lists for scannability | | |\n| | Interactive text (links, buttons) is descriptive and clearly visible | | |\n| | Center-aligned text is used sparingly (fewer than three lines) | | |\n| | ALL CAPS, italics, bold, underline are used selectively, not for entire paragraphs | | |\n| | Backgrounds do not obscure overlay text readability | | |\n| **Detailed Spacing** | Leading (line spacing) is adjusted for optimal readability (e.g., 1.5-2.0 for documents) | | |\n| | Tracking (letter-spacing) is consistently applied for legibility | | |\n| | Kerning (individual letter spacing) is adjusted for problematic pairs | | |\n| | Consistent line lengths are maintained within text blocks | | |\n| | Sufficient whitespace surrounds text blocks and elements | | |\n| **Accessibility** | Minimum body text size is 16px for web content | | |\n| | Minimum text size is 12pt (14pt/18pt preferred) for print | | |\n| | Text can be resized/zoomed to 200% without loss of content/functionality | | |\n| | Spacing (letters, words, lines, paragraphs) is adjustable without loss of content | | |\n\n## Color System Essentials\n\n### Brand Adherence and Palette Consistency\n\nColor builds brand recognition through:\n\n- Strict adherence to established brand guidelines and defined color palette\n- A simple palette of 2-3 primary colors with supporting shades\n- Consistent primary brand color across all touchpoints\n- Clear naming conventions for colors (e.g., \"Primary Blue\" rather than hex codes)\n- Testing colors in various contexts (buttons, text, backgrounds)\n\nColor serves as a critical accessibility and usability feature that extends beyond aesthetics. Failure to meet color standards can lead to user exclusion, poor user experience, and potential legal compliance issues.\n\n### Color Profile Accuracy\n\nEnsure accurate color reproduction by:\n\n- Verifying colors are correctly set to CMYK or Pantone for print, RGB for digital\n- Calibrating computer screens to accurately represent final output\n- Understanding how uncalibrated screens can distort color perception\n- Implementing a defined color system for design consistency and efficiency\n\nA systematic approach to color management prevents mismatched colors, accessibility issues, and wasted resources when moving between digital and print environments.\n\n### Contrast Ratios for Accessibility\n\nMeet WCAG accessibility guidelines by ensuring:\n\n- Paragraph text maintains a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (AA compliance)\n- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold+) maintains a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio (AA)\n- For AAA compliance: 7:1 ratio for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text\n- Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify ratios\n- Test print materials in black and white to reveal potential contrast issues\n\nThe interplay between digital and print color considerations requires different approaches to quality control, as a design that appears perfect on a digital screen may print inaccurately if not properly prepared.\n\n### Functional Use of Color\n\nColor must serve functional purposes beyond aesthetics:\n\n- Never use color as the sole means of conveying information\n- Add underlines or icons to links (not just color)\n- Include text or symbols with colored indicators (e.g., error messages)\n- Test various color pairings for readability\n- Apply consistent color variations for interactive states (hover, clicked)\n\nThis ensures that all users, including those with visual impairments or color blindness, can successfully navigate and understand your design.\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
