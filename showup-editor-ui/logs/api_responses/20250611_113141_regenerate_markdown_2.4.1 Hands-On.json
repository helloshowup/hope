This activity will help you compare **human body systems** to **robot components**, so you can see how robots mimic (or differ from) the way people work.\n\n### Instructions: Complete the Comparison Chart\n\n1. **Open the Chart**  \n     \n- Download or open the **“Human vs. Robot Systems Comparison Chart”** (linked above or in your course materials).\n\n   \n\n2. **Look at Each Human System**  \n     \n- You’ll see body systems like the **skeletal system**, **nervous system**, **digestive system**, and more.\n\n   \n\n3. **Match to Robot Systems**  \n     \n- For each one, think about:  \n       \n- **What does this body system do for humans?**  \n- **What kind of robot system does the same job?**  \n- **What parts or components help robots do that?**  \n- **Where do you see this in real-world robots?**\n\n   \n\n4. **Use What You’ve Learned**  \n     \n- Refer to your lesson notes about:  \n       \n- **Input systems** (sensors like cameras or bump sensors)  \n- **Processing systems** (microcontrollers and programs)  \n- **Output systems** (motors, grippers, screens)  \n- **Power systems** (batteries, solar panels)\n\n     \n\n- Use the robot examples from earlier (like the delivery robot, industrial arm, or toy robot) to help fill in the “real robot” column.\n\n   \n\n5. **Write Simply and Clearly**  \n     \n- Use short, clear phrases. Bullet points are okay\\!  \n- Use your own words—don’t just copy from the lesson.\n\n### Example:\n\n**Human System:** *Nervous System*   \n**Robot Function:** Processes information and makes decisions   \n**Robot Components:** Microcontroller, software, memory   \n**Real Robot Example:** Industrial robot arm calculating movement path\n\n### Reflection Time\n\nAfter filling out the chart, read the reflection questions at the bottom of the page:\n\n- Think about what’s hard for robots to copy from humans.  \n- Imagine what cool systems robots could have that humans don’t\\!  \n- Jot down your answers in full sentences.\n\n### You're Done When:\n\n- Every row in the chart has something written in each column.  \n- You've answered all 4 reflection questions thoughtfully.\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a meticulous Markdown Editor, specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing.\n\nObjective: To ensure the received Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\nContext: The input will be a raw Markdown text file. The aim is not to rewrite content, but rather to polish its presentation through formatting adjustments. You should avoid making any substantive changes to the actual text content.\n\nConstraints:\n\nDo not introduce new content or alter the meaning of the existing text. Your work is purely cosmetic formatting.\nMaintain existing Markdown syntax wherever possible. Avoid converting elements into HTML or other formats.\nPrioritize readability and common Markdown conventions. If ambiguities arise, err on the side of what is most commonly understood and used in Markdown.\nParameters:\n\nBulleted Lists: Ensure all bulleted lists use consistent syntax (either -, *, or + as the bullet point marker – if a style is already present, maintain it; otherwise, default to -). Ensure proper indentation for nested lists (using four spaces or a tab). Remove redundant or incorrectly placed bullet points. Verify that blank lines separate list items when appropriate for longer entries or to improve readability.\n\nHeadings: Confirm that headings are correctly formatted using the # symbol notation. Ensure there is a single space between the # symbols and the heading text. Verify correct heading levels are used according to the document's implied structure, correcting obvious errors (e.g. skipping heading levels). Confirm there is a blank line before and after each heading.\n\nParagraph Spacing: Ensure there is at least one blank line between paragraphs to create clear visual separation. Remove any excessive blank lines (more than two consecutive blank lines).\n\nSpaces: Ensure that only one space exists between words. Remove any double spaces.\n\nDetailed Guidance:\n\nAnalyze the entire document first to understand the general structure and formatting style currently used.\n\nAddress bulleted lists: Correct any inconsistencies in bullet point markers, indentation, and spacing.\n\nRefine headings: Ensure proper # syntax, spacing, heading levels, and spacing between heading and body.\n\nAdjust paragraph spacing: Add or remove blank lines to create consistent and visually appealing paragraph separation.\n\nDo not assume errors: Only make changes where there is a clear formatting issue according to standard Markdown conventions.\n\nPreserve special characters: Ensure special characters (e.g., *, _, >) that are intended for Markdown formatting are correctly used and escaped if needed. If these character are not intended for formatting, ensure that are properly escaped.\n\nPrioritize consistency: Maintain the existing style and conventions of the document unless there is a clear error.\n\nYour objective is to return a meticulously formatted Markdown document, ready for publishing or further use.\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a hands-on activity that guides learners to compare and contrast human body systems with the components and functions of robots. The activity is structured around a comparison chart, where learners are asked to match human systems to their robotic counterparts and provide examples of real-world robots that utilize those systems. The content also includes a reflection section where learners are prompted to think critically about the similarities and differences between humans and robots.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objectives for enhancing this content are:\n\n1. Ensure consistent and optimal formatting of bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing to improve readability.\n2. Maintain the educational integrity and learning objectives of the original content.\n3. Adapt the language, examples, and complexity level to better suit the target middle school audience.\n4. Incorporate more visual elements and engagement strategies to support the asynchronous online delivery format.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n\nThe content should use language and examples that are familiar and relatable to this middle school audience. Concepts should be explained in a clear, concise manner, with ample visual support and opportunities for active engagement.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through Excel Middle School's asynchronous online curriculum, with no peer interaction. This means the formatting and presentation must be optimized for self-paced, independent learning without the ability to clarify concepts in real-time.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the core learning objectives and educational value of the original content.\n- Enhance the visual appeal and engagement level to maintain the attention of middle school learners in an online setting.\n- Ensure the language, examples, and complexity level are appropriate for the 5th-6th grade reading level.\n- Maintain consistent formatting and structure to support independent learning.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Review the current content to fully understand the overall structure, key concepts, and learning objectives.\n2. Analyze the comparison chart and ensure the formatting of bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing is consistent and follows best practices for Markdown.\n3. Simplify the language used throughout the content to align with the 5th-6th grade reading level, while preserving the educational integrity.\n4. Incorporate more visual elements, such as labeled diagrams, images, and visual examples, to support the asynchronous online delivery.\n5. Add engagement strategies, like \"Stop and Think\" moments and real-world connections, to make the technical content more relatable and memorable for the middle school audience.\n6. Maintain the overall flow and structure of the activity, but consider breaking up longer sections into smaller, more manageable \"chunks\" of information.\n7. Review the final enhanced content to ensure it meets the target learner's needs and the specified formatting requirements.",
