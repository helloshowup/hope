Verify that:\n\n- All fonts adhere to established brand guidelines and design systems\n- Multiple fonts (if used) complement each other while remaining visually distinct\n- Formatting attributes (style, background colors, size, alignment) are consistent across similar text elements\n- Web designs utilize appropriate system fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Roboto) for broad compatibility\n- No missing or inactive font files exist that could cause rendering issues\n\n### Visual Hierarchy and Readability\n\nEffective typography establishes clear visual hierarchy by:\n\n- Distinguishing between headings, subheadings, and body text through size, weight, and style\n- Structuring headlines to convey content hierarchy\n- Ensuring body copy is easily readable (avoid decorative or thin fonts for long passages)\n- Using concise text blocks and bulleted lists to enhance scannability\n- Making interactive elements descriptive and visually distinct\n- Using center-aligned text sparingly (fewer than three lines)\n- Applying styles like ALL CAPS, italics, bold, and underline selectively\n- Ensuring background elements don't compromise text legibility\n\n### Detailed Spacing\n\nPrecise text spacing enhances legibility through:\n\n- Appropriate leading (line spacing) for optimal readability (1.5-2.0 for documents)\n- Consistent tracking (letter-spacing) within words\n- Manual kerning adjustments for problematic letter pairs in headlines and logos\n- Consistent line lengths within text blocks\n- Sufficient whitespace around text elements to prevent cluttered appearance\n\n### Accessibility Standards for Text\n\nEnsure text meets accessibility requirements:\n\n- Minimum body text size of 16px for web content\n- Minimum 12pt (preferably 14-18pt) for print materials\n- Text can be resized/zoomed up to 200% without loss of content or functionality\n- Spacing between letters, words, lines, and paragraphs is adjustable\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a comprehensive typography checklist and reference guide for graphic designers. It covers key considerations around font consistency, visual hierarchy, detailed spacing, and accessibility standards for text. The guide provides a basic typography checklist as well as a more detailed quality control checklist with specific verification points.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement task is to carefully review the existing content and correct any non-British English spellings to their proper British equivalents. This includes changes such as:\n- '-our' instead of '-or' (e.g., 'colour' instead of 'color')\n- '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (e.g., 'organise' instead of 'organize')\n- '-re' instead of '-er' (e.g., 'centre' instead of 'center')\n- '-ogue' instead of '-og' (e.g., 'dialogue' instead of 'dialog')\n- '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (e.g., 'anaesthesia' instead of 'anesthesia')\n- Double 'l' in verb inflections (e.g., 'travelled' instead of 'traveled')\n- '-ement' instead of '-ment' (e.g., 'judgement' instead of 'judgment')\n- '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (e.g., 'learnt' instead of 'learned')\n\nThe goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The original structure, content, and formatting must be preserved.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds and a mix of direct-from-secondary and career-changer students. They have a basic understanding of design principles and software tools from their first-year studies, but need to develop more advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, and presentation techniques.\n\nThese learners are hands-on, self-directed, and visually oriented. They require digital alternatives to practical exercises and rely on high-quality demonstrations and examples. They are digitally connected and access content through limited in-person and online platforms.\n\nThe key challenges for these learners include bridging theory and practice in a professional context, building professional confidence and industry readiness, keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies, developing proper digital workflow and file management practices, balancing independent study with structured coursework, and troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of fully online accessible learning materials and assessment, with optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building. High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs, annotated examples, and comprehensive image galleries will be provided to support the learners' visual learning preferences.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and value of the original content\n- Ensure the content is appropriate for the target learner's skill level and learning preferences\n- Optimize the content for the specified asynchronous online delivery medium\n- Preserve the original structure, formatting, and technical terminology while correcting non-British spellings\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the entire content, identifying all instances of non-British spellings that need to be corrected.\n2. Make the necessary spelling changes to align with British English conventions, following the specific guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n3. Ensure that all formatting, layout, and punctuation are preserved exactly as in the original content.\n4. Verify that all technical terms with standard spellings are left unchanged.\n5. Conduct a final review to confirm that the content maintains its original educational value and structure while adhering to British spelling norms.\n\nThe enhanced content should serve as a comprehensive, visually engaging, and accessible typography reference guide for the target HND Graphic Design learners, enabling them to develop their technical proficiency and professional confidence in the field.",
