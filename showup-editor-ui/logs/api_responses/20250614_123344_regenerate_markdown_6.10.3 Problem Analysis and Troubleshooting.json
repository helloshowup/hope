When your robot doesn't perform as expected, it's not a failure—it's an opportunity to learn! Troubleshooting is a normal and valuable part of the engineering process that helps you understand your robot more deeply. Let's look at how to approach problems systematically rather than through random guesswork or frustration.\n\nThis section covers methodical approaches to identifying and resolving issues discovered during robot testing.\n\n### Identifying Failure Points\n\nWhen your robot isn't working correctly, finding exactly where the problem lies is the first step to fixing it. Start by breaking down your robot into systems: mechanical (structure, moving parts), electrical (power, wiring), and programming (code, logic).\n\nTest each system separately when possible. For mechanical issues, check if parts move freely, if anything is loose, or if components are aligned properly. For electrical problems, verify connections are secure, batteries are charged, and no wires are damaged. For programming issues, try running simplified versions of your code to isolate which parts work and which don't.\n\nA helpful technique is the \"half-split\" method: if you're not sure which of ten components has a problem, test in the middle (component #5). If that works, the problem is in components #6-10. If it doesn't, the problem is in components #1-5. Keep dividing the suspicious area in half until you find the exact failure point.\n\nRemember to check the obvious things first! Many \"complex\" problems turn out to be simple issues like a loose wire, low battery, or a sensor that's been bumped out of position.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nFinding the root cause means looking beyond the obvious symptom to discover why the problem happened in the first place. For example, if your robot keeps veering to the left, the symptom is the turning, but the root cause could be:\n- Uneven wheel sizes\n- More friction on one side\n- Unbalanced weight distribution\n- A programming error in the steering calculations\n- A motor that's weaker on one side\n\nA useful technique is the \"Five Whys\" method. Start with the problem and keep asking \"why\" until you reach the fundamental cause. For example:\n1. Why is the robot veering left? Because the right wheel is turning faster.\n2. Why is the right wheel turning faster? Because the left wheel has more resistance.\n3. Why does the left wheel have more resistance? Because the wheel isn't aligned properly.\n4. Why isn't the wheel aligned? Because the mounting bracket is bent.\n5. Why is the bracket bent? Because the material is too thin for the robot's weight.\n\nNow you know you need a stronger bracket, not just a programming fix that compensates for the turning!\n\n### Systematic Debugging Approaches\n\nWhen solving robot problems, working methodically saves time and frustration. Think of yourself as a detective gathering clues rather than making random guesses about what might be wrong.\n\nFor mechanical debugging:\n- Isolate moving parts and test them individually\n- Look for interference between components\n- Check for loose or overtightened connections\n- Verify that parts are properly aligned\n\nFor electrical debugging:\n- Test power sources first (batteries, connections)\n- Use a multimeter if available to check voltages\n- Verify that all connections are secure\n- Look for shorts or damaged wires\n\nFor programming debugging:\n- Add \"debug prints\" to show values at different points in your code\n- Comment out sections to see if problems disappear\n- Test simple commands to verify basic functionality\n- Check sensor readings to ensure they're providing accurate data\n\nDocument everything you try and the results you observe. This prevents you from trying the same unsuccessful fix twice and helps you spot patterns that might reveal the underlying problem.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a test where your robot didn't perform as expected. What did this failure teach you about your design assumptions? Reflect on how this unexpected outcome revealed gaps in your understanding of the problem.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Troubleshooting is a systematic process that involves identifying failure points in mechanical, electrical, and programming systems, then testing each component methodically rather than making random guesses.\n- The \"Five Whys\" technique helps find the root cause of problems by repeatedly asking why a problem occurs until reaching the fundamental issue that needs fixing.\n- Documenting all troubleshooting attempts and results prevents repeating unsuccessful fixes and helps identify patterns that reveal underlying problems.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a meticulous Markdown Editor, specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing.\n\nObjective: To ensure the received Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\nContext: The input will be a raw Markdown text file. The aim is not to rewrite content, but rather to polish its presentation through formatting adjustments. You should avoid making any substantive changes to the actual text content.\n\nConstraints:\n\nDo not introduce new content or alter the meaning of the existing text. Your work is purely cosmetic formatting.\nMaintain existing Markdown syntax wherever possible. Avoid converting elements into HTML or other formats.\nPrioritize readability and common Markdown conventions. If ambiguities arise, err on the side of what is most commonly understood and used in Markdown.\nParameters:\n\nBulleted Lists: Ensure all bulleted lists use consistent syntax (either -, *, or + as the bullet point marker – if a style is already present, maintain it; otherwise, default to -). Ensure proper indentation for nested lists (using four spaces or a tab). Remove redundant or incorrectly placed bullet points. Verify that blank lines separate list items when appropriate for longer entries or to improve readability.\n\nHeadings: Confirm that headings are correctly formatted using the # symbol notation. Ensure there is a single space between the # symbols and the heading text. Verify correct heading levels are used according to the document's implied structure, correcting obvious errors (e.g. skipping heading levels). Confirm there is a blank line before and after each heading.\n\nParagraph Spacing: Ensure there is at least one blank line between paragraphs to create clear visual separation. Remove any excessive blank lines (more than two consecutive blank lines).\n\nSpaces: Ensure that only one space exists between words. Remove any double spaces.\n\nDetailed Guidance:\n\nAnalyze the entire document first to understand the general structure and formatting style currently used.\n\nAddress bulleted lists: Correct any inconsistencies in bullet point markers, indentation, and spacing.\n\nRefine headings: Ensure proper # syntax, spacing, heading levels, and spacing between heading and body.\n\nAdjust paragraph spacing: Add or remove blank lines to create consistent and visually appealing paragraph separation.\n\nDo not assume errors: Only make changes where there is a clear formatting issue according to standard Markdown conventions.\n\nPreserve special characters: Ensure special characters (e.g., *, _, >) that are intended for Markdown formatting are correctly used and escaped if needed. If these character are not intended for formatting, ensure that are properly escaped.\n\nPrioritize consistency: Maintain the existing style and conventions of the document unless there is a clear error.\n\nYour objective is to return a meticulously formatted Markdown document, ready for publishing or further use.\n",
