When peers review your work, they become additional mirrors, revealing perspectives you'd never see alone. This peer feedback loop—where you share reflections and receive honest insights from classmates—creates a powerful mechanism for deeper understanding and accelerated growth. In this activity, you'll work in triads to exchange reflections and identify evidence of development in each other's work.<!---edited-end-->\n\n## The Value of Peer Feedback\nPeer feedback transforms individual reflection into collaborative learning. When you review a classmate's reflection, you not only help them see blind spots in their thinking, but you also strengthen your own analytical skills. By identifying evidence of growth in others' work, you develop a keener eye for recognizing progress in your own learning journey.\n\n<br/>\nThe process of giving and receiving feedback builds critical communication skills that extend far beyond Excel High School. In professional settings, the ability to provide constructive, evidence-based feedback is highly prized, as is the capacity to receive feedback with openness and apply it effectively.\n\n## Activity Instructions\n\n**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes\n**Tools Needed:** Access to your triad group in the Excel Student Portal\n\n### How the Triad Exchange Works\nIn your assigned triad group, you'll exchange your written reflections with two peers. Each member will:\n\n<br/>\n1. **Read carefully** (10-15 minutes): Review both peers' reflections in depth, noting specific examples of growth, insight, or learning.\n\n<br/>\n2. **Tag evidence** (10 minutes): Identify and highlight at least three specific statements or passages that demonstrate growth. Use the comment feature in the Excel Student Portal to explain why these represent development.\n\n<br/>\n3. **Ask questions** (5-10 minutes): Pose at least two thoughtful questions that might help your peer extend their thinking or consider new perspectives.\n\n<br/>\n4. **Provide constructive feedback** (10 minutes): Offer specific suggestions for how the reflection could be strengthened, focusing on content rather than mechanics.\n\n<br/>\n5. **Acknowledge strengths** (5 minutes): Highlight what was particularly effective or insightful about the reflection.\n\n### Tips for Success\n\n- **Be specific**: Instead of \"good job,\" try \"Your analysis of how you approached the problem in new ways shows significant growth in your critical thinking.\"\n- **Focus on growth**: Look for evidence of learning, not just completion of tasks.\n- **Ask open-ended questions**: \"Have you considered how this approach might apply to...?\" rather than yes/no questions.\n- **When receiving feedback**: Listen with an open mind and resist the urge to defend or explain. The goal is to gain new insights from how others perceive your work.\n\n### Example Feedback\n\"In paragraph 2, you mentioned how you initially struggled with the concept but then created your own examples to understand it better. This shows growth in your self-directed learning strategies. Have you thought about applying this same approach to other challenging concepts?\"\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Peer feedback transforms individual reflection into collaborative learning by providing new perspectives, helping identify blind spots, and strengthening analytical skills for both the giver and receiver.\n- The structured triad exchange process develops critical communication skills through reading, tagging evidence, asking questions, providing constructive feedback, and acknowledging strengths.\n- Effective peer feedback focuses on specific examples of growth rather than general comments, uses open-ended questions to extend thinking, and requires openness to receiving new insights without defensiveness.\n\n---",
  "instructions": "You are a meticulous Markdown Editor, specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing.\n\nObjective: To ensure the received Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\nContext: The input will be a raw Markdown text file. The aim is not to rewrite content, but rather to polish its presentation through formatting adjustments. You should avoid making any substantive changes to the actual text content.\n\nConstraints:\n\nDo not introduce new content or alter the meaning of the existing text. Your work is purely cosmetic formatting.\nMaintain existing Markdown syntax wherever possible. Avoid converting elements into HTML or other formats.\nPrioritize readability and common Markdown conventions. If ambiguities arise, err on the side of what is most commonly understood and used in Markdown.\nParameters:\n\nBulleted Lists: Ensure all bulleted lists use consistent syntax (either -, *, or + as the bullet point marker – if a style is already present, maintain it; otherwise, default to -). Ensure proper indentation for nested lists (using four spaces or a tab). Remove redundant or incorrectly placed bullet points. Verify that blank lines separate list items when appropriate for longer entries or to improve readability.\n\nHeadings: Confirm that headings are correctly formatted using the # symbol notation. Ensure there is a single space between the # symbols and the heading text. Verify correct heading levels are used according to the document's implied structure, correcting obvious errors (e.g. skipping heading levels). Confirm there is a blank line before and after each heading.\n\nParagraph Spacing: Ensure there is at least one blank line between paragraphs to create clear visual separation. Remove any excessive blank lines (more than two consecutive blank lines).\n\nSpaces: Ensure that only one space exists between words. Remove any double spaces.\n\nDetailed Guidance:\n\nAnalyze the entire document first to understand the general structure and formatting style currently used.\n\nAddress bulleted lists: Correct any inconsistencies in bullet point markers, indentation, and spacing.\n\nRefine headings: Ensure proper # syntax, spacing, heading levels, and spacing between heading and body.\n\nAdjust paragraph spacing: Add or remove blank lines to create consistent and visually appealing paragraph separation.\n\nDo not assume errors: Only make changes where there is a clear formatting issue according to standard Markdown conventions.\n\nPreserve special characters: Ensure special characters (e.g., *, _, >) that are intended for Markdown formatting are correctly used and escaped if needed. If these character are not intended for formatting, ensure that are properly escaped.\n\nPrioritize consistency: Maintain the existing style and conventions of the document unless there is a clear error.\n\nYour objective is to return a meticulously formatted Markdown document, ready for publishing or further use.\n",
