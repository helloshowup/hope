  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content provides a structured approach for Excel High School learners to create a personalized weekly schedule and balanced academic plan. It covers setting SMART goals, incorporating Focusmate productivity sessions, and building a comprehensive weekly schedule that balances study time, breaks, and personal time. The content aims to help learners take control of their academic journey and transform good intentions into measurable progress.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block, generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the embedded request, while ensuring the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material.\n3. Match the document's existing tone, style, and technical level, and avoid using first person.\n4. Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including:\n- **Traditional Achievers (14-18)**: College-bound students who want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self-pacing.\n- **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)**: Learners who juggle work/family and require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance.\n- **Credit Recovery Students**: Learners in a short-term, high-pressure situation who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n- **Homeschooling Families**: Families seeking accredited curriculum where parents act as co-learners.\n- **Middle School Learners (11-14)**: Learners who need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n- **Specialized/International Students**: Learners who enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc. and demand tailored pathways.\n- **\"Second-Chance\" Learners**: A cross-segment group who crave an empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\nThe content should be adapted to address the diverse needs of these learner segments, using appropriate language, examples, and complexity levels.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for asynchronous online delivery through the Excel High School's LearnStage LMS/SIS platform. This platform features AI tools, competency-based education, parent/student portals, and multimedia courseware - all without physical textbooks.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content, which is to help learners create a personalized, balanced weekly plan.\n2. Address the specific enhancement requirements outlined in the prompt, such as identifying and enhancing all instruction blocks.\n3. Preserve the original content's value and flow, while adapting it to better suit the target learner profiles.\n4. Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium, leveraging the platform's features and capabilities.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content and identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded or lack clear formatting.\n2. For each instruction block, generate relevant, thoughtful content that fulfills the embedded request. Ensure the new content integrates seamlessly with the surrounding material.\n3. Adapt the tone, style, and technical level of the content to match the target learner profiles, using appropriate language, examples, and complexity.\n4. Leverage the platform's features, such as AI tools, competency-based education, and multimedia resources, to enhance the learning experience.\n5. Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout the content.\n6. Preserve the core purpose and value of the original content while addressing the enhancement requirements.\n\nThe goal is to create a cohesive, learner-centric document that reads as if the enhanced content was always part of the original, while optimizing the learning experience for the diverse target audience and the asynchronous online delivery medium.",

Focusmate provides a structured environment where you can work alongside a virtual accountability partner, creating external motivation to stay on task. By integrating these sessions into your weekly schedule, you establish dedicated time blocks for focused work on your most challenging assignments.\n\n1.

A well-structured plan prevents overwhelm by distributing workload evenly throughout the week while ensuring adequate time for rest and rejuvenation. This balanced approach sustains long-term productivity and helps prevent burnout.\n\nNow, combine your SMART goals and Focusmate sessions into a comprehensive weekly schedule:\n\n1. Start with fixed commitments (classes, family obligations, work shifts, etc.)\n2. Add your SMART goal work blocks, highlighting Focusmate sessions\n3. Ensure balance by including:\n   - Study time for each subject\n   - Breaks between intense work periods (try the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break)\n   - Personal time for rest and recreation\n   - Weekly review sessions to assess progress\n\n## Weekly Plan Template\n\nThe template below provides a framework to visualize your weekly schedule. This organizational tool helps distribute your workload effectively across different days and times. By mapping out your week in advance, you can identify potential scheduling conflicts, ensure adequate coverage for all subjects, and maintain a healthy balance between academic responsibilities and personal time.\n\n## Weekly Plan Template\n\n| Time | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Weekend |\n|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Morning | Math SMART goal | English reading | Science review | Math practice | Weekly review | Flexible study |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWith your personalized weekly plan now taking shape, it's important to implement and refine this system.
