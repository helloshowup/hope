  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",

Communities often have challenges that become so familiar they fade into the background of daily life. This exercise asks you to pause and notice what others might overlook, considering both obvious and subtle needs that affect community well-being.\n\n- What issues do you notice in your neighborhood, school, or wider community?\n- Who is affected by this challenge?\n- Why does this issue persist?\n- What resources might be lacking that contribute to this problem?\n\n**Task:** Write a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing the challenge and why you believe it's important to address.\n\n### Develop an Empathetic Response (20-25 minutes)\nNow that you've identified a challenge, consider how to address it in a way that respects and empowers those affected. Effective community service goes beyond quick fixes to consider the lived experiences of community members. The most sustainable solutions emerge when helpers listen deeply and collaborate with those they aim to serve.\n\n- Show understanding of the perspectives of those directly impacted\n- Consider the dignity and agency of community members\n- Build on existing community strengths\n- Address root causes when possible, not just symptoms\n- Be realistic about what resources would be needed\n\n**Task:** Write 1-2 paragraphs explaining your proposed response and how it demonstrates empathy.\n\n### Peer Exchange and Feedback (25-30 minutes)\nSharing perspectives enriches everyone's understanding of community challenges. By exchanging ideas with peers, you'll gain insights that might not have occurred to you working alone. This collaborative approach mirrors how effective community organizations operate—drawing on diverse viewpoints to develop more comprehensive solutions.\n\n- Highlight aspects of their response that demonstrate strong empathy\n- Ask at least one question that helps them consider an additional perspective\n- Offer one constructive suggestion to strengthen their proposed response\n- Share any relevant personal experiences or insights about the challenge they identified\n\n**Note:** If you're completing this course independently without peer interaction, you can submit your work directly to your instructor for feedback, or use the BRYTE AI Tutor to receive guidance on your response.\n\n### Reflection (10-15 minutes)\nThe learning process doesn't end with creating a response—reflection deepens understanding and improves future efforts. Taking time to consider feedback and different perspectives helps refine approaches to community challenges. This final step transforms the activity from a simple assignment into a meaningful learning experience with lasting impact.\n\n**Task:** Write a short reflection (5-7 sentences) addressing:\n- What new insights did you gain through this exchange?\n- How might you refine your approach based on the feedback?\n- What surprised you most about your peer's perspective?\n\n## Submission Guidelines\nSubmit your completed work including:\n1. Your identified local challenge\n2. Your empathetic response\n3. Your reflection after feedback\n\nRemember, the goal of this activity isn't to solve complex social problems in one step, but to practice identifying needs through an empathetic lens and to learn from diverse perspectives. These skills form the foundation of meaningful community service.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you have questions or need assistance with this activity, reach out to your Success Coach or use the Excel High School tutoring center."
