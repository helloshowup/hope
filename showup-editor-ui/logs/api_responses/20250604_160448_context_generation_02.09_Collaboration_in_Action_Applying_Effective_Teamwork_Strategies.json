Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are about to receive a markdown document that includes embedded instructions for content generation.

  "response": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a reflective piece on the role distribution process within a team collaboration. It covers the writer's specific responsibilities, how roles were determined, the strengths and potential challenges of the approach, plans for adaptation, and personal growth goals. The content appears to be part of a larger document or assignment.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt requests that you:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks marked by special delimiters (%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%END_REQUEST%%%).\n2. For each instruction block, carefully read and understand the content request, then generate appropriate content to fulfill it.\n3. Replace the entire instruction block (including the delimiters) with your generated content.\n4. Ensure the new content flows naturally with the surrounding text.\n5. Match the style, tone, and technical level of the existing document, but do not use first person.\n6. Pay attention to the context provided by the paragraphs before and after each instruction block, any formatting requirements mentioned, and the overall purpose and audience of the document.\n7. Maintain consistent terminology throughout the final output.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including traditional high school students, adult diploma seekers, credit recovery students, homeschooling families, middle school learners, specialized/international students, and \"second-chance\" learners. Key considerations:\n- Appropriate language level, examples, and complexity for a wide range of ages and backgrounds\n- Engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight for younger/middle school learners\n- Practical relevance, confidence-building, and flexibility for adult diploma seekers\n- Targeted modules and rapid feedback loops for credit recovery students\n- Tailored pathways for specialized/international students\n- Empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds for \"second-chance\" learners\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through the LearnStage LMS/SIS, which is a 100% online, asynchronous platform. Key features include:\n- AI tools like the BRYTE AI Tutor and AI Essay Grader\n- Competency-based education with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and student portals with real-time progress tracking and automated communications\n- Standards-aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks and videos (no physical books)\n- Real-time performance dashboards, success coaching, tutoring, and chatbot support\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content\n- Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt\n- Adapt the content appropriately for the diverse target learner profiles\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium\n- Preserve the original intent and style while enhancing the content\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review each instruction block marked by the special delimiters to understand the specific content request.\n2. Generate new content that fulfills the request, ensuring it matches the style, tone, and technical level of the existing document.\n3. Replace the entire instruction block (including the delimiters) with your generated content, making sure it flows naturally with the surrounding text.\n4. Pay close attention to the context provided by the paragraphs before and after each instruction block, as well as any formatting requirements mentioned.\n5. Maintain consistent terminology throughout the final output to preserve the document's cohesiveness.\n6. Adapt the content as needed to address the diverse target learner profiles, focusing on appropriate language, examples, and complexity.\n7. Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium, leveraging the features of the LearnStage LMS/SIS platform.\n8. Review the final output to ensure the educational integrity and core value of the original content have been maintained while addressing the enhancement requirements."
