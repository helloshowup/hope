This digital signature process ensures that guardians are fully informed about the nature of the fieldwork, potential risks, and educational benefits. This important step protects both students and the school while promoting transparent communication between Excel High School and families.\n\n## What is the Parent Sign-Off?\nThe Parent Sign-Off is a digital signature that legally documents a parent or guardian's approval for their student to participate in service fieldwork. This electronic form includes details about the specific fieldwork activity, location, duration, supervision, and any special requirements or considerations. By providing their digital signature, parents acknowledge they have reviewed this information and consent to their student's participation.\n\n## Why is a Digital Signature Required?\nA digital signature is required for several important reasons:\n\n1. **Legal Protection**: The signature serves as documentation that proper consent was obtained before a minor participated in off-campus activities.\n\n2. **Safety Assurance**: It confirms that parents are aware of where their student will be and what activities they'll be performing.\n\n3. **Communication Tool**: The process ensures parents receive complete information about educational activities occurring outside the traditional classroom.\n\n4. **Liability Management**: It helps Excel High School manage risk by ensuring all participants have proper authorization.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add one or two linking paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing.

  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
