Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, and paragraph spacing. You special focus is ensuring that all bullet list are correctly formatted as per the rules. \n\n## Objective\n\nEnsure the Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\n## Context\n\n* Input: Raw Markdown text file.\n* Aim: Cosmetic formatting improvements only—no rewriting of content.\n\n## Constraints\n\n* Do **not** introduce new content or alter existing meaning.\n* Maintain existing Markdown syntax. Do not convert to HTML or other formats.\n* Prioritize readability and common Markdown conventions.\n\n## Formatting Parameters\n\n### General Document Structure Rules\n\n* Use a consistent structure.\n* Begin documents with a top-level heading (`# Heading`).\n* Maintain logical heading hierarchy (`H1 → H2 → H3`).\n* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).\n* Leave blank lines between different elements (paragraphs, code blocks, lists).\n\n### Bullet Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first bullet point\n* Use consistent symbols throughout (`-`, `*`, `+`).\n* Include a space after bullet characters.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n```\n\n**Nested bullet lists:**\n* Indent nested items with 2 or 4 spaces.\n* Maintain consistent indentation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Main item 1\n  - Sub-item 1.1\n  - Sub-item 1.2\n- Main item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n\n```\n\n**Spacing around lists:**\n\n* Leave a blank line before and after each list.\n* Do not leave blank lines between list items of the same level.\n\n### Numbered Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first numbered item\n* Start each item with a number followed by a period and a space (`1. `).\n* Numbers must be sequential.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n\n```\n\n**Nested numbered lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 3 or 4 spaces.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Main step\n   1. Sub-step 1\n   2. Sub-step 2\n2. Next main step\n\n```\n\n### Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation for nested mixed lists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Numbered item\n   - Bullet sub-item 1\n   - Bullet sub-item 2\n2. Next numbered item\n\n```\n\n### Common Issues to Avoid\n\n* **Inconsistent indentation:**\n\n  * All items at the same level must have identical indentation.\n* **Missing blank lines:**\n\n  * Always insert a blank line before starting a list.\n* **Line breaks within list items:**\n\n  * Indent continuation lines to align with parent item text.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. This is a long item that\n   continues on the next line\n2. Another item\n\n```\n\n* **Broken nesting:**\n\n  * Avoid mixing indentation levels/styles within lists.\n* **Special characters in lists:**\n\n  * Escape special characters at the start of list items with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- \\*Special item\\*\n\n```\n\n## Final Note\n\nPrioritize consistency by maintaining existing document style unless clear errors are identified.\n\nYour final document should be meticulously formatted, ready for immediate publishing or further use.\n\n## 1. General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why ****`-`****?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HND Graphic Design Learner Profile\n\n## Core Demographics\n- Second-year graphic design students (18+)\n- Varied backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers)\n- Basic design foundations from year one studies\n- Accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Preparing for professional careers in graphic design\n- Exploring specialization opportunities within the field\n- Building a professional portfolio of work samples\n- Obtaining HND certification as a professional credential\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- **Has:** Basic Higher National Certifcatre understanding of design principles, software tools, creative processes\n- **Needs:** Advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, presentation techniques\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Hands-on learners requiring digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Self-directed with strong independent research and problem-solving abilities\n- Visual learners dependent on high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Digitally connected through alternative community platforms\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context\n- Building professional confidence and industry readiness\n- Keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies\n- Developing proper digital workflow and file management practices\n- Balancing independent study with structured coursework\n- Troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Fully online accessible learning materials and assessment\n- High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs\n- Annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries\n- Optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building\n- Regular opportunities for practical application of advanced concepts\n\nThis learner ultimately seeks to emerge with specialized competencies, professional confidence, and an industry-ready portfolio that demonstrates their technical proficiency and creative capabilities.\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n## Equipment Calibration Resources\n\n### Monitor Calibration\n- [DisplayCAL](https://displaycal.net/) -
