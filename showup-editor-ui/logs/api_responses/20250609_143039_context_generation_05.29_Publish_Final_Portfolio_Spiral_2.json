Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a meticulous Markdown Editor, specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing.\n\nObjective: To ensure the received Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\nContext: The input will be a raw Markdown text file. The aim is not to rewrite content, but rather to polish its presentation through formatting adjustments. You should avoid making any substantive changes to the actual text content.\n\nConstraints:\n\nDo not introduce new content or alter the meaning of the existing text. Your work is purely cosmetic formatting.\nMaintain existing Markdown syntax wherever possible. Avoid converting elements into HTML or other formats.\nPrioritize readability and common Markdown conventions. If ambiguities arise, err on the side of what is most commonly understood and used in Markdown.\nParameters:\n\nBulleted Lists: Ensure all bulleted lists use consistent syntax (either -, *, or + as the bullet point marker – if a style is already present, maintain it; otherwise, default to -). Ensure proper indentation for nested lists (using four spaces or a tab). Remove redundant or incorrectly placed bullet points. Verify that blank lines separate list items when appropriate for longer entries or to improve readability.\n\nHeadings: Confirm that headings are correctly formatted using the # symbol notation. Ensure there is a single space between the # symbols and the heading text. Verify correct heading levels are used according to the document's implied structure, correcting obvious errors (e.g. skipping heading levels). Confirm there is a blank line before and after each heading.\n\nParagraph Spacing: Ensure there is at least one blank line between paragraphs to create clear visual separation. Remove any excessive blank lines (more than two consecutive blank lines).\n\nSpaces: Ensure that only one space exists between words. Remove any double spaces.\n\nDetailed Guidance:\n\nAnalyze the entire document first to understand the general structure and formatting style currently used.\n\nAddress bulleted lists: Correct any inconsistencies in bullet point markers, indentation, and spacing.\n\nRefine headings: Ensure proper # syntax, spacing, heading levels, and spacing between heading and body.\n\nAdjust paragraph spacing: Add or remove blank lines to create consistent and visually appealing paragraph separation.\n\nDo not assume errors: Only make changes where there is a clear formatting issue according to standard Markdown conventions.\n\nPreserve special characters: Ensure special characters (e.g., *, _, >) that are intended for Markdown formatting are correctly used and escaped if needed. If these character are not intended for formatting, ensure that are properly escaped.\n\nPrioritize consistency: Maintain the existing style and conventions of the document unless there is a clear error.\n\nYour objective is to return a meticulously formatted Markdown document, ready for publishing or further use.\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# **EXCEL HIGH SCHOOL LEARNER PROFILE — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n### **Learner Segments**\n\n* **Traditional Achievers (14–18)** – College‑bound; want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self‑pacing.\n\n* **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)** – Juggle work/family; require extreme flexibility, confidence‑building, and practical relevance.\n\n* **Credit Recovery Students** – Short‑term, high‑pressure; benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n\n* **Homeschooling Families** – Seek accredited curriculum; parents act as co‑learners via the Parent Portal.\n\n* **Middle School Learners (11–14)** – Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n\n* **Specialized/International Students** – Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.; demand tailored pathways.\n\n* **“Second‑Chance” Learners** – Cross‑segment group; crave empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\n### **Platform Features (LearnStage LMS/SIS)**\n\n* 100 % online, asynchronous course delivery.\n\n* **AI tools:** BRYTE AI Tutor (real‑time help) & AI Essay Grader (instant formative feedback).\n\n* **Competency‑Based Education certified** – Mastery gating with multiple‑attempt assessments.\n\n* **Parent & Student Portals** with real‑time progress plus automated email/SMS “Dynamic Communications.”\n\n* Standards‑aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks & video (no physical books).\n\n* Real‑time performance dashboards; Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, chatbot support.\n\n### **Key Instructional Design Drivers**\n\n1. **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** multiple means of representation, action/expression, and engagement.\n\n2. **Scaffold & Spiral:** Bloom crawl inside lessons; revisit competencies later at higher rigor.\n\n3. **Mastery‑Led Feedback:** AI \\+ human rubric loops; clear formative → summative pathway.\n\n4. **Self‑Direction Aids:** time‑management nudges, study‑skills checkpoints, orientation refreshers.\n\n5. **Flexibility WITH Structure:** suggested pacing, clear navigation, early‑win tasks.\n\n6. **Community & Presence:** instructor announcements, parent check‑ins, optional peer forums.\n\n7. **Real‑World Choice:** project‑based STEM tasks, choice menus, and micro‑credential badges.\n\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 5.29 Publish Final Portfolio (Spiral 2)\n\n<!---edited-start-->What if you could capture your entire learning journey in a single, powerful showcase?
