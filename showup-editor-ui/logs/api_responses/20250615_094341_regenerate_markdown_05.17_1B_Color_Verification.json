Failure to meet color standards can lead to user exclusion, poor user experience, and potential legal compliance issues.\n\n### Color Profile Accuracy\n\nEnsure accurate color reproduction by:\n\n- Verifying colors are correctly set to CMYK or Pantone for print, RGB for digital\n- Calibrating computer screens to accurately represent final output\n- Understanding how uncalibrated screens can distort color perception\n- Implementing a defined color system for design consistency and efficiency\n\nA systematic approach to color management prevents mismatched colors, accessibility issues, and wasted resources when moving between digital and print environments.\n\n### Contrast Ratios for Accessibility\n\nMeet WCAG accessibility guidelines by ensuring:\n\n- Paragraph text maintains a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (AA compliance)\n- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold+) maintains a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio (AA)\n- For AAA compliance: 7:1 ratio for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text\n- Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify ratios\n- Test print materials in black and white to reveal potential contrast issues\n\nThe interplay between digital and print color considerations requires different approaches to quality control, as a design that appears perfect on a digital screen may print inaccurately if not properly prepared.\n\n### Functional Use of Color\n\nColor must serve functional purposes beyond aesthetics:\n\n- Never use color as the sole means of conveying information\n- Add underlines or icons to links (not just color)\n- Include text or symbols with colored indicators (e.g., error messages)\n- Test various color pairings for readability\n- Apply consistent color variations for interactive states (hover, clicked)\n\nThis ensures that all users, including those with visual impairments or color blindness, can successfully navigate and understand your design.\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a comprehensive guide on color verification and typography best practices for graphic design projects. It covers key considerations around color palette adherence, accessibility, consistency, and functional usage. The content also includes a detailed typography verification checklist addressing font usage, visual hierarchy, spacing, and accessibility.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe primary enhancement required is to carefully review the text and correct any non-British English spellings to their proper British equivalents. This includes changes such as:\n- '-our' instead of '-or' (e.g., 'colour' instead of 'color')\n- '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (e.g., 'organise' instead of 'organize')\n- '-re' instead of '-er' (e.g., 'centre' instead of 'center')\n- '-ogue' instead of '-og' (e.g., 'dialogue' instead of 'dialog')\n- '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (e.g., 'anaesthesia' instead of 'anesthesia')\n- Double 'l' in verb inflections (e.g., 'travelled' instead of 'traveled')\n- '-ement' instead of '-ment' (e.g., 'judgement' instead of 'judgment')\n- '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (e.g., 'learnt' instead of 'learned')\n\nThe content structure, formatting, and technical terminology should remain unchanged.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds. They have a solid foundation in design principles and software tools from their first-year studies, but need to develop advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, and presentation techniques.\n\nKey considerations for this audience:\n- Use language and examples appropriate for an advanced design audience\n- Maintain a professional, technical tone while ensuring clarity and accessibility\n- Provide ample visual demonstrations, annotated examples, and practical application opportunities\n- Accommodate both in-person and online/remote learning environments\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of in-person and online/asynchronous platforms. Ensure the content is fully accessible and optimized for digital delivery, with high-quality visuals and interactive elements where appropriate. Avoid overly prescriptive formatting changes unless specifically requested.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the educational integrity and technical accuracy of the original content\n- Ensure the content adheres to British English spelling conventions while maintaining the original structure and intent\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to suit the needs of the target HND Graphic Design learners\n- Optimize the content for effective delivery through both in-person and online/asynchronous learning environments\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the entire text and make the necessary spelling corrections to convert all non-British English spellings to their proper British equivalents, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n2. Ensure that all technical terms, formatting, and punctuation remain unchanged throughout the content.\n3. Evaluate the language, examples, and level of complexity to ensure they are appropriate for the target HND Graphic Design learners. Make any necessary adjustments to improve clarity and accessibility without altering the core content.\n4. Consider incorporating additional visual aids, such as annotated examples or step-by-step demonstrations, to enhance the learning experience for the visual-oriented target audience.\n5. Optimize the content for effective delivery through both in-person and online/asynchronous platforms, ensuring it is fully accessible and engaging for the learners.\n\nThe enhanced content should maintain the educational integrity and technical accuracy of the original while addressing the specific needs of the HND Graphic Design learners and adhering to British English spelling conventions.",
