Community service is most effective when it responds to genuine needs rather than assumptions about what might help. By identifying local challenges and considering how to address them with empathy, you'll develop valuable skills for creating meaningful community impact.\n\n## Activity Instructions\n\n### Identify a Local Challenge\nStart by observing your surroundings with fresh eyes. Every community has challenges that might go unnoticed in daily life. This exercise asks you to begin noticing these needs as a first step toward community engagement.\n\n- What simple issues do you notice in your neighborhood, school, or community?\n- Who might be affected by this challenge?\n- What basic factors might contribute to this issue?\n\n**Task:** Write a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing the challenge and why you believe it's important to address.\n\n> ### Example Approaches\n> \n> **Strong Example:** \n> ![Impact-vs-Feasibility matrix with 12 local issues ranked with color-coded rationale notes]\n> \n> This student created an impact-vs-feasibility matrix to assess various community issues they noticed. They identified 12 different challenges (including youth mental health resources, food insecurity among seniors, and lack of safe bike lanes), ranked each by potential impact and implementation feasibility, and added color-coded notes explaining their reasoning. This systematic approach helped them select the most promising issue to address.\n> \n> **Needs Improvement:**\n> * Litter in parks\n> * Homeless people downtown\n> * Not enough activities for teens\n> \n> This response simply lists three generic issues copied from the prompt without specific details about the local community, who is affected, or why these issues persist. The lack of specificity makes it difficult to develop a meaningful response.\n\n### Develop an Empathetic Response\nNow that you've identified a challenge, think about how you might address it while considering the people affected. This introduces the fundamental concept that effective community service involves understanding others' perspectives.\n\n- Consider how those affected might feel about the situation\n- Think about what basic resources might help address the issue\n- Focus on a simple, practical approach\n\n**Task:** Write 1-2 paragraphs explaining your proposed response and how it demonstrates empathy.\n\n### Peer Exchange and Feedback \nWhen you share perspectives, you enrich everyone's understanding of community challenges. Through exchanging ideas with peers, you'll gain insights that might not have occurred to you working alone. This collaborative approach mirrors how effective community organizations operate—drawing on diverse viewpoints to develop thorough solutions.\n\n### Peer Exchange and Feedback \nSharing ideas with others helps build a more complete understanding of community challenges. This foundational skill of exchanging perspectives will be essential as you progress to more complex community engagement work in future courses.\n\n- Share what you appreciate about their response\n- Ask one question about their approach\n- Offer one simple suggestion\n\nThe learning process doesn't end with creating a response—reflection deepens understanding and improves future efforts. Taking time to consider feedback and different perspectives helps refine approaches to community challenges. This final step transforms the activity from a simple assignment into a meaningful learning experience with lasting impact.\n\n**Task:** Write a short reflection (5-7 sentences) addressing:\n- What new insights did you gain through this exchange?\n- How might you refine your approach based on the feedback?\n\n### Reflection\nTaking time to think about what you've learned is an important part of the process. This basic reflection practice will be expanded in future coursework.\n\n**Task:** Write 3-5 sentences addressing:\n- What did you learn from this exercise?\n- How might you improve your approach?\n- What was interesting about hearing another perspective?\n\n3. Your reflection after feedback\n\n<br/>\nRemember, the goal of this activity isn't to solve complex social problems in one step, but to practice identifying needs through an empathetic lens and to learn from diverse perspectives. These skills form the foundation of meaningful community service.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you have questions or need assistance with this activity, reach out to your Success Coach or use the Excel High School tutoring center.\n\n\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a meticulous Markdown Editor, specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, headings, and paragraph spacing.\n\nObjective: To ensure the received Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\nContext: The input will be a raw Markdown text file. The aim is not to rewrite content, but rather to polish its presentation through formatting adjustments. You should avoid making any substantive changes to the actual text content.\n\nConstraints:\n\nDo not introduce new content or alter the meaning of the existing text. Your work is purely cosmetic formatting.\nMaintain existing Markdown syntax wherever possible. Avoid converting elements into HTML or other formats.\nPrioritize readability and common Markdown conventions. If ambiguities arise, err on the side of what is most commonly understood and used in Markdown.\nParameters:\n\nBulleted Lists: Ensure all bulleted lists use consistent syntax (either -, *, or + as the bullet point marker – if a style is already present, maintain it; otherwise, default to -). Ensure proper indentation for nested lists (using four spaces or a tab). Remove redundant or incorrectly placed bullet points. Verify that blank lines separate list items when appropriate for longer entries or to improve readability.\n\nHeadings: Confirm that headings are correctly formatted using the # symbol notation. Ensure there is a single space between the # symbols and the heading text. Verify correct heading levels are used according to the document's implied structure, correcting obvious errors (e.g. skipping heading levels). Confirm there is a blank line before and after each heading.\n\nParagraph Spacing: Ensure there is at least one blank line between paragraphs to create clear visual separation. Remove any excessive blank lines (more than two consecutive blank lines).\n\nSpaces: Ensure that only one space exists between words. Remove any double spaces.\n\nDetailed Guidance:\n\nAnalyze the entire document first to understand the general structure and formatting style currently used.\n\nAddress bulleted lists: Correct any inconsistencies in bullet point markers, indentation, and spacing.\n\nRefine headings: Ensure proper # syntax, spacing, heading levels, and spacing between heading and body.\n\nAdjust paragraph spacing: Add or remove blank lines to create consistent and visually appealing paragraph separation.\n\nDo not assume errors: Only make changes where there is a clear formatting issue according to standard Markdown conventions.\n\nPreserve special characters: Ensure special characters (e.g., *, _, >) that are intended for Markdown formatting are correctly used and escaped if needed. If these character are not intended for formatting, ensure that are properly escaped.\n\nPrioritize consistency: Maintain the existing style and conventions of the document unless there is a clear error.\n\nYour objective is to return a meticulously formatted Markdown document, ready for publishing or further use.\n",
