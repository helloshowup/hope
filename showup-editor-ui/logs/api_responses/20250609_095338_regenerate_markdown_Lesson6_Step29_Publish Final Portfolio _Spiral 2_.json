  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a step-by-step guide for students to create a final portfolio that demonstrates their learning and growth in the areas of Volunteer Opportunities, Leadership, and Empathy. It provides instructions on organizing the portfolio content, choosing the appropriate format (interactive PDF or digital website), and finalizing the portfolio before submission.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block, generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction, while ensuring the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material.\n3. Match the document's existing tone, style, and technical level, and avoid using first person.\n4. Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content include:\n- **Traditional Achievers (14-18)**: College-bound students who want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self-pacing.\n- **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)**: Learners who juggle work/family and require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance.\n- **Credit Recovery Students**: Short-term, high-pressure learners who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n- **Homeschooling Families**: Seek accredited curriculum, with parents acting as co-learners via the Parent Portal.\n- **Middle School Learners (11-14)**: Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n- **Specialized/International Students**: Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc. and demand tailored pathways.\n- **\"Second-Chance\" Learners**: Cross-segment group who crave an empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\nThe content should be adapted to suit the diverse needs of these learner segments, with a focus on clear structure, practical relevance, engaging multimedia, and scaffolded support.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for asynchronous online delivery through the LearnStage LMS/SIS platform, which includes the following features:\n- 100% online, asynchronous course delivery\n- AI tools like the BRYTE AI Tutor and AI Essay Grader\n- Competency-Based Education certification with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and Student Portals with real-time progress tracking and automated communications\n- Standards-aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks and videos (no physical books)\n- Real-time performance dashboards, Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, and chatbot support\n\nAny enhancements should leverage the platform's capabilities and adhere to the asynchronous, online-focused delivery model.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content, which is to guide students through the process of creating a comprehensive final portfolio.\n2. Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt, including identifying and enhancing all instruction blocks.\n3. Preserve the original content's value and flow, while adapting the language, examples, and complexity to suit the diverse target learner profiles.\n4. Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium, leveraging the platform's features and capabilities.\n5. Provide strategic guidance for improvement while ensuring the enhanced content reads as a cohesive, natural part of the original.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content and the enhancement prompt to fully understand the objectives and requirements.\n2. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n3. For each instruction block:\n   - Analyze the context and intent of the instruction.\n   - Generate relevant, thoughtful content that fulfills the instruction while maintaining the document's tone, style, and technical level.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material and preserves the original's educational value.\n   - Avoid using first person and maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness.\n4. Review the enhanced content to ensure it reads as a cohesive, natural part of the original document.\n5. Leverage the platform's features and capabilities (e.g., multimedia, AI tools, competency-based assessments) to optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery medium.\n6. Incorporate adaptations to suit the diverse target learner profiles, focusing on clear structure, practical relevance, engaging multimedia, and scaffolded support.\n7. Provide strategic guidance for improvement while preserving the core purpose and value of the original content.",
