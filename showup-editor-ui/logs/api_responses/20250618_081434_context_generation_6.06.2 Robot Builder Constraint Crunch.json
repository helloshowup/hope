Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it. These sensors help the robot make smart choices. For example, the robot can stop when it detects an object in its path.\"\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# Lesson: The Constraint-Requirement Balancing Act\n\n## What Did You Notice?\n\nWhen you tried to meet all requirements (carry ≥20 trays, include touchscreen), your constraint meters likely turned red—especially the budget. This reveals a fundamental challenge in engineering: **requirements push you to add more, while constraints force you to use less**.\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nRequirements are what your solution **must do**:\n- Carry 20+ trays\n- Include touchscreen interface\n\nConstraints are the **limits you can't exceed**:\n- Budget: $500 max\n- Width: 60cm max\n- Noise: 50dB max\n- Build time: 2 weeks max\n\nWhen these clash, you face impossible choices. Meeting all requirements often violates constraints, while staying within constraints may leave requirements unmet.\n\n## Real-World Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Negotiate Requirements**\n- \"Can we start with 15 trays and upgrade later?\"\n- \"Would a button interface work instead of touchscreen?\"\n- Challenge assumptions about what's truly necessary\n\n**Option 2: Adjust Constraints**\n- Request budget increase with clear justification\n- Negotiate extended timeline\n- Propose phased implementation\n\n**Option 3: Creative Engineering**\n- Find innovative ways to do more with less\n- Combine functions to reduce parts\n- Look for efficiency gains\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content. Insert this section after all main content and any activities/assessments, typically at the document end.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
