This final evaluation serves as a \"mastery gate\" where you'll demonstrate comprehensive understanding of course content and personal growth.

  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",

The content outlines the purpose, format options, time management guidelines, assessment rubric, and tips for successfully preparing the defense.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks within the Markdown document, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each instruction block:\n   - Carefully interpret the embedded request\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content to fulfill the instruction\n   - Replace the entire instruction block with the new content\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material\n   - Match the existing tone, style, and technical level\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks as needed for clean Markdown formatting\n\nThe goal is to create a cohesive Markdown document where the generated content reads as if it was always part of the original.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including:\n- Traditional Achievers (14-18): College-bound students seeking honors/AP rigor with clear structure for self-pacing\n- Adult Diploma Seekers (18+): Learners juggling work/family who require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance\n- Credit Recovery Students: Short-term, high-pressure learners who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops\n- Homeschooling Families: Seek accredited curriculum with parents acting as co-learners\n- Middle School Learners (11-14): Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight\n- Specialized/International Students: Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc. and demand tailored pathways\n- \"Second-Chance\" Learners: Crave an empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds\n\nThe content should be adapted to address the needs of this diverse audience, maintaining an appropriate tone, language level, and relevance.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for 100% online, asynchronous course delivery via the LearnStage LMS/SIS platform. Key features include:\n- AI tools like the BRYTE AI Tutor and AI Essay Grader\n- Competency-based education with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and Student Portals with real-time progress tracking\n- Standards-aligned digital courseware with multimedia resources (no physical books)\n- Real-time performance dashboards and various support services\n\nAny enhancements should consider the capabilities and limitations of this online learning environment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the Portfolio Defense assessment\n- Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt\n- Preserve the original content's value while adapting it for the target learner audience\n- Optimize the content for the asynchronous online learning medium\n- Provide strategic guidance for improvement while avoiding overly prescriptive formatting changes\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content to fully understand its structure, tone, and key elements.\n2. Identify all instruction blocks within the Markdown document, even if they are embedded or lack clear formatting.\n3. For each instruction block:\n   - Analyze the embedded request to determine the desired content\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction\n   - Replace the entire instruction block with the new content\n   - Ensure the new content flows naturally with the surrounding material\n   - Match the existing tone, style, and technical level\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks as needed for clean Markdown formatting\n4. Throughout the enhancement process, keep the target learner audience and online learning medium in mind. Adapt the content accordingly while preserving the original intent and value.\n5. Provide strategic guidance for improvement, focusing on optimizing the content for the learners' needs and the online learning environment.\n\nThe goal is to create a cohesive, learner-centric document that reads as if the generated content was always part of the original, while maintaining the educational integrity and core purpose of the Portfolio Defense assessment.",
