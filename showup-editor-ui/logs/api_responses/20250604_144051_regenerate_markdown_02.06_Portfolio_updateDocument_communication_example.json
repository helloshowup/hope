  "markdown_text": "# 2.6 Portfolio updateâ€”Document communication example\n\nIn this activity, you'll add a detailed entry to your portfolio that showcases your communication skills. Effective communication is a critical skill in both academic and professional settings. By documenting a specific example of your communication, you'll demonstrate your ability to interact effectively with others and provide concrete evidence of your communication competencies. This portfolio entry will serve as valuable evidence for your BC_COMM mastery assessment.\n\n## Adding Your Communication Example\n\n### Step 1: Select a Meaningful Communication Example\n\nChoose a recent situation where you communicated effectively. This could be:\n- A group project where you coordinated with team members\n- A presentation you delivered to classmates or colleagues\n- A written communication (email, report, letter) that achieved its purpose\n- A difficult conversation you navigated successfully\n- A time when you advocated for yourself or others\n\n**Pro Tip:** Select an example that demonstrates your strengths and shows growth in your communication abilities. Consider examples from school, work, or personal interactions that had meaningful outcomes.\n\n### Step 2: Document the Context (15-20% of your entry)\n\nIn your portfolio entry, begin by describing the situation:\n- When and where did this communication occur?\n- Who was involved in the communication?\n- What was the purpose or goal of the communication?\n- What challenges or considerations made this communication important?\n\n**Example:** \"In April 2023, I needed to request an extension on a major project from my instructor due to unexpected family circumstances. This required clear, professional communication while navigating a sensitive personal situation.\"\n\n### Step 3: Detail Your Actions (30-40% of your entry)\n\nExplain specifically what you did to communicate effectively:\n- What communication methods did you choose and why?\n- What specific techniques or strategies did you employ?\n- How did you adapt your communication style to the situation?\n- What preparation did you undertake before communicating?\n\n**Example:** \"I drafted a formal email explaining my situation concisely, being honest about my circumstances while maintaining appropriate boundaries. I proposed a specific new deadline and outlined my plan to complete the work. Before sending, I reviewed my message for tone and clarity.\"\n\n### Step 4: Describe the Outcomes (20-25% of your entry)\n\nDocument the results of your communication:\n- How did others respond to your communication?\n- What was the end result or resolution?\n- What impact did your communication have on the situation?\n- How did this experience affect your relationships with those involved?\n\n**Example:** \"My instructor responded positively, granting the extension and expressing appreciation for my proactive approach. I completed the project by my proposed deadline with high quality work. This experience strengthened my professional relationship with my instructor.\"\n\n### Step 5: Reflect on Your Learning (20-25% of your entry)\n\nConclude your entry with reflection:\n- What communication skills did this experience demonstrate?\n- What did you learn about effective communication?\n- How might you apply this learning to future situations?\n- What would you do differently next time?\n\n**Example:** \"This experience demonstrated my ability to communicate professionally during challenging circumstances. I learned that being direct, honest, and solution-focused leads to better outcomes than avoiding difficult conversations. In the future, I'll continue to prioritize clear communication when facing obstacles.\"\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n**Length:** Your portfolio entry should be 400-600 words total.\n\n**Format:** Use clear headings for each section (Context, Actions, Outcomes, Reflection).\n\n**Evidence:** If appropriate, you may include screenshots of written communications (with personal information redacted) or brief transcripts of verbal exchanges as supporting evidence.\n\n## Grading Criteria\n\nYour portfolio entry will be evaluated on:\n- Specificity of your example\n- Clear demonstration of effective communication techniques\n- Thoughtfulness of your reflection\n- Professional presentation\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter completing your portfolio entry, review it to ensure you've included all necessary components: context, actions, outcomes, and reflection. Your entry should be detailed enough to provide clear evidence of your communication skills while remaining concise and focused. This documentation will serve as valuable evidence of your mastery of business communication competencies.\n\n**Remember:** Strong portfolio entries include specific details rather than general statements. The more concrete your example, the more effectively it will demonstrate your communication abilities.\n\n**Need Help?** If you're struggling to identify a good communication example, reach out to your Success Coach through the Student Portal for guidance.\n",
  "instructions": "# Learning Objectives Insertion Engine for Markdown Content\n\n## System Role\nYou are an expert instructional designer specialized in making surgical edits to markdown educational content. Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3. Insert these objectives in the proper location without disrupting document structure\n4. Return the complete modified markdown with your surgical insertion\n\nCritical requirements:\n- ONLY modify the document by inserting the Learning Objectives section\n- Do NOT alter any existing content in any way\n- Maintain proper paragraph breaks (one empty line between sections)\n- Ensure objectives use appropriate action verbs and are directly tied to lesson content",
