  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an overview of a \"Team Pitch Session\" assignment for an entrepreneurship or business course. It outlines the learning objectives, preparation guidelines, presentation structure, and evaluation criteria for students to showcase a business opportunity they have developed as a team. The content provides a clear framework for the pitch session and highlights key elements students should focus on.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks within the Markdown document, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each instruction block:\n   - Carefully interpret the embedded request\n   - Generate relevant content to fulfill the instruction\n   - Replace the entire instruction block with the new content\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material\n   - Match the existing tone, style, and technical level\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks as needed for clean Markdown formatting\n\nThe goal is to create a cohesive Markdown document where the generated content reads as if it was always part of the original.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including:\n- **Traditional Achievers (14-18)**: College-bound students seeking honors/AP-level rigor with clear structure for self-pacing\n- **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)**: Learners juggling work/family who require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance\n- **Credit Recovery Students**: Short-term, high-pressure learners who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops\n- **Homeschooling Families**: Seeking accredited curriculum with strong guardian oversight\n- **Middle School Learners (11-14)**: Needing highly engaging, intuitive tasks with guardian support\n- **Specialized/International Students**: Enrolling for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc. and demanding tailored pathways\n- **\"Second-Chance\" Learners**: Across segments, craving an empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds\n\nThe content should be adapted to address the diverse needs, backgrounds, and learning preferences of these target segments.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through the Excel High School's 100% online, asynchronous LearnStage LMS/SIS platform. Key features include:\n- AI tools like the BRYTE AI Tutor and AI Essay Grader\n- Competency-based education with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and Student Portals with real-time progress tracking and automated communications\n- Standards-aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks and videos (no physical books)\n- Real-time performance dashboards, Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, and chatbot support\n\nAny enhancements should consider the capabilities and limitations of this online, asynchronous learning environment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. **Maintain Educational Integrity**: Preserve the core learning objectives, structure, and value of the original content.\n2. **Address Enhancement Prompt**: Fulfill the specific requirements outlined in the prompt, including identifying and enhancing all instruction blocks.\n3. **Adapt for Target Learners**: Tailor the content's language, examples, and complexity to meet the needs of the diverse learner segments.\n4. **Optimize for Online Delivery**: Ensure the enhanced content aligns with the features and constraints of the LearnStage LMS/SIS platform.\n5. **Enhance Cohesion and Flow**: Integrate the new content seamlessly into the existing document, maintaining a consistent tone, style, and technical level.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content to fully understand its purpose, structure, and key elements.\n2. Thoroughly analyze the enhancement prompt to identify all instruction blocks, even those embedded within paragraphs.\n3. For each instruction block:\n   - Interpret the request and determine the appropriate content to generate\n   - Craft new content that fulfills the instruction while preserving the original intent\n   - Integrate the new content smoothly into the surrounding material\n   - Ensure the language, examples, and complexity align with the target learner profile\n   - Consider any limitations or opportunities presented by the online, asynchronous learning medium\n4. Review the enhanced document as a whole to verify cohesion, flow, and alignment with the key considerations.\n5. Make any final adjustments to ensure the enhanced content reads as a natural, seamless part of the original.",
