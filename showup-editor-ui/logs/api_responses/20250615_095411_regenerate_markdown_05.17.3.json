  "markdown_text": "# Mockup Quality Assessment Guide\n\nThe Mockup Quality Assessment Guide offers a structured method for evaluating design mockups before moving to production. This systematic approach helps designs convey their intent clearly, satisfy technical needs, present content properly, and incorporate feedback—turning design from a reactive task into a strategic tool that links to business goals.\n\nWith this assessment method, teams can spot and fix design problems and usability issues early, which saves development costs, speeds up product launches, and improves user experience.\n\n## Assessment Structure\n\n### 1. Visual Accuracy Evaluation\n**Purpose:** Judge how well the mockup captures the intended design\n\n**Assessment Criteria:**\n- Design element fidelity (typography, colours, imagery)\n- Proportional accuracy\n- Visual hierarchy representation\n- Stylistic consistency with brand guidelines\n- Lighting and shadow effects accuracy\n- Material representation quality\n\n**Verification Process:**\n- Compare mockup against design specifications\n- Review against approved style guides\n- Evaluate from multiple viewing distances\n- Check under different lighting conditions\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n- Note any visual discrepancies\n- Document approved visual exceptions\n- Record verification completion\n\n### 2. Technical Feasibility Verification\n**Purpose:** Confirm that the design can be implemented as shown in the mockup\n\n**Assessment Criteria:**\n- Production method compatibility\n- Material limitations consideration\n- Size and scale accuracy\n- Technical specification adherence\n- Production cost alignment\n- Timeline feasibility\n\n**Key Technical Considerations:**\n- **Platform Constraints:** Check designs match target platform capabilities (mobile, web, email clients) based on solid understanding of the technology stack\n- **Responsive Design:** Include designs for both mobile and desktop so content adapts across all screen sizes, accounting for extreme viewports\n- **Performance Implications:** Consider image optimisation (background images under 500kb), animation complexity, and backend processing requirements\n- **Development Efficiency:** Favour designs that translate well into HTML/CSS rather than relying on static images\n- **Component Reusability:** Design with reusable patterns (menus, buttons, links) to support a component-based system for developers\n- **Data Handling:** Test designs with data extremes so the interface handles diverse user inputs\n- **Browser/Client Support:** Verify compatibility with various browsers and email clients for specific design elements\n- **Scalability:** Make certain the design structure adapts for future features and content expansion\n\n**Verification Process:**\n- Consult with production specialists\n- Review against technical constraints\n- Check measurements and specifications\n- Verify production methods\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n- Document technical limitations\n- Record required modifications\n- Note production considerations\n\n### 3. Content Representation Review\n**Purpose:** Verify placeholder content is realistic and appropriate\n\n**Assessment Criteria:**\n- Text content accuracy and appropriateness\n- Image placeholder relevance\n- Data visualisation accuracy\n- Content hierarchy clarity\n- Information density appropriateness\n- Localisation considerations\n\n**Content Quality Factors:**\n- **Accuracy and Clarity:** Content should be clear, set appropriate expectations, and guide users\n- **Legibility:** Text should be readable at different sizes and against various backgrounds\n- **Grammar & Spelling:** All content must be error-free to maintain professionalism and credibility\n- **Strategic Placeholder Use:** Use placeholders in early stages but add realistic content within the first two iterations\n- **Conciseness:** Copy should be clear and accessible, suited to an 8th-grade reading level, without specialised jargon\n- **Localisation Readiness:** Account for text expansion (allow 2x length), character support, and cultural inclusivity\n- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Consider colour meanings across cultures and support for text directionality (RTL languages)\n\n**Verification Process:**\n- Review all text elements\n- Check image placeholders for relevance\n- Verify information architecture\n- Assess readability and legibility\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n- Document content issues\n- Note required content updates\n- Record content verification completion\n\n### 4. Stakeholder Feedback Integration\n**Purpose:** Verify that all feedback has been addressed\n\n**Assessment Criteria:**\n- Feedback implementation completeness\n- Conflicting feedback resolution\n- Feedback prioritisation appropriateness\n- Change documentation accuracy\n- Approval status clarity\n\n**Verification Process:**\n- Compare against feedback log\n- Review change history\n- Confirm with stakeholders\n- Document outstanding items\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n- Maintain feedback tracking log\n- Document resolution decisions\n- Record approval confirmations\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a \"Mockup Quality Assessment Guide\" that outlines a structured approach for evaluating design mockups before moving to production. It covers four key assessment areas: visual accuracy, technical feasibility, content representation, and stakeholder feedback integration. The guide provides detailed criteria, verification processes, and documentation requirements for each assessment area.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key enhancement requirement is to carefully check the text and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings, while preserving the original content, structure, and formatting. Specific guidelines include:\n\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to common spelling differences (e.g. '-our' instead of '-or', '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze', '-re' instead of '-er', etc.)\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds. They are preparing for professional careers and seeking to build an industry-ready portfolio. Key considerations for this audience include:\n\n- Appropriate language level, examples, and complexity to match their design foundations and advanced skill development needs\n- Visual learning preferences, requiring high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Hands-on, self-directed learning style with a need for digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context, building confidence and industry readiness\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through limited in-person and online platforms, with a focus on fully online accessible learning materials and assessment. Considerations include:\n\n- Ensuring the content is optimized for digital delivery and self-paced learning\n- Providing high-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs to support the visual learning preferences\n- Incorporating annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries to enhance the learning experience\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the Mockup Quality Assessment Guide\n- Preserve the original content's structure, formatting, and technical terminology\n- Ensure the spelling corrections align with British English conventions while making the minimum necessary changes\n- Adapt the language, examples, and complexity to suit the target learner's skill level and learning preferences\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the entire content and identify any words or phrases that require British English spelling corrections.\n2. Make precise, surgical edits to convert the identified spellings to their British English equivalents, following the provided guidelines.\n3. Ensure that all formatting, layout, punctuation, and technical terminology remain unchanged throughout the content.\n4. Verify that the corrected content maintains the original educational value and clarity for the target learner audience.\n5. Provide a final review to confirm that the content has been enhanced with the necessary British English spelling updates while preserving the overall integrity and structure.",
