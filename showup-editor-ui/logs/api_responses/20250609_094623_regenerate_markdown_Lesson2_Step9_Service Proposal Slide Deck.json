  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a guide for creating a 5-slide service proposal presentation. It outlines the core elements that should be included, such as a title and team introduction, community need assessment, service plan overview, leadership structure, and implementation/follow-up details. The guide also provides design tips and a submission checklist.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks you to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks within the content, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block, generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction, while ensuring the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material.\n3. Replace the entire instruction block, including the delimiters, with your generated content.\n4. Maintain the document's existing tone, style, and technical level, avoiding the use of first person.\n5. Insert spacing or line breaks as needed to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including:\n- **Traditional Achievers (14-18)**: College-bound students who want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self-pacing.\n- **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)**: Learners who juggle work/family and require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance.\n- **Credit Recovery Students**: Learners in a short-term, high-pressure environment who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n- **Homeschooling Families**: Learners who seek accredited curriculum, with parents acting as co-learners via the Parent Portal.\n- **Middle School Learners (11-14)**: Learners who need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n- **Specialized/International Students**: Learners who enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc. and demand tailored pathways.\n- **\"Second-Chance\" Learners**: A cross-segment group who crave an empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\nThe content should be adapted to address the needs of this diverse learner population, using appropriate language, examples, and complexity levels.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for asynchronous online delivery through the LearnStage LMS/SIS platform. This means the content must be optimized for self-paced, digital learning, leveraging features such as:\n- AI tools (BRYTE AI Tutor, AI Essay Grader)\n- Competency-based education with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and Student Portals with real-time progress tracking and automated communications\n- Multimedia textbooks, video content, and other digital resources (no physical books)\n- Real-time performance dashboards, Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, and chatbot support\n\nAny enhancements should consider the limitations and opportunities presented by this online, asynchronous learning environment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the content, which is to guide learners in creating an effective service proposal slide deck.\n2. Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt, such as identifying and replacing instruction blocks with generated content.\n3. Preserve the original content's value and structure while adapting it to the target learner population and the online, asynchronous learning medium.\n4. Ensure the enhanced content reads as a cohesive, natural, and well-structured document, without any obvious signs of AI-generated content.\n5. Optimize the content for accessibility, engagement, and self-directed learning.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content and the enhancement prompt to fully understand the requirements.\n2. Identify all instruction blocks within the content, even if they are embedded or lack clear formatting.\n3. For each instruction block, generate relevant, thoughtful content that fulfills the request while maintaining the document's tone, style, and technical level.\n4. Replace the entire instruction block, including the delimiters, with your generated content, ensuring it flows seamlessly with the surrounding material.\n5. Consider the diverse target learner population and their needs, adapting the language, examples, and complexity as appropriate.\n6. Optimize the content for the online, asynchronous learning environment, leveraging the available platform features and addressing any limitations.\n7. Review the enhanced content to ensure it maintains educational integrity, addresses the enhancement requirements, and reads as a cohesive, well-structured document.",
