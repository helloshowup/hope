  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational checklist for verifying alignment in graphic design layouts. It covers key principles and best practices related to grid systems, element positioning, text alignment, visual balance, and responsive design considerations. The content is structured as a series of checklist items that designers can use to evaluate and optimize the alignment of their designs.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe primary enhancement required is to convert all American English spellings to their British English equivalents throughout the content. This includes changes such as:\n- '-our' instead of '-or' (e.g. 'colour', 'favour', 'humour')\n- '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (e.g. 'organise', 'analyse')\n- '-re' instead of '-er' (e.g. 'centre', 'litre')\n- '-ogue' instead of '-og' (e.g. 'catalogue', 'dialogue')\n- '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (e.g. 'anaesthesia', 'oestrogen')\n- Double 'l' in verb inflections (e.g. 'travelled', 'modelling')\n- '-ement' instead of '-ment' (e.g. 'judgement')\n- '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (e.g. 'burnt', 'learnt')\n\nThe content structure, formatting, and technical terminology should remain unchanged.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds. They have a basic understanding of design principles and software tools, but need to develop advanced mastery of industry-standard skills, responsive design, digital prototyping, project management, and client communication.\n\nThe content should be adapted to:\n- Use language and examples appropriate for this level of graphic design student\n- Provide clear, concise explanations of alignment principles and best practices\n- Incorporate visual demonstrations and annotated examples to support learning\n- Offer opportunities for practical application of concepts through exercises or projects\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of limited in-person and online platforms. Considerations for the online delivery include:\n- Ensuring the content is fully accessible and optimized for digital consumption\n- Incorporating high-quality visuals, video walkthroughs, and interactive elements\n- Providing opportunities for community building and virtual collaboration\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and practical value of the original content\n- Ensure the content is easy to understand and apply for the target learners\n- Preserve the original structure, formatting, and technical terminology\n- Optimize the content for effective delivery through the specified learning medium\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the content and identify all instances of American English spellings that need to be converted to British English equivalents.\n2. Make the necessary spelling corrections while preserving the original formatting, layout, and punctuation.\n3. Review the content to ensure the language, examples, and level of detail are appropriate for the target HND Graphic Design learners.\n4. Incorporate visual aids, such as annotated examples and video demonstrations, to enhance the learners' understanding of the alignment principles and best practices.\n5. Consider adding optional \"Over to You\" sections or virtual meetups to encourage practical application and community building among the learners.\n6. Ensure the enhanced content is fully accessible and optimized for effective delivery through the specified online and in-person learning platforms.\n\nThe goal is to provide a comprehensive, learner-centric resource that maintains the educational value of the original content while addressing the specific needs of the HND Graphic Design students and the constraints of the learning medium.",
