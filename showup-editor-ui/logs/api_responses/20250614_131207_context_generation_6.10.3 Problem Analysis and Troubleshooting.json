General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why `-`?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# Target Audience Profile: Foundations of Robotics Course\n\n## Audience Summary\n- **Age Range:** 11-14 years old (grades 6-8)\n- **Educational Setting:** Excel Middle School's online curriculum (asynchronous, no peer interaction)\n- **Reading Level:** 5th-6th grade on Flesch-Kincaid scale\n- **Location:** Global student population\n- **Language:** English-speaking students\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Varying exposure to STEM concepts, possibly first formal robotics exposure\n- **Learning Style:** Visual demonstrations, simple explanations, hands-on activities\n- **Technology Access:** Varying access to physical robotics equipment\n\n## Content Creation Guidelines\n\n### Language and Readability\n- Keep content at 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use everyday words familiar to 11-12 year olds\n- Limit sentences to 15-20 words\n- Write in active voice and present tense\n- Use direct instructions starting with action verbs\n- Avoid jargon; define necessary technical terms immediately\n\n### Structure and Organization\n- One idea per paragraph (3-5 sentences maximum)\n- Use frequent headings and subheadings\n- Break instructions into numbered steps\n- Use bullet points for related information\n- Create clear \"chunks\" of information with visual breaks\n\n### Visual Elements\n- Include relevant images with each new concept\n- Use diagrams to show relationships between ideas\n- Add labeled illustrations for robot parts or tools\n- Include visual examples of completed steps\n\n### Engagement Strategies\n- Connect to real-world examples familiar to middle schoolers\n- Use conversational, friendly tone (\"Let's try...\" rather than \"Students will...\")\n- Include \"Stop and Think\" moments for processing information\n- Use storytelling elements to make technical concepts relatable\n\n### Formatting Best Practices\n- Bold important terms when first introduced\n- Use ample white space between sections\n- Create highlighted call-out boxes for important warnings or tips\n- Use consistent formatting for similar types of information\n\n### Sample Transformation\n**Too Complex:** \"The integration of multiple sensors facilitates environmental perception, enabling the robot to execute conditional decision-making algorithms based on input stimuli.\"\n\n**Better (6th Grade Level):** \"When we add sensors to our robot, it can 'see' what's around it.

When your robot doesn't perform as expected, it's not a failure—it's an opportunity to learn! Troubleshooting is a normal and valuable part of the engineering process that gives you deeper insights into your robot. Let's explore how to tackle problems in an organized way instead of through random guesswork or frustration.\n\nThis section covers structured approaches to identifying and resolving issues discovered during robot testing.\n\n### Identifying Failure Points\n\nIf your robot isn't functioning as intended, locating the source of the problem is your first task. Begin by dividing your robot into systems: mechanical (structure, moving parts), electrical (power, wiring), and programming (code, logic).\n\nTest each system independently when possible. For mechanical issues, check if parts move without restriction, if components are loose, or if elements are correctly aligned. For electrical problems, verify connections are secure, batteries are charged, and no wires are damaged. For programming issues, try running simplified versions of your code to isolate which parts work and which don't.\n\nA helpful technique is the \"half-split\" method: if you're not sure which of ten components has a problem, test in the middle (component #5). If that works, the problem is in components #6-10. If it doesn't, the problem is in components #1-5. Keep dividing the suspicious area in half until you find the exact failure point.\n\nRemember to check the obvious things first! Many \"complex\" problems turn out to be simple issues like a loose wire, low battery, or a sensor that's been bumped out of position.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nRoot cause analysis involves looking beyond the obvious symptom to discover why the problem happened in the first place. For example, if your robot keeps veering to the left, the symptom is the turning, but the root cause could be:\n- Uneven wheel sizes\n- More friction on one side\n- Unbalanced weight distribution\n- A programming error in the steering calculations\n- A motor that's weaker on one side\n\nA useful technique is the \"Five Whys\" method. Start with the problem and keep asking \"why\" until you reach the fundamental cause. For example:\n\n1. Why is the robot veering left? Because the right wheel is turning faster.\n2. Why is the right wheel turning faster? Because the left wheel has more resistance.\n3. Why does the left wheel have more resistance? Because the wheel isn't aligned correctly.\n4. Why isn't the wheel aligned? Because the mounting bracket is bent.\n5. Why is the bracket bent? Because the material is too thin for the robot's weight.\n\nNow you know you need a stronger bracket, not just a programming fix that compensates for the turning!\n\n### Structured Debugging Approaches\n\nWhen tackling robot problems, a methodical approach saves time and reduces frustration. Consider yourself a problem-solver gathering information rather than making random guesses about what might be wrong.\n\nFor mechanical debugging:\n- Isolate moving parts and test them one by one\n- Look for interference between components\n- Check for loose or overtightened connections\n- Verify that parts are in correct alignment\n\nFor electrical debugging:\n- Test power sources first (batteries, connections)\n- Use a multimeter if available to check voltages\n- Verify that all connections are secure\n- Look for shorts or damaged wires\n\nFor programming debugging:\n- Add \"debug prints\" to show values at different points in your code\n- Comment out sections to see if problems disappear\n- Test simple commands to verify basic functionality\n- Check sensor readings to make sure they're providing accurate data\n\nDocument everything you try and the results you observe. This prevents you from trying the same unsuccessful fix twice and helps you spot patterns that might reveal the underlying problem.\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a test where your robot didn't perform as expected. What did this failure teach you about your design assumptions? Reflect on how this unexpected outcome revealed gaps in your understanding of the problem.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Troubleshooting is a structured process that involves identifying failure points in mechanical, electrical, and programming systems, then testing each component in a logical sequence.\n- The \"Five Whys\" technique helps find the root cause of problems by asking why a problem occurs until you reach the fundamental issue that needs fixing.\n- Documenting all troubleshooting attempts and results prevents repeating unsuccessful fixes and helps identify patterns that reveal underlying problems.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n</CONTENT>\n",
