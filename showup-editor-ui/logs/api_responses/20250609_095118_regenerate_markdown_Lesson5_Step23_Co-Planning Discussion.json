  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",

Their input might help you identify potential challenges, refine your focus, or even expand your thinking in new directions.\n\n## Steps to Invite Guardian Comment\n**Prepare Your Project Scope**\n\nHaving a well-defined project scope is essential before seeking input from others. Think of your project scope as a roadmap that outlines where you're going and how you plan to get there. When your guardian can clearly see your vision and planning process, they can provide more targeted and helpful feedback that addresses your specific needs.\n\n   Before inviting your guardian's input, make sure your project scope is clearly articulated. Include the project objectives, key questions you're exploring, resources you plan to use, and your timeline. The more clearly you can explain your project, the more meaningful feedback you'll receive.\n**Access the Guardian Communication Feature**\n\nOnce your project scope is ready for review, the next step is to navigate to the appropriate section of the Excel High School portal. The platform is designed to facilitate seamless communication between students and guardians, making it easy to share academic work and receive feedback. This digital collaboration space ensures that important conversations about your educational progress are documented and accessible.\n\n   * Log into your Excel High School student portal\n   * Navigate to \"My Courses\" and select your current project course\n   * Click on the \"Guardian Collaboration\" tab in the left navigation menu\n**Compose a Clear Invitation Message**\n\nEffective communication is key when requesting feedback. Your invitation message sets the tone for the collaboration and helps your guardian understand exactly what kind of input would be most valuable to you. Being specific about what you need helps focus their attention on the areas where their perspective will have the greatest impact on your project's development.\n\n**Compose a Clear Invitation Message**\n   Write a brief but specific message to your guardian explaining:\n   - What the project is about\n   - What aspects you'd particularly like feedback on\n   - Any specific questions you have\n   - When you hope to receive their input\n\n   **Example Message Template:**\n   ```\n   Hi [Guardian Name],\n\n   I've started planning my [subject] project on [topic].

This follow-through is an important part of the learning experience and shows respect for the time and effort your guardian has invested in supporting your academic work.\n\n**Follow Up and Apply Feedback**\n   * Send a text message or email alert to notify your guardian about the portal invitation\n   * Once they provide feedback, review their comments carefully\n   * Respond to their input through the portal with any follow-up questions\n   * Incorporate relevant suggestions into your project scope\n   * Thank your guardian for their contribution and share how their input helped\n\n## Tips for Successful Guardian Collaboration\n* Schedule a specific time to discuss the project if complex feedback is needed\n* Be open to perspectives that might differ from your initial vision\n* Remember that you make the final decisions about your project\n* Use this as an opportunity to practice professional communication skills\n\nRemember, this collaboration process is designed to enhance your learning experience while building stronger communication with your support network at home."
