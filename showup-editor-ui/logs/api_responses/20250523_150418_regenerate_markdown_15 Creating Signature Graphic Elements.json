  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content consists of two downloadable resources - a Grid System Implementation Guide and a Pattern Scaling Worksheet. These resources are designed to help graphic design students develop systematic design approaches for creating professional brand identities. The content covers essential techniques for establishing consistent grid systems and scalable brand patterns.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key enhancement requirement is to carefully check the text and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. This includes changes such as:\n- '-our' instead of '-or' (e.g., 'colour' instead of 'color')\n- '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (e.g., 'organise' instead of 'organize')\n- '-re' instead of '-er' (e.g., 'centre' instead of 'center')\n- '-ogue' instead of '-og' (e.g., 'dialogue' instead of 'dialog')\n- '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (e.g., 'anaesthesia' instead of 'anesthesia')\n- Double 'l' in verb inflections (e.g., 'travelled' instead of 'traveled')\n- '-ement' instead of '-ment' (e.g., 'judgement' instead of 'judgment')\n- '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (e.g., 'learnt' instead of 'learned')\n\nThe enhancement must preserve the original content, structure, and formatting while making the minimum number of changes necessary to align the spelling with British English conventions.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds. They have a basic understanding of design principles and software tools from their first-year studies, but they need to develop advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, and presentation techniques.\n\nThese learners are hands-on, self-directed, and visual learners who require digital alternatives to practical exercises. They are digitally connected and seek to bridge the gap between theory and practice in a professional context, building confidence and industry readiness.\n\nThe content should be adapted to the learners' needs by:\n- Maintaining a clear, concise, and accessible writing style\n- Providing high-quality visual demonstrations and examples\n- Incorporating opportunities for practical application of concepts\n- Offering optional discussion and virtual meetup opportunities for community building\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for asynchronous online delivery, with learners accessing the materials through limited in-person and online platforms. The downloadable resources should be optimized for digital consumption, with a focus on clear instructions, visual examples, and interactive elements (such as the sketching areas in the Pattern Scaling Worksheet).\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Preserve the educational integrity and core value of the original content\n- Ensure the content remains relevant and applicable to the target learner's needs\n- Maintain the original structure, formatting, and layout of the resources\n- Correct only the non-British spellings while preserving all other content\n- Avoid making any changes beyond the required spelling corrections\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content to identify all instances of non-British spellings that need to be corrected.\n2. Make the necessary spelling changes to align the text with British English conventions, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n3. Verify that all formatting, layout, and punctuation remain intact and unchanged.\n4. Ensure that any technical terms with standard spellings are preserved as-is.\n5. Conduct a final review to confirm that the content maintains its original educational value and structure while adhering to British English spelling standards.\n\nThe enhanced content should serve as a seamless continuation of the original resources, with the only visible changes being the corrected spellings. The preparatory context provided here should guide the enhancement process to ensure the final product effectively meets the needs of the target learners.",
