These are the parts that let robots actually do useful work!\n\n### Motors and Movement\n\n**Motors** are the muscles of a robot, converting electrical energy into movement. Different types of motors serve different purposes in robotics:\n\n- **DC motors** provide continuous rotation and are often used in wheels for robot vehicles\n- **Servo motors** can move to precise positions and hold there, making them perfect for robot arms and joints\n- **Stepper motors** move in small, exact steps and are used when very precise movement is needed\n\nThe way motors are arranged determines how a robot moves. Wheeled robots typically use two or more motors connected to wheels, allowing them to drive forward, backward, and turn. Walking robots use multiple motors to control leg joints, creating more complex but versatile movement. Some robots use tracks (like a tank), propellers (for underwater or flying robots), or even special wheels that can climb stairs.\n\nMotors don't work alone - they need mechanical parts like gears, belts, and linkages to transfer their power effectively. Gears can increase a motor's strength (torque) or speed, while linkages can convert rotational motion into other types of movement.\n\n### Grippers and Manipulators\n\nFor robots that need to interact with objects, **grippers** and **manipulators** serve as hands. These end effectors come in many designs based on what the robot needs to handle. Some use simple pincer-like grippers with two opposing \"fingers\" that can open and close. Others have multiple fingers that can wrap around objects of different shapes.\n\nSpecialized grippers might use suction cups to pick up smooth objects, magnets for metal items, or soft, flexible materials for handling delicate objects. The most advanced robot hands can mimic human dexterity, with multiple joints in each finger and pressure sensors to control grip strength.\n\n**Robot arms** connect these grippers to the robot's body and provide the range of motion needed to reach objects. Like human arms, robot arms typically have multiple joints (called axes) that allow them to move in different directions. Industrial robot arms often have six or more axes, giving them the flexibility to reach almost any position within their workspace.\n\n### Other Action Components\n\nRobots communicate and interact with their environment through more than just movement:\n\n- **Speakers** allow robots to produce sounds and speech, helping them communicate with humans\n- **Lights** can signal a robot's status or intentions - for example, a red light might indicate low battery, while a green light shows the robot is ready for a command\n- **Displays** like screens can show more detailed information, including text, images, or even facial expressions for social robots\n\nSome robots use specialized output devices like printers, water pumps, or heating elements depending on their specific tasks.\n\nEven simple indicators like buzzers or vibration motors can be important output components, alerting users to important information or providing feedback when the robot completes a task.\n\n## Activity 2: Design Your Robot\n\nSketch a simple robot designed for a specific task of your choosing (like cleaning your room, helping in a hospital, or exploring Mars). Label each component according to whether it serves as input (sensing), processing (thinking), or output (acting). For each component, write a brief note explaining why it's necessary for your robot's intended purpose. This exercise will help you apply the input-processing-output framework to practical robot design.\n\n> **Key Takeaways**\n> \n> Robots use sensors (like light, sound, touch, and distance sensors) as their \"eyes and ears\" to understand the world around them.\n> \n> The processing system acts as the robot's \"brain,\" using software to interpret data and decide what to do next.\n> \n> Actuators (such as motors, speakers, and lights) are the robot's \"muscles\" that allow it to move and interact with its environment.",
  "instructions": "# Learning Objectives Insertion Engine for Markdown Content\n\n## System Role\nYou are an expert instructional designer specialized in making surgical edits to markdown educational content. Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets.
