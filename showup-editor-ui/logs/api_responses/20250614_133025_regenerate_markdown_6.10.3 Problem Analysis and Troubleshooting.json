When your robot doesn't perform as expected, it's not a failure—it's an opportunity to learn! Troubleshooting is a normal and valuable part of the engineering process that gives you deeper insights into your robot. Let's explore how to tackle problems in an organized way instead of through random guesswork or frustration.\n\nThis section covers structured approaches to identifying and resolving issues discovered during robot testing.\n\n### Identifying Failure Points\n\nIf your robot isn't functioning as intended, locating the source of the problem is your first task. Begin by dividing your robot into systems: mechanical (structure, moving parts), electrical (power, wiring), and programming (code, logic).\n\nTest each system independently when possible. For mechanical issues, check if parts move without restriction, if components are loose, or if elements are correctly aligned. For electrical problems, verify connections are secure, batteries are charged, and no wires are damaged. For programming issues, try running simplified versions of your code to isolate which parts work and which don't.\n\nA helpful technique is the \"half-split\" method: if you're not sure which of ten components has a problem, test in the middle (component #5). If that works, the problem is in components #6-10. If it doesn't, the problem is in components #1-5. Keep dividing the suspicious area in half until you find the exact failure point.\n\nRemember to check the obvious things first! Many \"complex\" problems turn out to be simple issues like a loose wire, low battery, or a sensor that's been bumped out of position.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\nRoot cause analysis involves looking beyond the obvious symptom to discover why the problem happened in the first place. For example, if your robot keeps veering to the left, the symptom is the turning, but the root cause could be:\n- Uneven wheel sizes\n- More friction on one side\n- Unbalanced weight distribution\n- A programming error in the steering calculations\n- A motor that's weaker on one side\n\nA useful technique is the \"Five Whys\" method. Start with the problem and keep asking \"why\" until you reach the fundamental cause. For example:\n\n1. Why is the robot veering left? Because the right wheel is turning faster.\n2. Why is the right wheel turning faster? Because the left wheel has more resistance.\n3. Why does the left wheel have more resistance? Because the wheel isn't aligned correctly.\n4. Why isn't the wheel aligned? Because the mounting bracket is bent.\n5. Why is the bracket bent? Because the material is too thin for the robot's weight.\n\nNow you know you need a stronger bracket, not just a programming fix that compensates for the turning!\n\n### Structured Debugging Approaches\n\nWhen tackling robot problems, a methodical approach saves time and reduces frustration. Consider yourself a problem-solver gathering information rather than making random guesses about what might be wrong.\n\nFor mechanical debugging:\n- Isolate moving parts and test them one by one\n- Look for interference between components\n- Check for loose or overtightened connections\n- Verify that parts are in correct alignment\n\nFor electrical debugging:\n- Test power sources first (batteries, connections)\n- Use a multimeter if available to check voltages\n- Verify that all connections are secure\n- Look for shorts or damaged wires\n\nFor programming debugging:\n- Add \"debug prints\" to show values at different points in your code\n- Comment out sections to see if problems disappear\n- Test simple commands to verify basic functionality\n- Check sensor readings to make sure they're providing accurate data\n\nDocument everything you try and the results you observe. This prevents you from trying the same unsuccessful fix twice and helps you spot patterns that might reveal the underlying problem.\n\n### Stop and Reflect\n**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a test where your robot didn't perform as expected. What did this failure teach you about your design assumptions? Reflect on how this unexpected outcome revealed gaps in your understanding of the problem.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n- Troubleshooting is a structured process that involves identifying failure points in mechanical, electrical, and programming systems, then testing each component in a logical sequence.\n- The \"Five Whys\" technique helps find the root cause of problems by asking why a problem occurs until you reach the fundamental issue that needs fixing.\n- Documenting all troubleshooting attempts and results prevents repeating unsuccessful fixes and helps identify patterns that reveal underlying problems.",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Prompt\n\nYou are a meticulous Markdown Editor specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, and paragraph spacing. You special focus is ensuring that all bullet list are correctly formatted as per the rules. \n\n## Objective\n\nEnsure the Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\n## Context\n\n* Input: Raw Markdown text file.\n* Aim: Cosmetic formatting improvements only—no rewriting of content.\n\n## Constraints\n\n* Do **not** introduce new content or alter existing meaning.\n* Maintain existing Markdown syntax. Do not convert to HTML or other formats.\n* Prioritize readability and common Markdown conventions.\n\n## Formatting Parameters\n\n### General Document Structure Rules\n\n* Use a consistent structure.\n* Begin documents with a top-level heading (`# Heading`).\n* Maintain logical heading hierarchy (`H1 → H2 → H3`).\n* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).\n* Leave blank lines between different elements (paragraphs, code blocks, lists).\n\n### Bullet Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first bullet point\n* Use consistent symbols throughout (`-`, `*`, `+`).\n* Include a space after bullet characters.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n```\n\n**Nested bullet lists:**\n* Indent nested items with 2 or 4 spaces.\n* Maintain consistent indentation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Main item 1\n  - Sub-item 1.1\n  - Sub-item 1.2\n- Main item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n\n```\n\n**Spacing around lists:**\n\n* Leave a blank line before and after each list.\n* Do not leave blank lines between list items of the same level.\n\n### Numbered Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first numbered item\n* Start each item with a number followed by a period and a space (`1. `).\n* Numbers must be sequential.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n\n```\n\n**Nested numbered lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 3 or 4 spaces.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Main step\n   1. Sub-step 1\n   2. Sub-step 2\n2. Next main step\n\n```\n\n### Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation for nested mixed lists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Numbered item\n   - Bullet sub-item 1\n   - Bullet sub-item 2\n2. Next numbered item\n\n```\n\n### Common Issues to Avoid\n\n* **Inconsistent indentation:**\n\n  * All items at the same level must have identical indentation.\n* **Missing blank lines:**\n\n  * Always insert a blank line before starting a list.\n* **Line breaks within list items:**\n\n  * Indent continuation lines to align with parent item text.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. This is a long item that\n   continues on the next line\n2. Another item\n\n```\n\n* **Broken nesting:**\n\n  * Avoid mixing indentation levels/styles within lists.\n* **Special characters in lists:**\n\n  * Escape special characters at the start of list items with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- \\*Special item\\*\n\n```\n\n## Final Note\n\nPrioritize consistency by maintaining existing document style unless clear errors are identified.\n\nYour final document should be meticulously formatted, ready for immediate publishing or further use.\n\n## 1. General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why ****`-`****?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n\n\n",
