Creating a structured analysis of these barriers alongside your strategies to overcome them is a powerful way to visualize your path forward. This portfolio artifact will serve as both a reference point and a testament to your problem-solving abilities. By organizing this information in a table format, you'll create a clear roadmap that synthesizes your barrier analysis with actionable solutions.\n\n## Creating Your Barrier Analysis Table\n\nYour task is to create a comprehensive table in your portfolio that contrasts at least three barriers you've identified with the specific strategies you plan to implement to overcome them. This table will serve as a visual representation of your analytical thinking and planning skills.\n\n### Table Structure\n\nYour barrier analysis table should include the following components:\n\n1. **Barrier Column**: Clearly identify and describe each barrier that could impede your progress\n2. **Impact Column**: Briefly explain how each barrier might affect your goals if left unaddressed\n3. **Strategy Column**: Detail your specific approach to overcoming each barrier\n4. **Resources Column**: List any tools, support systems, or resources you'll need to implement your strategy\n5. **Timeline Column**: Provide a realistic timeframe for implementing your strategy\n\n### Example Format\n\nHere's a suggested format for your barrier analysis table:\n\n| Barrier | Potential Impact | Strategy | Resources Needed | Timeline |\n|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|----------|\n| Time management struggles due to work schedule | Falling behind on coursework, increased stress | Block schedule 2 hours each evening after dinner; use weekend mornings for longer assignments | Digital calendar app, Excel High School's suggested pacing guide, support from family | Implement immediately; review effectiveness after 2 weeks |\n| Difficulty understanding algebra concepts | Failing math assessments, developing negative attitude toward math | Schedule weekly tutoring sessions; use BRYTE AI Tutor for immediate help; create flashcards for formulas | Excel High School Tutoring Center, BRYTE AI Tutor, online math resources, flashcard app | Begin this week; continue for at least one month |\n| Lack of confidence in writing skills | Procrastination on essays, lower quality work | Submit drafts to Writing Lab for feedback; break essays into smaller tasks; use AI Essay Grader for initial feedback | Excel Writing Lab, AI Essay Grader, essay outlines, Success Coach Pro support | Start with next writing assignment; continue throughout semester |\n\n### Implementation Tips\n\nWhen creating your barrier analysis table:\n\n1. **Be specific**: Clearly articulate each barrier and strategy rather than using vague descriptions\n2. **Be realistic**: Ensure your strategies and timelines are achievable given your current circumstances\n3. **Be comprehensive**: Consider multiple dimensions of each barrier (psychological, practical, social, etc.)\n4. **Be solution-focused**: While acknowledging barriers is important, place greater emphasis on your strategies\n5. **Be reflective**: Consider what you've learned about yourself through the barrier identification process\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter completing your barrier analysis table:\n\n1. Review it regularly to track your progress\n2. Update strategies as you gain new insights or as circumstances change\n3. Use it as a reference when you encounter challenges\n4. Reflect on completed strategies to celebrate your growth and resilience\n\nThis portfolio artifact demonstrates your ability to not only identify obstacles but to systematically develop solutionsâ€”a valuable skill in both academic and professional settings. By creating this table, you're transforming potential roadblocks into stepping stones toward your goals.\n\nRemember that barriers are not permanent fixtures but challenges to be addressed with thoughtful planning and persistent effort. Your barrier analysis table is a living document that will evolve as you progress on your journey.\n\n## Support Resources\nNeed help creating your barrier analysis table? Remember these Excel High School resources:\n* Your assigned Success Coach\n* The Student Portal Help Center\n* BRYTE AI Tutor for real-time assistance\n* The Excel High School Student Forums where you can see examples from other students\n",
  "instructions": "# Learning Objectives Insertion Engine for Markdown Content\n\n## System Role\nYou are an expert instructional designer specialized in making surgical edits to markdown educational content. Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3. Insert these objectives in the proper location without disrupting document structure\n4. Return the complete modified markdown with your surgical insertion\n\nCritical requirements:\n- ONLY modify the document by inserting the Learning Objectives section\n- Do NOT alter any existing content in any way\n- Maintain proper paragraph breaks (one empty line between sections)\n- Ensure objectives use appropriate action verbs and are directly tied to lesson content",
