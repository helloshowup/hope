Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, and paragraph spacing. You special focus is ensuring that all bullet list are correctly formatted as per the rules. \n\n## Objective\n\nEnsure the Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\n## Context\n\n* Input: Raw Markdown text file.\n* Aim: Cosmetic formatting improvements only—no rewriting of content.\n\n## Constraints\n\n* Do **not** introduce new content or alter existing meaning.\n* Maintain existing Markdown syntax. Do not convert to HTML or other formats.\n* Prioritize readability and common Markdown conventions.\n\n## Formatting Parameters\n\n### General Document Structure Rules\n\n* Use a consistent structure.\n* Begin documents with a top-level heading (`# Heading`).\n* Maintain logical heading hierarchy (`H1 → H2 → H3`).\n* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).\n* Leave blank lines between different elements (paragraphs, code blocks, lists).\n\n### Bullet Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first bullet point\n* Use consistent symbols throughout (`-`, `*`, `+`).\n* Include a space after bullet characters.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n```\n\n**Nested bullet lists:**\n* Indent nested items with 2 or 4 spaces.\n* Maintain consistent indentation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Main item 1\n  - Sub-item 1.1\n  - Sub-item 1.2\n- Main item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n\n```\n\n**Spacing around lists:**\n\n* Leave a blank line before and after each list.\n* Do not leave blank lines between list items of the same level.\n\n### Numbered Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first numbered item\n* Start each item with a number followed by a period and a space (`1. `).\n* Numbers must be sequential.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n\n```\n\n**Nested numbered lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 3 or 4 spaces.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Main step\n   1. Sub-step 1\n   2. Sub-step 2\n2. Next main step\n\n```\n\n### Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation for nested mixed lists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Numbered item\n   - Bullet sub-item 1\n   - Bullet sub-item 2\n2. Next numbered item\n\n```\n\n### Common Issues to Avoid\n\n* **Inconsistent indentation:**\n\n  * All items at the same level must have identical indentation.\n* **Missing blank lines:**\n\n  * Always insert a blank line before starting a list.\n* **Line breaks within list items:**\n\n  * Indent continuation lines to align with parent item text.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. This is a long item that\n   continues on the next line\n2. Another item\n\n```\n\n* **Broken nesting:**\n\n  * Avoid mixing indentation levels/styles within lists.\n* **Special characters in lists:**\n\n  * Escape special characters at the start of list items with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- \\*Special item\\*\n\n```\n\n## Final Note\n\nPrioritize consistency by maintaining existing document style unless clear errors are identified.\n\nYour final document should be meticulously formatted, ready for immediate publishing or further use.\n\n## 1. General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why ****`-`****?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HND Graphic Design Learner Profile\n\n## Core Demographics\n- Second-year graphic design students (18+)\n- Varied backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers)\n- Basic design foundations from year one studies\n- Accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Preparing for professional careers in graphic design\n- Exploring specialization opportunities within the field\n- Building a professional portfolio of work samples\n- Obtaining HND certification as a professional credential\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- **Has:** Basic Higher National Certifcatre understanding of design principles, software tools, creative processes\n- **Needs:** Advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, presentation techniques\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Hands-on learners requiring digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Self-directed with strong independent research and problem-solving abilities\n- Visual learners dependent on high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Digitally connected through alternative community platforms\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context\n- Building professional confidence and industry readiness\n- Keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies\n- Developing proper digital workflow and file management practices\n- Balancing independent study with structured coursework\n- Troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Fully online accessible learning materials and assessment\n- High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs\n- Annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries\n- Optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building\n- Regular opportunities for practical application of advanced concepts\n\nThis learner ultimately seeks to emerge with specialized competencies, professional confidence, and an industry-ready portfolio that demonstrates their technical proficiency and creative capabilities.\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 05.05 Essential Technical Knowledge for Digital Asset Management\n\nThroughout your career as a graphic designer, you'll create and manage thousands of digital files. Without proper technical systems in place, these valuable assets become difficult to find, share, and use effectively. Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems provide the technical infrastructure to organise, store, and distribute these assets—a critical skill for professional designers. This lesson explores the fundamental technical concepts that enable successful digital asset management implementation, helping you maintain organised workflows, collaborate with clients, and protect your creative work.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure Requirements\n\nEffective Digital Asset Management requires robust technical infrastructure to support the demands of modern design workflows. A professional DAM system depends on scalable servers that can grow with your needs, secure storage solutions that protect valuable creative assets, and sophisticated metadata management capabilities that make finding and organizing files intuitive. Without these foundational elements, even the most organized designer will struggle to maintain efficiency as project libraries expand. The right technical infrastructure not only safeguards your work but also dramatically improves productivity by reducing the time spent searching for files and managing versions.\n\n**Storage Requirements:**\n- DAM systems need adequate storage capacity—often measured in terabytes—to accommodate large media files and their growth over time\n- For your design portfolio and client projects, plan for at least 1-2TB of dedicated storage that can expand as your work grows\n- Consider both working storage (fast, accessible) and archive storage (larger, for completed projects)\n\n**Network Considerations:**\n- DAM systems require significant bandwidth for uploading, downloading, and streaming media assets\n- Think of bandwidth like a highway: the more lanes available, the faster assets move between users and systems\n- For remote client presentations or team collaboration, make sure your internet connection supports at least 50Mbps upload speeds\n\n**System Architecture Options:**\n- **Cloud-based DAM:** Services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or specialised platforms like Bynder offer accessibility from anywhere but require reliable internet connectivity\n- **Local DAM:** Stored on your computer or external drives, providing faster access but limited sharing capabilities\n- **Hybrid solutions:** Combine local working files with cloud backup and sharing—ideal for most graphic designers\n\n### File Format Considerations\n\nFile formats play a crucial role in efficient asset management within your design workflow. Consider these important distinctions:\n\n**Image Formats:**\n- **JPEG:** Compressed format ideal for web delivery and client previews, but loses quality with each edit\n- **PNG:** Supports transparency, perfect for logos and web graphics that need to overlay other elements\n- **TIFF:** Preserves maximum quality for print projects but creates large files\n- **RAW:** Camera format that preserves all image data for maximum editing flexibility\n- **SVG/AI:** Vector formats that maintain quality at any scale, essential for logos and illustrations\n\n**Video Assets for Multimedia Projects:**\n- **MP4 (H.264):** Standard format for web delivery and client presentations\n- **ProRes/Uncompressed:** High-quality formats for editing but require substantial storage\n\n**Working vs. Delivery Formats:**\n- Maintain working files (.PSD, .AI, .INDD) with layers and editability\n- Create delivery files (.JPG, .PDF, .PNG) optimised for specific uses\n- Store both in your DAM system with clear relationships between them\n\n\n### Metadata Standards and Technical Implementation\n\nMetadata—the descriptive information about your assets—forms the technical backbone of searchability and organisation in DAM systems. For graphic designers, proper metadata implementation means never losing track of important files.\n\n**Essential Metadata for Designers:**\n- **Descriptive:** Project name, client, design type, colour profile, dimensions\n- **Administrative:** Creation date, designer name, copyright status, usage rights\n- **Technical:** File format, resolution, colour space, software version\n- **Structural:** Relationships between files (e.g., this logo is part of Brand X campaign)\n\n**Implementation Methods:**\n- **Embedded metadata:** Stored within the file itself using XMP (Adobe's Extensible Metadata Platform)\n- **Filename conventions:** Structured naming like \"ClientName_ProjectType_Version_Date\"\n- **Folder organisation:** Hierarchical structure reflecting projects, clients, and asset types\n- **Database tracking:** Using dedicated DAM software to catalogue and relate assets\n\n**Metadata in Action:**\nWithout metadata, finding the right version of a logo among hundreds of files becomes virtually impossible. Good metadata allows you to filter by client, project, colour mode (CMYK vs RGB), and version number to find what you need—saving hours of time and preventing costly mistakes.\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
