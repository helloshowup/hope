They take all the information collected by the sensors and decide what the robot should do next. Without these components, a robot would just be a collection of sensors and motors with no way to connect them!\n\n### Robot Brains: Controllers and Computers\n\nThe \"brain\" of a robot can range from very simple to extremely complex, depending on what the robot needs to do. The simplest robots use **microcontrollers** - small, specialized computers on a single chip that can run basic programs. Think of a microcontroller like a tiny computer that only knows how to do a few specific tasks, but does them very efficiently.\n\nMore advanced robots might use full computer systems similar to the ones in laptops or smartphones. These provide much more processing power, allowing the robot to handle complex tasks like recognizing faces, understanding speech, or navigating through changing environments.\n\nSome of the most advanced robots use multiple processors working together. For example, one processor might handle sensor data, another might control movement, and a third might manage communication. This is similar to how different parts of the human brain handle different functions.\n\n### Memory and Programming\n\nJust like humans need memory to remember facts and skills, robots need **memory** to store their programming and data. Most robots have two types of memory: permanent memory (like a computer's hard drive) that stores the robot's basic programming even when powered off, and temporary memory (like RAM in a computer) that holds information the robot is currently using.\n\nThe programming stored in a robot's memory tells it how to interpret sensor data and what actions to take in different situations. Simple robots might follow very basic \"if-this-then-that\" rules. For example, \"if the touch sensor is pressed, then back up and turn.\" More complex robots can run sophisticated programs that allow them to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.\n\nProgrammers create these instructions using special computer languages that the robot can understand. Common languages for programming robots include Python, C++, and specialized languages designed specifically for certain robot platforms.\n\n**CHECKPOINT:** Think about your own decision-making process when you encounter new information from your senses. How does this compare to how a robot processes input from its sensors?\n\n### Decision-Making in Robots\n\nRobots make decisions using **algorithms** - step-by-step procedures for solving problems or completing tasks. These algorithms take the information from sensors and determine what actions the robot should take.\n\nSimple robots might use straightforward \"if-then\" rules. For example, a line-following robot might use an algorithm like: \"If the sensor detects a dark line, keep going straight. If the sensor detects a light surface, turn until it finds the line again.\"\n\nMore advanced robots use complex algorithms that can weigh multiple factors at once. For instance, a delivery robot navigating a building needs to consider its current location, destination, battery level, obstacles in its path, and whether it's carrying a package - all at the same time!\n\nSome modern robots use **artificial intelligence** (AI) and **machine learning** to make decisions. Instead of following fixed rules, these robots can learn from experience and improve their performance over time. For example, a robot might learn that certain routes through a building are faster than others, or that certain objects are more fragile and need to be handled carefully.\n",
  "instructions": "# Learning Objectives Insertion Engine for Markdown Content\n\n## System Role\nYou are an expert instructional designer specialized in making surgical edits to markdown educational content. Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets.
