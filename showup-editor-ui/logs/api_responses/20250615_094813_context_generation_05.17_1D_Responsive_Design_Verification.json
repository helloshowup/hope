Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HND Graphic Design Learner Profile\n\n## Core Demographics\n- Second-year graphic design students (18+)\n- Varied backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers)\n- Basic design foundations from year one studies\n- Accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Preparing for professional careers in graphic design\n- Exploring specialization opportunities within the field\n- Building a professional portfolio of work samples\n- Obtaining HND certification as a professional credential\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- **Has:** Basic Higher National Certifcatre understanding of design principles, software tools, creative processes\n- **Needs:** Advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, presentation techniques\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Hands-on learners requiring digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Self-directed with strong independent research and problem-solving abilities\n- Visual learners dependent on high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Digitally connected through alternative community platforms\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context\n- Building professional confidence and industry readiness\n- Keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies\n- Developing proper digital workflow and file management practices\n- Balancing independent study with structured coursework\n- Troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Fully online accessible learning materials and assessment\n- High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs\n- Annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries\n- Optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building\n- Regular opportunities for practical application of advanced concepts\n\nThis learner ultimately seeks to emerge with specialized competencies, professional confidence, and an industry-ready portfolio that demonstrates their technical proficiency and creative capabilities.\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 05.17 1D Responsive Design Verification, Checklist and Cheat Sheet\n\n## Essential Verification Checklist\n\n- [ ] Design adapts appropriately to all target screen sizes\n- [ ] Breakpoints are defined and implemented correctly\n- [ ] Text remains readable at all viewport sizes\n- [ ] Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44×44px)\n- [ ] Images scale proportionally\n- [ ] Critical content remains visible in all viewport sizes\n- [ ] Navigation is accessible across all devices\n- [ ] Load times are optimized for mobile connections\n- [ ] Hover states have mobile equivalents\n- [ ] Orientation changes (portrait/landscape) are handled gracefully\n\n## Responsive Design Testing Matrix\n\n| Device/Viewport | Key Check Area | Verification Point | Check (Yes/No/N/A) | Notes/Action Required |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| **Mobile** | **Content Reflow** | Text reflows without horizontal scrolling at 320 CSS pixels | | |\n| (320px-767px) | | Forms, images, tables, and UI components reflow correctly | | |\n| | **Images** | Images scale correctly without distortion or overflow | | |\n| | **Navigation** | Hamburger/collapsed menus are functional and legible | | |\n| | **Interactive Elements** | Buttons/links are sufficiently large for touch targets | | |\n| | | Forms are easy to fill out;
