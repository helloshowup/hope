This requires adapting your static design thinking to accommodate temporal considerations.\n\n**Visual System Planning for Motion:**\nBegin by developing a comprehensive visual language that anticipates movement. Consider how your key design elements—typography, colour palette, graphic elements, and imagery—will behave when animated:\n\n- **Typography:** Choose fonts that maintain legibility when scaled, rotated or partially revealed. Consider how weight variations might create hierarchy in motion, just as they do in static design. Variations in size and font weight establish visual hierarchy, guiding viewers through your content.\n- **Colour:** Establish how colour transitions will occur. Will elements shift between brand colours, or will colour remain constant while other properties change? Remember that color interactions create contrast and visual flow when in motion. As Josef Albers demonstrated in \"Interaction of Color,\" colors appear to change when juxtaposed in different combinations, adding depth and dimension to your compositions.\n- **Composition:** Design with negative space that accommodates movement. Create layouts that can expand, contract, or reconfigure while maintaining visual balance and visual hierarchy. Simple geometric shapes often work well in motion design—circles communicate wholeness, triangles create energy and direction, while squares convey stability.\n- **Hierarchy:** Plan how priority information will be emphasised through motion. Important elements might appear first, move more distinctly, or remain stable while secondary elements animate around them. This is essential for information graphics and data visualization where communicating efficiently with viewers is paramount.\n\n**Professional Approach:** Leading design studios develop \"motion bibles\" for clients to maintain consistency across different applications and platforms. Your guide can include static keyframes showing critical states of your animations alongside timing specifications and transition rules, similar to traditional brand style guides but with temporal considerations. Like brand identity guidelines, these documents ensure visual consistency while accommodating the temporal dimension.\n\n### Building a Cohesive Motion Language\n\nOnce your visual foundation is established, develop a systematic approach to movement that gives your project a distinct personality while maintaining usability. \n\n**Motion Behaviour System:**\nProfessional motion designers categorise animations into functional types with consistent behaviours:\n\n1. **Transitions:** How elements enter, exit, or change state (e.g., consistent directional flows for scene changes)\n2. **Emphasis animations:** Techniques for highlighting important information (e.g., scale changes, colour shifts)\n3. **Informational animations:** Methods for explaining concepts or relationships (e.g., sequential reveals, cause-and-effect movements)\n4. **Interface animations:** Feedback mechanisms that respond to user interaction (e.g., button states, scrolling behaviours)\n\nFor each category, define specific motion attributes:\n- **Timing and duration:** Fast movements create energy; slower movements suggest importance\n- **Easing curves:** How elements accelerate and decelerate (avoid linear movement for more natural motion)\n- **Spatial relationships:** How elements maintain connections while moving\n- **Transformation properties:** Rules for how scale, rotation, and position changes occur\n\n**Industry Workflow:** Create an animation library or system of presets that can be reused across your project. This approach—used by professional studios like ManvsMachine and Buck—maintains consistency while improving production efficiency. Document your motion language with visual examples showing timing specifications and easing curves, similar to how you would document color interactions in a traditional brand guide. The resulting motion design board should demonstrate a unified visual aesthetic through consistent design choices in color palette, line quality, and overall style.\n\n### Adapting Motion Systems for Emerging Technologies\n\nThe true test of effective motion design is how well it performs across different technological contexts. What works on a traditional screen might need significant adaptation for AR/VR environments or interactive installations.\n\n**Cross-Platform Adaptation Strategies:**\n\n1. **Responsive Motion Design:**\n   Create motion variations that adjust based on platform capabilities and viewing context. Just as you'd design responsive layouts for different screen sizes, develop motion systems that scale appropriately:\n   - Simplify complex animations for mobile devices\n   - Enhance depth and dimensionality for immersive environments\n   - Adjust timing for different viewing distances and attention spans\n\n2. **Technical Considerations:**\n   Each platform has specific requirements that affect motion design implementation:\n   - **Performance optimisation:** Balance visual sophistication with technical efficiency\n   - **Interaction models:** Consider how touch, gesture, or gaze might trigger animations\n   - **Spatial awareness:** For AR/VR, animations must respect physical space and user position\n   - **File format requirements:** Different platforms support different animation technologies\n\n3. **Contextual Testing:**\n   Professional motion designers test their work in actual usage environments. This might include:\n   - Viewing mobile animations while walking\n   - Testing AR interfaces in various lighting conditions\n   - Evaluating motion legibility at different distances and angles\n\n**Case Study Application:** Consider how a brand like Nike maintains motion consistency across its website, mobile app, and retail displays. While their website might feature full-screen transitions between product categories, their mobile app simplifies these movements to improve performance while maintaining the same directional flow. In retail environments, these motion principles extend to environmental displays where timing is adjusted for viewing at a distance, yet the core motion characteristics that reinforce Nike's dynamic brand identity remain consistent across all platforms.\n\nThe key to successful cross-platform motion design is understanding that motion is another dimension of your visual language. Just as you would adapt typography, color, and composition to different contexts while maintaining brand consistency, you must develop motion systems that can flex across technologies while preserving your project's unique personality and communicative intent.\n",
  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
