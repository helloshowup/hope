They take all the information collected by the sensors and decide what the robot should do next. Without these components, a robot would just be a collection of sensors and motors with no way to connect them!\n\n### Robot Brains: Controllers and Computers\n\nThe \"brain\" of a robot can range from very simple to extremely complex, depending on what the robot needs to do. The simplest robots use **microcontrollers** - small, specialized computers on a single chip that can run basic programs. Think of a microcontroller like a tiny computer that only knows how to do a few specific tasks, but does them very efficiently.\n\nMore advanced robots might use full computer systems similar to the ones in laptops or smartphones. These provide much more processing power, allowing the robot to handle complex tasks like recognizing faces, understanding speech, or navigating through changing environments.\n\nSome of the most advanced robots use multiple processors working together. For example, one processor might handle sensor data, another might control movement, and a third might manage communication. This is similar to how different parts of the human brain handle different functions.\n\n### Memory and Programming\n\nJust like humans need memory to remember facts and skills, robots need **memory** to store their programming and data. Most robots have two types of memory: permanent memory (like a computer's hard drive) that stores the robot's basic programming even when powered off, and temporary memory (like RAM in a computer) that holds information the robot is currently using.\n\nThe programming stored in a robot's memory tells it how to interpret sensor data and what actions to take in different situations. Simple robots might follow very basic \"if-this-then-that\" rules. For example, \"if the touch sensor is pressed, then back up and turn.\" More complex robots can run sophisticated programs that allow them to learn from experience and adapt to new situations.\n\nProgrammers create these instructions using special computer languages that the robot can understand. Common languages for programming robots include Python, C++, and specialized languages designed specifically for certain robot platforms.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a focused checkpoint within the markers ---stopandreflect--- and ---stopandreflectEND---, crafting a brief moment that invites learners to pause and consider how the concept connects to their existing knowledge or experience. Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n### Decision-Making in Robots\n\nRobots make decisions using **algorithms** - step-by-step procedures for solving problems or completing tasks. These algorithms take the information from sensors and determine what actions the robot should take.\n\nSimple robots might use straightforward \"if-then\" rules. For example, a line-following robot might use an algorithm like: \"If the sensor detects a dark line, keep going straight. If the sensor detects a light surface, turn until it finds the line again.\"\n\nMore advanced robots use complex algorithms that can weigh multiple factors at once. For instance, a delivery robot navigating a building needs to consider its current location, destination, battery level, obstacles in its path, and whether it's carrying a package - all at the same time!\n\nSome modern robots use **artificial intelligence** (AI) and **machine learning** to make decisions. Instead of following fixed rules, these robots can learn from experience and improve their performance over time. For example, a robot might learn that certain routes through a building are faster than others, or that certain objects are more fragile and need to be handled carefully.\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content. Insert this section after all main content and any activities/assessments, typically at the document end.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n",
  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
