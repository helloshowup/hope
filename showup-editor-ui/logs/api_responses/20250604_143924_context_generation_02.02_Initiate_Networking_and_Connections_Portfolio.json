Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3.

Building a strong network of connections can open doors to opportunities that might otherwise remain hidden. This portfolio entry marks the beginning of your journey to develop meaningful professional relationships that will support your career goals. By documenting your networking strategies and experiences, you'll create a valuable resource that demonstrates your growth and helps you refine your approach to building professional connections.\n\n## Why Connections Matter\n\nProfessional connections provide numerous benefits that can significantly impact your career trajectory:\n\n* **Hidden Opportunities**: Approximately 70-80% of jobs are never posted publicly, instead being filled through referrals and recommendations within professional networks.\n\n* **Mentorship and Guidance**: Learning from others' experiences helps you avoid common pitfalls and accelerate your professional development.\n\n* **Multiple Perspectives**: Your network can provide different viewpoints on challenges, introducing innovative solutions you might not have considered.\n\n* **Enhanced Reputation**: As you develop relationships with respected individuals in your field, their endorsement builds your credibility and social capital.\n\n* **Exposure to New Ideas**: Connecting with professionals from diverse backgrounds sparks creativity and innovation in your own work.\n\n## My Networking Strategy: Informational Interviews\n\nAfter researching various networking approaches, I've decided to implement informational interviews as my primary networking strategy. This technique involves requesting brief meetings with professionals in my field of interest to learn about their career paths, daily responsibilities, and industry insights.\n\n### Why I Selected This Strategy\n\n1. **Low pressure**: Unlike networking events where interactions can feel rushed and superficial, informational interviews allow for meaningful one-on-one conversations.\n\n2. **Mutual benefit**: While I gain valuable insights, the person I'm interviewing experiences the satisfaction of mentoring and sharing their expertise.\n\n3. **Targeted connections**: I can specifically reach out to professionals in positions or organizations that align with my career goals.\n\n### My Implementation Plan\n\n* **Frequency**: One informational interview per month\n* **Initial contacts**: Alumni from Excel High School who work in my field of interest\n* **Preparation**: Research the professional and prepare thoughtful questions in advance\n* **Follow-up**: Send a thank-you note within 24 hours and maintain the connection through occasional updates\n\nThis strategy aligns with my personal communication style while still pushing me outside my comfort zone by initiating contact with new professionals.\n\n## Portfolio Documentation\n\nFor each informational interview, I'll document:\n* Professional's name, position, and company\n* Key insights gained from the conversation\n* Follow-up actions I've taken\n* How this connection has influenced my career planning\n\nBy maintaining this portfolio, I'll track my progress, reflect on lessons learned, and demonstrate my commitment to building meaningful professional relationships that support my long-term career success.\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\n* What aspects of networking currently feel most challenging to me?\n* What specific goals do I hope to achieve through building my professional network?\n* How will I measure the success of my networking efforts?\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
