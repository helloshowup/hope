Effective communication is a critical skill in both academic and professional settings. By documenting a specific example of your communication, you'll demonstrate your ability to interact with others and provide real evidence of your communication competencies. This portfolio entry will serve as valuable documentation for your BC_COMM mastery assessment.\n\n## Adding Your Communication Example\n\n### Step 1: Select a Meaningful Communication Example\n\nChoose a recent situation where you communicated well. This could be:\n- A group project where you coordinated with team members\n- A presentation you delivered to classmates or colleagues\n- A written communication (email, report, letter) that achieved its purpose\n- A difficult conversation you navigated with care\n- A time when you advocated for yourself or others\n\n**Pro Tip:** Select an example that demonstrates your strengths and shows growth in your communication abilities. Consider examples from school, work, or personal interactions that had meaningful outcomes.\n\n### Step 2: Document the Context (15-20% of your entry)\n\nIn your portfolio entry, begin by describing the situation:\n- When and where did this communication occur?\n- Who was involved in the communication?\n- What was the purpose or goal of the communication?\n- What challenges or considerations made this communication important?\n\n**Example:** \"In April 2023, I needed to request an extension on a major project from my instructor due to unexpected family circumstances. This required clear, professional communication while navigating a sensitive personal situation.\"\n\n### Step 3: Detail Your Actions (30-40% of your entry)\n\nExplain what you did to communicate well:\n- What communication methods did you choose and why?\n- What specific techniques or strategies did you employ?\n- How did you adapt your communication style to the situation?\n- What preparation did you undertake before communicating?\n\n**Example:** \"I drafted a formal email explaining my situation in a clear way, being honest about my circumstances while maintaining appropriate boundaries. I proposed a specific new deadline and outlined my plan to complete the work. Before sending, I reviewed my message for tone and clarity.\"\n\n### Step 4: Describe the Outcomes (20-25% of your entry)\n\nDocument the results of your communication:\n- How did others respond to your communication?\n- What was the end result or resolution?\n- What impact did your communication have on the situation?\n- How did this experience affect your relationships with those involved?\n\n**Example:** \"My instructor responded with understanding, granting the extension and expressing appreciation for my proactive approach. I completed the project by my proposed deadline with high quality work. This experience strengthened my professional relationship with my instructor.\"\n\n### Step 5: Reflect on Your Learning (20-25% of your entry)\n\nConclude your entry with reflection:\n- What communication skills did this experience demonstrate?\n- What did you learn about effective communication?\n- How might you use this learning in future situations?\n- What would you do differently next time?\n\n**Example:** \"This experience demonstrated my ability to communicate in a professional manner during difficult circumstances. I learned that being direct, honest, and solution-focused creates better outcomes than avoiding tough conversations. In the future, I'll continue to prioritize clear communication when facing obstacles.\"\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n**Length:** Your portfolio entry should be 400-600 words total.\n\n**Format:** Use clear headings for each section (Context, Actions, Outcomes, Reflection).\n\n**Evidence:** If appropriate, you may include screenshots of written communications (with personal information redacted) or brief transcripts of verbal exchanges as supporting evidence.\n\n## Grading Criteria\n\nYour portfolio entry will be evaluated on:\n- Specificity of your example\n- Clear demonstration of effective communication techniques\n- Thoughtfulness of your reflection\n- Professional presentation\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter completing your portfolio entry, review it to ensure you've included all necessary components: context, actions, outcomes, and reflection. Your entry should be detailed enough to provide clear evidence of your communication skills while remaining concise and focused. This documentation will serve as valuable evidence of your mastery of business communication competencies.\n\n**Remember:** Strong portfolio entries include specific details rather than general statements. The more concrete your example, the more it will demonstrate your communication abilities.\n\n**Need Help?** If you're struggling to identify a good communication example, reach out to your Success Coach through the Student Portal for guidance.\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
