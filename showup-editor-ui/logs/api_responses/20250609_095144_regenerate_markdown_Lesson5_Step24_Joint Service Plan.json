  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is a guide for creating a Joint Service Plan, which is a collaborative document between a student and their parent/guardian to formalize a service learning experience. The plan covers key elements such as timeline planning, resource identification, safety considerations, and reflection questions. The content provides a structured template for students and parents to work through together.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks within the Markdown document, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each instruction block:\n   - Carefully interpret the embedded request.\n   - Generate relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block with the new content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with the surrounding material.\n   - Match the existing tone, style, and technical level.\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks as needed for clean Markdown formatting.\n\nThe goal is to create a cohesive Markdown document where the generated content reads as if it was always part of the original.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including:\n- **Traditional Achievers (14-18)**: College-bound students who need clear structure for self-pacing.\n- **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)**: Learners juggling work/family who require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance.\n- **Credit Recovery Students**: Short-term, high-pressure learners who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n- **Homeschooling Families**: Seek accredited curriculum with strong guardian oversight.\n- **Middle School Learners (11-14)**: Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with guardian support.\n- **Specialized/International Students**: Demand tailored pathways for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.\n- **\"Second-Chance\" Learners**: Crave empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\nThe content should be adaptable to meet the needs of this diverse audience, with a focus on clear structure, practical relevance, engaging delivery, and supportive scaffolds.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through the LearnStage LMS/SIS, which is a 100% online, asynchronous platform. Key features include:\n- AI tools like the BRYTE AI Tutor and AI Essay Grader\n- Competency-based education with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and Student Portals with real-time progress tracking\n- Standards-aligned digital courseware with multimedia resources (no physical books)\n- Real-time performance dashboards and various support services\n\nThe content should be optimized for this online, self-paced learning environment, leveraging the available technology tools and features to enhance the learner experience.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. **Maintain Educational Integrity**: Ensure the content remains accurate, relevant, and aligned with best practices for service learning.\n2. **Address Enhancement Prompt**: Carefully interpret the embedded instructions and generate content that fulfills the requests.\n3. **Preserve Original Content Value**: Avoid drastically altering the core purpose and structure of the Joint Service Plan guide.\n4. **Adapt for Target Learners**: Tailor the language, examples, and complexity to match the diverse needs outlined in the learner profile.\n5. **Optimize for Online Delivery**: Leverage the capabilities of the LearnStage platform to enhance the learning experience.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Thoroughly review the current content and the enhancement prompt to understand the overall purpose and structure of the Joint Service Plan guide.\n2. Identify all instruction blocks within the Markdown document, even if they are embedded or lack clear formatting.\n3. For each instruction block:\n   - Carefully interpret the embedded request to determine the type of content being asked for.\n   - Generate relevant, well-written content that fulfills the instruction while maintaining the appropriate tone, style, and technical level.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block with the new content, ensuring it flows seamlessly with the surrounding material.\n   - Incorporate formatting adjustments (e.g., spacing, line breaks) as needed to preserve clean Markdown structure.\n4. Throughout the enhancement process, keep the target learner profile and the limitations of the online, asynchronous learning medium in mind. Adapt the content accordingly to optimize the learning experience.\n5. Review the enhanced content as a whole to ensure it reads cohesively, preserves the original intent, and addresses the key considerations outlined in this preparatory context.",
