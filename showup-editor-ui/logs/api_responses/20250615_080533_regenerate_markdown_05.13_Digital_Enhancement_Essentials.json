By implementing a structured approach to file management and applying your technical knowledge of resolution and colour spaces, you'll create a seamless bridge between capturing great images and delivering them across various media platforms.\n\n## Essential Post-Processing Workflow\n\nA systematic approach to post-processing maintains consistent quality:\n\n1. **File management**: Create a structured folder system (Original, Working, Final) to organise your assets\n2. **Delete undesirable images**: Remove duplicates, out-of-focus, or poorly exposed shots to save storage space\n3. **Rename keeper files**: Use descriptive naming conventions (e.g., ClientName_YourInitials_Number) to prevent file conflicts\n4. **Add metadata and tags**: Include IPTC metadata for searchability, ownership, and copyright information\n5. **Image adjustments**:\n   - Crop first to establish final composition\n   - Set white balance using a reference card\n   - Make exposure, contrast, and colour adjustments\n   - Apply any necessary enhancements for the intended output\n6. **Create output-specific versions**: Prepare files optimised for different media\n7. **Backup**: Always maintain multiple backups of your work on separate storage devices\n\nThis structured workflow provides the foundation for professional image management, but the quality of your final output depends on understanding technical specifications for different media. Now let's explore how resolution and file format choices impact the effectiveness of your design work across various platforms.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Resolution and File Format Optimization\n\nNow that you've established a solid workflow foundation, it's time to focus on the technical aspects that determine image quality. Understanding resolution requirements and selecting appropriate file formats are vital skills that impact how your designs appear across different media. These technical decisions help your creative work maintain its intended visual impact whether viewed on screen or in print.\n\n**Resolution optimization** is the process of adjusting pixel density to match your intended output medium:\n- **Print materials**: Higher resolutions (300 DPI or above)\n- **Web content**: Lower resolutions (72-96 DPI) to balance quality with loading speed\n\n**Think of it like**: Packing for a trip—you need enough items to be prepared, but overpacking creates unnecessary burden. Just as excessive resolution wastes resources without improving visible quality, insufficient resolution results in poor image quality.\n\n**Practical Application**: When preparing a photograph for both a printed brochure and a website:\n1. Maintain a high-resolution original file (300+ DPI) for print production\n2. Create an optimised version (72 DPI) for web use\n3. This helps maintain appropriate quality for each medium while keeping file sizes efficient\n\n**File format selection** is important for different applications:\n- **JPEG**: Best for photographs with adjustable compression; widely used in digital cameras and web content\n- **PNG**: Ideal for graphics requiring transparency\n- **TIFF**: Preferred for print-ready files requiring maximum quality\n- **RAW**: Contains unprocessed camera data, allowing adjustments to parameters like white balance, saturation, and sharpening after capture\n\nEach format offers different optimization options that should align with your colour management strategy. The choice between formats depends on your output needs and workflow requirements.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Colour Space Conversion Optimization\n\nWhile resolution and file format decisions establish the technical foundation for your images, colour accuracy across different media presents another critical challenge. Understanding colour space conversion helps your designs maintain visual integrity whether viewed on screens or in print, preventing the disappointment of colours that look vibrant on screen but appear flat in physical media.\n\n**Colour space conversion optimization** involves accurate translation between different colour models (RGB, CMYK, LAB) while preserving the intended appearance.\n\n**Think of it like**: Translation between languages—literal word-for-word translation often loses nuance, just as direct colour space conversion can lose visual impact. Proper optimization preserves the \"meaning\" of colours across different spaces.\n\n**Practical Application**: When converting a vibrant digital photograph from RGB (screen display) to CMYK (print):\n1. Colours that appear brilliant on screen may appear dull in print without proper optimization\n2. Use **perceptual rendering intent** for photographs to preserve visual relationships between colours\n3. Use **relative colorimetric intent** for logos and branding elements to maintain absolute colour accuracy\n4. Consider **selective gamut mapping** to preserve critical colours while allowing less important areas to shift as needed\n\n**White Balance Considerations**: \nAccurate white balance is essential, especially for product photography where colour fidelity is critical. Using a gray card in your first shot provides a reference point for making precise white balance adjustments during post-processing. For clients concerned with exact colour reproduction (like clothing designers), monitor calibration is equally important to help what you see match what you get.\n\n## Core Concept 3: Output-Specific Optimization Methods\n\nWith a solid understanding of resolution requirements and colour space management, the final step is tailoring your images for specific output destinations. Each medium has unique technical requirements and limitations that demand specialised approaches. Learning these output-specific techniques helps your designs maintain their impact regardless of how they're delivered to your audience.\n\nDifferent output destinations require specialised optimization approaches:\n\n**Print optimization**:\n- Ink coverage considerations\n- Dot gain compensation\n- Paper stock profiles\n- Higher resolution (300+ DPI)\n- TIFF or high-quality JPEG formats\n\n**Web optimization**:\n- Colour-safe palettes\n- Compression ratios\n- Cross-browser compatibility\n- Lower resolution (72-96 DPI)\n- JPEG or PNG formats depending on content type\n\n**Video output**:\n- Broadcast standards\n- Compression artifacts management\n- Frame rate and resolution requirements\n\n**Think of it like**: Tailoring the same basic outfit for different occasions—the core elements remain, but adjustments make it appropriate for specific contexts.\n\n**Practical Application**: When preparing a corporate presentation for both projection and printed handouts:\n1. For projection: Enhance contrast and saturation to compensate for ambient light\n2. For print: Adjust for the specific printer profile and paper stock\n3. Create output-specific versions with adjusted gamma values, contrast levels, and saturation settings\n4. This creates consistent appearance across both media\n\n",
  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
