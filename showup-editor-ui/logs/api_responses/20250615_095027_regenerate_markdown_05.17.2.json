  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an educational resource focused on color profile verification and management for graphic design professionals. It covers key topics such as monitor calibration, RGB to CMYK color conversion, color evaluation standards, implementation tools, practical exercises, device-specific calibration, and soft proofing techniques. The content is structured in a modular format with clear section headings and step-by-step instructions.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe key objective for this enhancement is to ensure the content adheres to British English spelling conventions. This includes making precise, surgical edits to correct any non-British spellings without altering the original structure, formatting, or content of the material.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with varied backgrounds. They have a basic understanding of design principles and software tools, but need to develop advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, and presentation techniques.\n\nThese learners are hands-on, self-directed, and visually oriented. They require digital alternatives to practical exercises and rely on high-quality demonstrations and examples. They are digitally connected and seek to bridge theory and practice in a professional context, build confidence and industry readiness, and develop proper digital workflow and file management practices.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through a combination of limited in-person and online platforms, with a focus on fully online accessible learning materials and assessment. The enhancement should maintain the current modular structure and formatting to ensure seamless integration with the existing digital learning environment.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content.\n- Ensure the content remains accessible, engaging, and relevant for the target learner profile.\n- Preserve the original structure, formatting, and layout of the material.\n- Make only the necessary spelling corrections to align with British English conventions.\n- Avoid any unnecessary rewrites or changes beyond the specified spelling adjustments.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content to identify all instances of non-British spellings that need to be corrected.\n2. Make precise, surgical edits to convert the identified spellings to their British English equivalents, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n3. Ensure that all technical terms with standard spellings are preserved, and that the overall formatting, layout, and punctuation remain unchanged.\n4. Verify that the content maintains its educational integrity, clarity, and relevance for the target learner profile after the spelling corrections.\n5. Conduct a final review to ensure the enhanced content adheres to the specified requirements and is ready for delivery to the learners.",
