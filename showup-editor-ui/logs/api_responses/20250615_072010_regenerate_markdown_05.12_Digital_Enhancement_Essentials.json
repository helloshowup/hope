These fundamental adjustments form the foundation of any post-processing workflow and typically include:\n\n**Exposure Correction**: Adjusting the overall brightness of an image to ensure proper visibility of details. This is similar to adjusting the volume on a stereo—finding the right balance where everything can be properly \"heard\" without being too loud or too quiet. \n\n> **PRACTICAL APPLICATION**: Open the provided underexposed landscape image in Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom. Use the Exposure slider to increase brightness while monitoring the histogram to prevent highlight clipping. Notice how details emerge in shadow areas.\n\n**Contrast Enhancement**: Increasing the difference between light and dark areas to add depth and dimension. Think of contrast as the difference between whispering and shouting in a conversation—greater contrast creates more dramatic visual impact. \n\n> **INDUSTRY TIP**: In professional workflows, the Curves adjustment tool offers more precise contrast control than basic sliders. Try creating an S-curve by slightly raising highlights and lowering shadows to add dimension to flat portraits.\n\n**White Balance Adjustment**: Correcting color temperature to ensure whites appear truly white, not yellowish or bluish. This is comparable to tuning an instrument—ensuring the \"notes\" (colors) are playing in the correct key. \n\n### Over to you\n\nHow might these fundamental adjustments relate to the color theory principles you've already studied? Consider how exposure, contrast, and white balance might affect the perception of your design's color palette.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Selective Adjustments and Masking\n\nBeyond global adjustments, professional post-processing relies on selective techniques that target specific areas of an image:\n\n**Layer Masking**: Using digital masks to apply adjustments to specific portions of an image while protecting others. This is like using painter's tape when painting a room—protecting areas you don't want to change. \n\n> **WORKFLOW DEMONSTRATION**: Follow along with the video tutorial showing how to create a layer mask in Photoshop to brighten a subject's face while maintaining proper exposure in the background. Download the practice file from the course resources.\n\n**Dodging and Burning**: Selectively lightening (dodging) or darkening (burning) specific areas to direct viewer attention and add dimension. This technique is analogous to a spotlight operator in theater, highlighting key actors while leaving others in relative shadow. \n\n> **PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT**: Review how commercial photographers use dodging and burning to emphasize product features in advertising. Try the technique on your own product photography by creating new 50% gray layers set to Overlay blending mode.\n\n**Local Contrast Enhancement**: Increasing contrast in specific areas to add texture and detail. Think of this as adding spices to specific parts of a dish rather than the entire meal. \n\n### Over to you\n\nHow might these selective adjustment techniques enhance your ability to guide viewer attention in your graphic design projects? Think about how masking and targeted enhancements could be applied to emphasize key elements in your compositions.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Finishing Techniques\n\nThe final stage of post-processing involves techniques that polish the image and prepare it for its intended output:\n\n**Sharpening**: Enhancing edge definition to increase perceived detail and clarity. This is similar to focusing binoculars—the image was already there, but proper sharpening makes it clearer and more defined. \n\n> **OUTPUT CONSIDERATIONS**: Different output mediums require different sharpening approaches. For web display, apply higher sharpening values; for print, use more subtle sharpening at higher resolutions. Test both approaches using the provided export presets.\n\n**Noise Reduction**: Minimizing digital artifacts that appear as grainy specks, particularly in shadows or areas of uniform color. This is comparable to reducing static in an audio recording—cleaning up unwanted interference. \n\n> **TECHNICAL CHALLENGE**: Download the high-ISO sample image and experiment with noise reduction settings. Find the balance between noise removal and detail preservation, then share your results in the optional discussion forum.\n\n**Color Grading**: Applying a consistent color palette or \"look\" to create mood and style. This is like a film director choosing a color palette to evoke specific emotions. \n\n> **PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT**: Develop your signature style by creating and saving color grading presets. Apply them consistently across a series of images to create a cohesive portfolio look that potential clients will recognize as uniquely yours.\n\n### Over to you\n\nHow might these finishing techniques contribute to your professional brand identity? Consider how a consistent approach to sharpening, noise reduction, and color grading across your portfolio might create a recognizable visual signature in your work.",
