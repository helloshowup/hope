  "markdown_text": "# 9.12 Glossary \n\n## Algorithm\n**Definition:**  A set of step-by-step instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.\n**Example:**  Just like you follow a recipe to bake cookies, robots follow algorithms to navigate around obstacles.\n\n## Automation\n**Definition:**  When machines do tasks that people used to do, often making the process faster or more efficient.\n**Example:**  Self-checkout machines at grocery stores are a form of automation that lets customers scan their own items.\n\n## Bias\n**Definition:**  When a robot treats some people differently than others because of how it was programmed or what data it learned from.\n**Example:**  If a robot only recognizes certain faces because it wasn't trained with diverse pictures, that's bias.\n\n## Cloud Storage\n**Definition:**  Saving information on internet servers instead of inside the robot itself, allowing access from anywhere.\n**Example:**  When your robot vacuum sends maps of your home to the company's servers, it's using cloud storage.\n\n## Collision Detection\n**Definition:**  Technology that helps robots sense when they're about to bump into something or someone.\n**Example:**  Your robot vacuum uses collision detection to avoid crashing into furniture or falling down stairs.\n\n## Consent\n**Definition:**  Getting permission from people before collecting their information or interacting with them.\n**Example:**  A robot should ask before taking your picture or recording your voice, just like a friend would.\n\n## Data Breach\n**Definition:**  When private information collected by a robot is stolen or accidentally shared with unauthorized people.\n**Example:**  If hackers break into a company's computers and steal robot camera footage from people's homes, that's a data breach.\n\n## Data Minimization\n**Definition:**  The practice of collecting only the information a robot absolutely needs to do its job.\n**Example:**  A robot vacuum only needs to map your floors, not record conversations or take photos of people.\n\n## Emergency Stop Button\n**Definition:**  A button that immediately shuts down a robot if there's a problem or danger.\n**Example:**  If a robot arm starts moving unpredictably in science class, you can press the big red emergency stop button.\n\n## Encryption\n**Definition:**  A way to scramble information so only authorized people can read it, like a secret code.\n**Example:**  When you send a private message to a friend, encryption keeps others from reading it, just like a secret language.\n\n## Ethics\n**Definition:**  The study of right and wrong that helps us decide how robots should behave and be designed.\n**Example:**  Ethics helps us decide if a delivery robot should prioritize speed or safety when navigating crowded sidewalks.\n\n## Fail-safe\n**Definition:**  A backup system that activates when something goes wrong with a robot to prevent accidents or harm.\n**Example:**  If a robot's main computer stops working, a fail-safe might automatically shut down all moving parts.\n\n## Force-sensing Technology\n**Definition:**  Sensors that let robots feel how much pressure they're applying when touching or gripping objects.\n**Example:**  A robot with force-sensing can hold an egg without breaking it or shake your hand without squeezing too hard.\n\n## Inclusive Design\n**Definition:**  Creating robots that everyone can use regardless of their abilities, language, or background.\n**Example:**  A robot with both voice commands and buttons works for people who can see, hear, or do both.\n\n## Input\n**Definition:**  Information that robots collect from their environment through sensors, cameras, or microphones.\n**Example:**  When you speak to a voice assistant, your words are the input it uses to understand your request.\n\n## Local Storage\n**Definition:**  Saving information inside the robot itself instead of sending it to internet servers.\n**Example:**  A robot that keeps your voice commands stored only in its own memory is using local storage.\n\n## Motion Limitations\n**Definition:**  Restrictions built into robots that prevent them from moving too quickly or into unsafe areas.\n**Example:**  A classroom robot has motion limitations so it moves slowly around students and can't reach dangerous heights.\n\n## Output\n**Definition:**  Actions that robots take in the world, like moving, making sounds, or displaying information.\n**Example:**  When a robot vacuum changes direction after hitting a wall, that movement is an output.\n\n## Privacy\n**Definition:**  The right to control what personal information is collected and shared about you.\n**Example:**  A robot shouldn't record video in your bedroom without permission because that would violate your privacy.\n\n## Privacy-by-Design\n**Definition:**  Building privacy protections into robots from the beginning instead of adding them later.\n**Example:**  A robot designed with privacy in mind might have a light that shows when its camera is recording.\n\n## Processing\n**Definition:**  How robots analyze information and make decisions based on what their sensors detect.\n**Example:**  When a robot vacuum sees a stain through its camera, processing helps it decide to clean that area more thoroughly.\n\n## Purpose Limitation\n**Definition:**  Using data only for the specific reason it was collected, not for other unexpected uses.\n**Example:**  If a robot collects your voice to follow commands, it shouldn't also analyze your mood without permission.\n\n## Redundant Systems\n**Definition:**  Having backup parts or programs that take over if the main ones fail, making robots safer.\n**Example:**  Airplanes have multiple computers doing the same job so if one breaks, the others keep working.\n\n## Robot Ethics\n**Definition:**  Rules and principles for designing robots that help people and don't cause harm.\n**Example:**  Robot ethics helps designers decide if a delivery robot should prioritize speed or pedestrian safety.\n\n## Safety Certification\n**Definition:**  Official approval showing a robot has passed tests proving it's safe to use.\n**Example:**  Before a robot toy can be sold in stores, it needs safety certification to prove it won't hurt children.\n\n## Sensors\n**Definition:**  Devices that help robots detect things in their environment, like light, sound, or movement.\n**Example:**  Your phone uses a light sensor to make the screen brighter when you're outside in the sun.\n\n## Stakeholders\n**Definition:**  All the different people who might be affected by a robot, including users, bystanders, and helpers.\n**Example:**  For a school robot, stakeholders include students, teachers, janitors, and visitors who interact with it.\n\n## Three Laws of Robotics\n**Definition:**  Famous rules created by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how robots should behave safely around humans.\n**Example:**  Asimov's first law states that a robot may not harm a human or allow a human to be harmed.\n\n## Transparency\n**Definition:**  Being clear and honest about what a robot is doing, how it works, and what information it collects.\n**Example:**  A robot with good transparency has a light that turns on whenever it's recording video.\n\n## User Control\n**Definition:**  Giving people choices about how robots work and what information they collect.\n**Example:**  Good user control lets you easily turn off a robot's microphone when you want privacy.\n\n## Visual Data\n**Definition:**  Information robots collect through cameras, helping them see and navigate their environment.\n**Example:**  A robot vacuum uses visual data to create maps of your home and avoid bumping into furniture.\n",
