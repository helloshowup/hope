Format the checkpoint with bold \"CHECKPOINT:\" text followed by a thought-provoking question that encourages internal processing without requiring written responses or specific activities.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Insert a \"Key Takeaways\" section within the markers ---keytakeaways--- and ---keytakeawaysEND---, analyzing the content to extract 1-3 critical concepts presented as bullet points. Format with a \"## Key Takeaways\" heading followed by 1-3 concise bullet points using single hyphens. Each takeaway should be 1-2 sentences in active voice, capturing essential concepts, distinctions, or applications that represent at least 80% of the critical content. Insert this section after all main content and any activities/assessments, typically at the document end.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n",
  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## 1. Content Summary\nThe current content explores the engineering challenge of balancing requirements and constraints in design, specifically using a scenario involving tray-carrying robot design. The material demonstrates how technical requirements can conflict with practical limitations, presenting strategies for resolving these tensions.\n\n## 2. Enhancement Requirements\n- Insert a reflective checkpoint that encourages learner engagement\n- Create a \"Key Takeaways\" section summarizing critical concepts\n- Ensure content remains accessible to 11-14 year old learners\n- Maintain the original exploration of requirements vs. constraints\n\n## 3. Target Learner Considerations\n- Simplify technical language\n- Use concrete, relatable examples\n- Break complex concepts into digestible chunks\n- Avoid abstract theoretical discussions\n- Connect concepts to middle school problem-solving experiences\n- Use active, encouraging language\n\n## 4. Learning Medium Considerations\n- Designed for asynchronous online learning\n- No peer interaction\n- Must be self-explanatory\n- Requires clear, standalone explanations\n- Visual breaks and structured content essential\n- No dependent external resources\n\n## 5. Key Considerations to Preserve\n- Core concept of requirements vs. constraints\n- Problem-solving approach\n- Practical engineering decision-making strategies\n- Innovative thinking framework\n\n## 6. Suggested Approach\n- Reframe technical language into middle school vernacular\n- Add concrete, age-appropriate examples\n- Use storytelling to illustrate engineering challenges\n- Create visual metaphors for abstract concepts\n- Maintain a conversational, encouraging tone\n- Ensure each section has clear learning objectives\n\n### Specific Enhancement Guidance\n- Checkpoint: Create a reflective moment that connects to students' problem-solving experiences\n- Key Takeaways: Distill complex ideas into 2-3 clear, actionable insights\n- Maintain 5th-6th grade reading level\n- Use active voice and direct instructions\n- Include potential visual aids or diagrams to support understanding\n\n### Language Transformation Example\n**Original:** \"When these clash, you face impossible choices.\"\n**Enhanced:** \"When requirements and limits don't match, you'll need to get creative and find smart solutions.\"\n\nThe enhancement should transform the content into an engaging, accessible exploration of engineering problem-solving that speaks directly to middle school learners' experiences and cognitive capabilities.",
