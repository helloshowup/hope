This isn't about starting over—it's about refining what you've already built. The best engineers know that great designs rarely happen on the first try. Instead, they evolve through a series of thoughtful adjustments based on real-world testing. Let's explore how to make your robot better through careful iteration.\n\n<br/>\nNow that we've identified problems through testing, let's look at how to make improvements in a systematic way.\n\n### Making Targeted Improvements\n\nWhen you make targeted improvements, you change specific parts of your design based on test results, rather than starting from scratch. It's more like precise surgery than demolishing and rebuilding a house!\n\n<br/>\nStart by connecting each problem directly to a specific improvement. For example:\n\n- If tests show your robot is too slow, you might upgrade motors or reduce weight\n- If battery life is too short, you might add a larger battery or optimize power usage in your code\n- If sensors are giving inconsistent readings, you might reposition them or add shielding from interference\n\nMake one change at a time whenever possible. This approach helps you identify which change fixed (or didn't fix) each problem. If you change five things at once and the robot improves, you won't know which change made the difference!\n\n<br/>\nKeep your original design goals in mind when making improvements. Sometimes fixing one problem might create trade-offs with other aspects of performance. For example, adding a bigger battery might improve run time but also make your robot heavier and slower.\n\n### Prioritizing Changes\n\nNot all improvements have equal importance or ease of implementation. Prioritizing helps you focus your time and resources.\n\n<br/>\nA helpful tool is the impact/effort matrix - a simple chart with four sections:\n\n1. High impact, low effort: Do these first! (Quick wins)\n2. High impact, high effort: Plan these with care (Major projects)\n3. Low impact, low effort: Do if you have time (Easy fixes)\n4. Low impact, high effort: Avoid these (Not worth it)\n\n<br/>\nFor example, if your garden-monitoring robot keeps getting stuck in mud:\n\n- High impact, low effort: Adding wider wheels (quick win)\n- High impact, high effort: Redesigning the entire movement system (major project)\n- Low impact, low effort: Making the robot more colorful (easy but not helpful)\n- Low impact, high effort: Building a new robot from scratch (not worth it)\n\nAlso consider dependencies between changes. Some improvements might need to happen in a specific order. For example, you might need to strengthen your robot's structure before adding heavier components.\n\n<br/>\nFocus on fixing critical flaws before making optional enhancements. If your robot can't complete its basic task, making it look cooler or adding extra features should wait until the core functionality works.\n\n### Documenting Design Evolution\n\nTracking how your design changes over time provides valuable insights. Create a design log that records:\n- What version of the design you're working on (v1, v2, etc.)\n- What specific changes you made in each version\n- Why you made those changes (which problems they address)\n- How the changes affected performance (with test results)\n- Any unexpected consequences of the changes\n\nInclude photos or diagrams of each version if possible. This visual record makes it easier to see how your design has evolved and might help you identify patterns or issues.\n\n<br/>\nGood documentation also helps if you need to \"roll back\" to a previous version because a change didn't work as expected. Instead of trying to remember how things were before, you'll have clear records to guide you.\n\n## Verification and Validation\n\nWhen your robot project nears completion, take time to evaluate whether your creation meets its intended purpose. This final phase goes beyond checking requirements—it ensures your robot works in real-world conditions. Let's explore how to confirm that your robot meets technical specifications and performs well in its intended environment.\n\n<br/>\nThis section covers methods for confirming that the improved design meets requirements and performs as expected in realistic conditions.\n\n### Confirming Requirements Are Met\n\nVerification is the process of checking that your robot meets all the specific requirements you established at the beginning of your project. Consider it a checklist to ensure nothing has been forgotten.\n\n<br/>\nStart by reviewing your original design requirements. For each requirement, create a specific test that will verify whether it's been met. For example:\n- If a requirement was \"robot must be able to navigate around obstacles,\" your verification test might involve placing objects in the robot's path and confirming it avoids them.\n- If a requirement was \"robot must operate for at least 30 minutes on a single charge,\" your verification would involve timing a complete run cycle.\n\nCreate a simple verification table with columns for each requirement, the test method, and whether it passed or failed. This gives you a clear picture of which requirements have been satisfied and which still need work.\n\n<br/>\nRemember that verification is objective - a requirement is either met or it isn't. This helps you make clear decisions about whether your robot is ready for real-world use.\n\n### Validating Real-World Performance\n\nValidation goes beyond checking specific requirements to evaluate how well your robot performs its intended function in realistic conditions. While verification asks \"Did we build the robot right?\", validation asks \"Did we build the right robot?\"\n\n<br/>\nTo validate your robot, test it in environments that match where it will be used. For example:\n- If you've built a line-following robot for a competition, practice on courses similar to the competition track\n- If you've built a robot to help around the house, test it in rooms with real furniture and obstacles\n\nValidation often reveals unexpected challenges that didn't show up in controlled testing. Maybe your robot works well on smooth surfaces but struggles on carpet, or performs well in bright light but gets confused in shadows.\n\n<br/>\nCollect feedback from potential users if possible. If others will be operating your robot, have them try it out and share their experiences. Their perspective might uncover usability problems you hadn't considered.\n\n### Final Design Documentation\n\nThorough documentation of your final design serves multiple purposes: it helps others understand your work, allows you to recreate your robot if needed, and provides a foundation for future improvements.\n\n<br/>\nYour final documentation should include:\n\n<br/>\n1. Design overview: A high-level description of what your robot does and how it works\n2. Detailed specifications: Dimensions, weight, materials, components used\n3. Assembly instructions: Step-by-step guide with diagrams or photos\n4. Code documentation: Code with explanations of key functions\n5. Performance data: Results from your final tests showing how the robot performs\n6. Design history: Brief summary of major changes made during development\n7. Known limitations: Honest assessment of any remaining issues or constraints\n8. Future improvements: Ideas for how the design could be enhanced further\n\n<br/>\nMake your documentation clear enough that someone with similar skills could understand and recreate your robot. Use simple language, include plenty of visuals, and organize information logically.\n\n<br/>\nRemember that good documentation is valuable even after your project is complete - it might help you or others build on your work in the future!\n\n---stopandreflect---\n**CHECKPOINT:** How did your understanding of the problem change through the testing and improvement process? Consider how your perception of what makes an effective solution evolved based on empirical evidence rather than initial assumptions.\n---stopandreflectEND---\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n- Design iteration involves making targeted improvements to specific parts of your robot based on test results, prioritizing changes using the impact/effort matrix, and documenting each version of your design.\n- Verification confirms your robot meets all technical requirements through specific tests, while validation evaluates how well it performs its intended function in realistic conditions.\n- Thorough documentation of your final design helps others understand your work, allows you to recreate your robot if needed, and provides a foundation for future improvements.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Markdown Formatting Prompt\n\nYou are a meticulous Markdown Editor specializing in refining documents for readability and adherence to best practices. Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, and paragraph spacing.\n\n## Objective\n\nEnsure the Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\n## Context\n\n* Input: Raw Markdown text file.\n* Aim: Cosmetic formatting improvements only—no rewriting of content.\n\n## Constraints\n\n* Do **not** introduce new content or alter existing meaning.\n* Maintain existing Markdown syntax. Do not convert to HTML or other formats.\n* Prioritize readability and common Markdown conventions.\n\n## Formatting Parameters\n\n### General Document Structure Rules\n\n* Use a consistent structure.\n* Begin documents with a top-level heading (`# Heading`).\n* Maintain logical heading hierarchy (`H1 → H2 → H3`).\n* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).\n* Leave blank lines between different elements (paragraphs, code blocks, lists).\n\n### Bullet Lists Rules\n\n* Use consistent symbols throughout (`-`, `*`, `+`).\n* Include a space after bullet characters.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n```\n\n**Nested bullet lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 2 or 4 spaces.\n* Maintain consistent indentation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Main item 1\n  - Sub-item 1.1\n  - Sub-item 1.2\n- Main item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n\n```\n\n**Spacing around lists:**\n\n* Leave a blank line before and after each list.\n* Do not leave blank lines between list items of the same level.\n\n### Numbered Lists Rules\n\n* Start each item with a number followed by a period and a space (`1. `).\n* Numbers must be sequential.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n\n```\n\n**Nested numbered lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 3 or 4 spaces.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Main step\n   1. Sub-step 1\n   2. Sub-step 2\n2. Next main step\n\n```\n\n### Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation for nested mixed lists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Numbered item\n   - Bullet sub-item 1\n   - Bullet sub-item 2\n2. Next numbered item\n\n```\n\n### Common Issues to Avoid\n\n* **Inconsistent indentation:**\n\n  * All items at the same level must have identical indentation.\n* **Missing blank lines:**\n\n  * Always insert a blank line before starting a list.\n* **Line breaks within list items:**\n\n  * Indent continuation lines to align with parent item text.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. This is a long item that\n   continues on the next line\n2. Another item\n\n```\n\n* **Broken nesting:**\n\n  * Avoid mixing indentation levels/styles within lists.\n* **Special characters in lists:**\n\n  * Escape special characters at the start of list items with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- \\*Special item\\*\n\n```\n\n## Final Note\n\nPrioritize consistency by maintaining existing document style unless clear errors are identified.\n\nYour final document should be meticulously formatted, ready for immediate publishing or further use.\n\n## 1. General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why ****`-`****?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n",
