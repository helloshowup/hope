By studying how others have built effective professional networks, you'll discover specific strategies behind their achievements. In this paired activity, you'll work together to analyze a networking success story and extract actionable tips for your own networking journey. This teamwork will help you spot patterns that make networking genuine and productive.\n\n## Activity Instructions: Story Dissection\n\n### Step 1: Select a Success Story\nWith your partner, you'll be analyzing the following networking success story:\n\n> **Maya's Connection Journey**\n> \n> Maya, a graphic design student, was interested in working for a creative agency but had no industry contacts.

She noticed one agency's creative director frequently posted about industry challenges.\n> \n> Maya crafted a thoughtful response to one of his posts, sharing her perspective and a small portfolio piece addressing the issue he mentioned. The director appreciated her initiative and invited her to a virtual coffee chat. During their conversation, Maya asked specific questions about the agency's creative process instead of asking for a job right away.\n> \n> The director was impressed by her genuine interest and introduced her to the hiring manager. Three months later, when a junior position opened, Maya was the first person they contacted. She was hired not just because of her skills, but because she had already demonstrated her thoughtful approach and cultural fit through her networking approach.\n\n### Step 2: Collaborative Analysis (15-20 minutes)\nWith your partner, examine this story to identify three specific, actionable networking tips. Consider:\n1. What specific actions did Maya take that led to her success?\n2. How did she approach the relationship-building process?\n3. What made her networking approach effective?\n4. What strategies could be replicated by others?\n\n**Tip:** Take notes as you discuss. Look for concrete actions in the story that produced positive results.\n\n### Step 3: Extract Three Actionable Tips\nBased on your analysis, formulate three clear, specific tips that someone could put into practice in their own networking efforts. Each tip should:\nBased on your analysis, formulate three clear, specific tips that someone could put into practice in their own networking efforts. Each tip should:\n- Explain how to implement it\n\n### Step 4: Document Your Findings\nRecord your three tips in a shared document or notes. Be prepared to share these with the class. For each tip, include:\n- A clear title for the tip\nRecord your three tips in a shared document or notes. Be prepared to share these with the class. For each tip, include:\n- How someone could use this tip in their own networking\n\n### Example of an Extracted Tip:\n> **Tip: Research Before Reaching Out**\n> \n> Maya didn't contact companies at random; she researched specific agencies and followed their social media to understand their work and values before making contact. This demonstrates the importance of targeted, informed outreach rather than generic networking. You can use this approach by identifying 3-5 specific organizations in your field and spending time learning about their recent projects before making any contact.\n\n## Partner Discussion Prompts\n\nWhile working together, consider these questions to guide your analysis:\n\nWhile working together, consider these questions to guide your analysis:\n4. How did Maya turn online connection into meaningful relationship?\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n- Complete this activity with your partner within the designated time frame (approximately 30-40 minutes total)\n- Submit your three networking tips through the assignment portal\n- Each tip should be 100-150 words in length\n- Include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) on how you plan to use at least one of these tips in your own networking efforts\n\nRemember, the goal is to extract practical, replicable strategies for your networking toolkit.
