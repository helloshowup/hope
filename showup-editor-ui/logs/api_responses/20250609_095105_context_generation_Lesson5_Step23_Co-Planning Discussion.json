Maintaining educational integrity\n2. Addressing the specific needs in the enhancement prompt\n3. Preserving the original content's core value\n4. Adapting content appropriately for the target learner profile\n5. Optimizing for the learning medium (asynchronous online, in-person classroom, etc.)\n\nYour analysis must:\n- Identify key themes and concepts in the current content\n- Extract specific requirements from the enhancement prompt\n- Determine appropriate language level, examples, and complexity based on the learner profile\n- Note any limitations or considerations based on the learning medium\n- Create a guidance framework for targeted content enhancement\n- Suggest potential improvements while preserving original intent\n\nFormat your response as a pre-fill instruction that provides a high-level overview \nincluding:\n1. Content Summary: Brief overview of the current content's purpose and structure\n2. Enhancement Requirements: Clear objectives derived from the prompt\n3. Target Learner Considerations: Specific adaptations needed for the target learner\n4. Learning Medium Considerations: Brief note on any limitations imposed by the delivery medium\n5. Key Considerations: Important elements to preserve or improve\n6. Suggested Approach: Strategic recommendations for enhancement\n\nThis preparatory context will be used as guidance for subsequent content enhancement.\nFocus on providing clear, actionable direction rather than specific edits.\nInclude everything relevant from the learner profile directly in this context - the profile information\nwill not be sent separately during enhancement.\n\n<ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n## Enhancement Prompt\nYou are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# **EXCEL HIGH SCHOOL LEARNER PROFILE — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n### **Learner Segments**\n\n* **Traditional Achievers (14–18)** – College‑bound; want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self‑pacing.\n\n* **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)** – Juggle work/family; require extreme flexibility, confidence‑building, and practical relevance.\n\n* **Credit Recovery Students** – Short‑term, high‑pressure; benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n\n* **Homeschooling Families** – Seek accredited curriculum; parents act as co‑learners via the Parent Portal.\n\n* **Middle School Learners (11–14)** – Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n\n* **Specialized/International Students** – Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.; demand tailored pathways.\n\n* **“Second‑Chance” Learners** – Cross‑segment group; crave empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\n### **Platform Features (LearnStage LMS/SIS)**\n\n* 100 % online, asynchronous course delivery.\n\n* **AI tools:** BRYTE AI Tutor (real‑time help) & AI Essay Grader (instant formative feedback).\n\n* **Competency‑Based Education certified** – Mastery gating with multiple‑attempt assessments.\n\n* **Parent & Student Portals** with real‑time progress plus automated email/SMS “Dynamic Communications.”\n\n* Standards‑aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks & video (no physical books).\n\n* Real‑time performance dashboards; Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, chatbot support.\n\n### **Key Instructional Design Drivers**\n\n1. **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** multiple means of representation, action/expression, and engagement.\n\n2. **Scaffold & Spiral:** Bloom crawl inside lessons; revisit competencies later at higher rigor.\n\n3. **Mastery‑Led Feedback:** AI \\+ human rubric loops; clear formative → summative pathway.\n\n4. **Self‑Direction Aids:** time‑management nudges, study‑skills checkpoints, orientation refreshers.\n\n5. **Flexibility WITH Structure:** suggested pacing, clear navigation, early‑win tasks.\n\n6. **Community & Presence:** instructor announcements, parent check‑ins, optional peer forums.\n\n7. **Real‑World Choice:** project‑based STEM tasks, choice menus, and micro‑credential badges.\n\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# Inviting Guardian Input on Project Scope\n\n## Introduction\nCollaborating with your guardian on your academic projects can provide valuable perspective and strengthen your support system. This guide will help you effectively invite your guardian to comment on your project scope through the Excel High School portal. By involving your guardian in this early planning stage, you'll gain additional insights that can help shape your project direction and potentially identify areas you hadn't considered.\n\n## Why Guardian Collaboration Matters\nGuardian involvement in your educational journey creates a stronger support network and helps bridge the gap between home and school. When you invite your guardian to review your project scope, you're not only keeping them informed about your academic work but also leveraging their life experience and perspective. Their input might help you identify potential challenges, refine your focus, or even expand your thinking in new directions.\n\n## Steps to Invite Guardian Comment\n**Prepare Your Project Scope**\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add one or two linking paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Don't pretend to be human. Remember this is supposed to be read.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%\n\n   Before inviting your guardian's input, make sure your project scope is clearly articulated. Include the project objectives, key questions you're exploring, resources you plan to use, and your timeline. The more clearly you can explain your project, the more meaningful feedback you'll receive.\n**Access the Guardian Communication Feature**\n\n%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add one or two linking paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing.
