Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, and paragraph spacing. You special focus is ensuring that all bullet list are correctly formatted as per the rules. \n\n## Objective\n\nEnsure the Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\n## Context\n\n* Input: Raw Markdown text file.\n* Aim: Cosmetic formatting improvements only—no rewriting of content.\n\n## Constraints\n\n* Do **not** introduce new content or alter existing meaning.\n* Maintain existing Markdown syntax. Do not convert to HTML or other formats.\n* Prioritize readability and common Markdown conventions.\n\n## Formatting Parameters\n\n### General Document Structure Rules\n\n* Use a consistent structure.\n* Begin documents with a top-level heading (`# Heading`).\n* Maintain logical heading hierarchy (`H1 → H2 → H3`).\n* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).\n* Leave blank lines between different elements (paragraphs, code blocks, lists).\n\n### Bullet Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first bullet point\n* Use consistent symbols throughout (`-`, `*`, `+`).\n* Include a space after bullet characters.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n```\n\n**Nested bullet lists:**\n* Indent nested items with 2 or 4 spaces.\n* Maintain consistent indentation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Main item 1\n  - Sub-item 1.1\n  - Sub-item 1.2\n- Main item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n\n```\n\n**Spacing around lists:**\n\n* Leave a blank line before and after each list.\n* Do not leave blank lines between list items of the same level.\n\n### Numbered Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first numbered item\n* Start each item with a number followed by a period and a space (`1. `).\n* Numbers must be sequential.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n\n```\n\n**Nested numbered lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 3 or 4 spaces.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Main step\n   1. Sub-step 1\n   2. Sub-step 2\n2. Next main step\n\n```\n\n### Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation for nested mixed lists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Numbered item\n   - Bullet sub-item 1\n   - Bullet sub-item 2\n2. Next numbered item\n\n```\n\n### Common Issues to Avoid\n\n* **Inconsistent indentation:**\n\n  * All items at the same level must have identical indentation.\n* **Missing blank lines:**\n\n  * Always insert a blank line before starting a list.\n* **Line breaks within list items:**\n\n  * Indent continuation lines to align with parent item text.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. This is a long item that\n   continues on the next line\n2. Another item\n\n```\n\n* **Broken nesting:**\n\n  * Avoid mixing indentation levels/styles within lists.\n* **Special characters in lists:**\n\n  * Escape special characters at the start of list items with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- \\*Special item\\*\n\n```\n\n## Final Note\n\nPrioritize consistency by maintaining existing document style unless clear errors are identified.\n\nYour final document should be meticulously formatted, ready for immediate publishing or further use.\n\n## 1. General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why ****`-`****?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HND Graphic Design Learner Profile\n\n## Core Demographics\n- Second-year graphic design students (18+)\n- Varied backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers)\n- Basic design foundations from year one studies\n- Accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Preparing for professional careers in graphic design\n- Exploring specialization opportunities within the field\n- Building a professional portfolio of work samples\n- Obtaining HND certification as a professional credential\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- **Has:** Basic Higher National Certifcatre understanding of design principles, software tools, creative processes\n- **Needs:** Advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, presentation techniques\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Hands-on learners requiring digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Self-directed with strong independent research and problem-solving abilities\n- Visual learners dependent on high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Digitally connected through alternative community platforms\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context\n- Building professional confidence and industry readiness\n- Keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies\n- Developing proper digital workflow and file management practices\n- Balancing independent study with structured coursework\n- Troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Fully online accessible learning materials and assessment\n- High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs\n- Annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries\n- Optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building\n- Regular opportunities for practical application of advanced concepts\n\nThis learner ultimately seeks to emerge with specialized competencies, professional confidence, and an industry-ready portfolio that demonstrates their technical proficiency and creative capabilities.\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 05.08 Setting Up Your Design Studio\n\nEstablishing a professional design studio requires careful attention to three interconnected elements: equipment calibration, preventative maintenance, and environmental controls. These components work together like a well-oiled machine—neglect one, and the others become compromised. When monitors are properly calibrated but housed in dusty, humid environments, color accuracy deteriorates rapidly. Similarly, even the most meticulously maintained equipment will produce inconsistent results without regular calibration. By understanding how these elements reinforce each other, you'll create a workspace that not only preserves your investment in tools but also ensures consistent, professional-quality output that clients can trust. The following sections break down each concept with practical guidance for implementation in both home and professional studio settings.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Equipment Calibration and Quality Control\n\n### Why Calibration Matters\nCalibration ensures consistency across all your devices and outputs—without it, your designs may appear different to clients than you intended. Regular calibration helps you maintain professional standards and avoid costly revisions, whether working digitally or transitioning between traditional and digital mediums.\n\n### Monitor Calibration\n* **Frequency**: Monthly calibration is recommended\n* **Tools**: Hardware calibrators like X-Rite i1Display Pro or Datacolor SpyderX provide the most accurate results\n* **Budget options**: Software-only solutions are less reliable but better than no calibration\n* **Process**: Follow manufacturer instructions to adjust your display's color accuracy, brightness, and contrast\n\n### Printer Calibration\n* **Process**: Create and analyze test prints to ensure color accuracy\n* **ICC profiles**: Create and maintain device profiles for each paper type you use\n* **Tools**: Use your printer's built-in utilities or third-party solutions like ColorMunki\n\n### Traditional-Digital Calibration\n* **Color matching**: Create reference charts to match traditional media colors to digital equivalents\n* **Scanning accuracy**: Calibrate scanners to accurately capture traditional artwork\n* **Lighting**: Standardize lighting conditions for evaluating both traditional and digital work\n\n**Real-World Application**: A recent graduate landed a freelance photography job but received complaints about prints appearing darker than digital proofs. After implementing a monthly calibration schedule, client satisfaction improved dramatically as digital files matched final printed deliverables.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Preventative Maintenance Schedule\n\nPreventative maintenance helps you avoid equipment failure, missed deadlines, and unexpected expenses—critical factors when building your professional reputation.\n\n### Computer Maintenance (Monthly)\n* Clean dust from internal components using compressed air\n* Check and update firmware for graphics cards and storage devices\n* Monitor system temperatures and address cooling issues\n* Verify backup systems are functioning correctly\n\n### Input Devices (Tablets, Scanners, Cameras)\n* Clean sensor surfaces weekly with appropriate materials\n* Check for firmware updates quarterly\n* Test calibration monthly\n* Inspect cables and connections for wear\n\n### Output Devices (Printers, Plotters)\n* Perform nozzle checks and cleaning cycles weekly\n* Replace ink or toner before completely empty\n* Clean paper paths monthly\n* Check for firmware updates quarterly\n\n### Traditional Tools Maintenance\n* Clean brushes, pens, and other tools after each use\n* Properly store paints, inks, and adhesives to prevent drying\n* Sharpen cutting tools regularly\n* Organize materials to prevent cross-contamination\n\n**Pro Tip**: Create a maintenance log documenting dates, procedures, and issues for both digital and traditional equipment. This practice not only helps identify patterns in equipment performance but also demonstrates professional workflow management—a valuable skill to highlight in interviews.\n\n## Core Concept 3: Environmental Factors and Equipment Longevity\n\nThe environment of your studio significantly impacts equipment performance and lifespan. These factors are especially important when setting up a home studio or shared workspace that accommodates both digital and traditional processes.\n\n### Temperature Control\n* **Optimal range**: 68-74°F (20-23°C)\n* **Why it matters**: Excessive heat accelerates component degradation; cold can cause condensation and affect traditional materials\n* **Solutions**: Reliable thermostat; consider a dedicated space heater or cooling fan for your work area\n\n### Humidity Management\n* **Optimal range**: 40-60%\n* **Risks**: Too dry = static electricity and brittle paper; too humid = condensation and warping\n* **Solutions**: Dehumidifiers or humidifiers based on your climate\n\n### Dust Protection Strategies\n* Install air purifiers with HEPA filters\n* Use dust covers when equipment is not in use\n* Position intake vents away from carpet or fabric surfaces\n* Implement regular cleaning routines for your workspace\n* Create separate zones for dusty traditional processes (cutting, sanding) away from digital equipment\n\n### Power Quality Protection\n* Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) for all critical equipment\n* Power conditioners to prevent voltage fluctuations\n* Surge protectors with high joule ratings\n* Proper grounding for all electrical outlets\n\n### Workspace Organization\n* **Ergonomics**: Arrange both digital and traditional workspaces to minimize strain\n* **Workflow efficiency**: Position equipment and materials based on frequency of use\n* **Cross-contamination prevention**: Separate wet and dry processes\n* **Lighting**: Install adjustable lighting that can be optimized for different tasks\n\n**Real-World Application**: A small design studio in a converted apartment experienced frequent equipment failures until they discovered power fluctuations in the building's electrical system. After installing basic power conditioning equipment and UPS systems, equipment failure rates decreased significantly, and the lifespan of their graphics workstations nearly doubled—demonstrating how even budget-conscious studios can achieve professional-level equipment maintenance.\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
