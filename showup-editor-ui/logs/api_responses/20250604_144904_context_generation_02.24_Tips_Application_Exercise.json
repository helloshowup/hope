Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3. Insert these objectives in the proper location without disrupting document structure\n4. Return the complete modified markdown with your surgical insertion\n\nCritical requirements:\n- ONLY modify the document by inserting the Learning Objectives section\n- Do NOT alter any existing content in any way\n- Maintain proper paragraph breaks (one empty line between sections)\n- Ensure objectives use appropriate action verbs and are directly tied to lesson content\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# **EXCEL HIGH SCHOOL LEARNER PROFILE — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n### **Learner Segments**\n\n* **Traditional Achievers (14–18)** – College‑bound; want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self‑pacing.\n\n* **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)** – Juggle work/family; require extreme flexibility, confidence‑building, and practical relevance.\n\n* **Credit Recovery Students** – Short‑term, high‑pressure; benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n\n* **Homeschooling Families** – Seek accredited curriculum; parents act as co‑learners via the Parent Portal.\n\n* **Middle School Learners (11–14)** – Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n\n* **Specialized/International Students** – Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.; demand tailored pathways.\n\n* **“Second‑Chance” Learners** – Cross‑segment group; crave empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\n### **Platform Features (LearnStage LMS/SIS)**\n\n* 100 % online, asynchronous course delivery.\n\n* **AI tools:** BRYTE AI Tutor (real‑time help) & AI Essay Grader (instant formative feedback).\n\n* **Competency‑Based Education certified** – Mastery gating with multiple‑attempt assessments.\n\n* **Parent & Student Portals** with real‑time progress plus automated email/SMS “Dynamic Communications.”\n\n* Standards‑aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks & video (no physical books).\n\n* Real‑time performance dashboards; Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, chatbot support.\n\n### **Key Instructional Design Drivers**\n\n1. **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** multiple means of representation, action/expression, and engagement.\n\n2. **Scaffold & Spiral:** Bloom crawl inside lessons; revisit competencies later at higher rigor.\n\n3. **Mastery‑Led Feedback:** AI \\+ human rubric loops; clear formative → summative pathway.\n\n4. **Self‑Direction Aids:** time‑management nudges, study‑skills checkpoints, orientation refreshers.\n\n5. **Flexibility WITH Structure:** suggested pacing, clear navigation, early‑win tasks.\n\n6. **Community & Presence:** instructor announcements, parent check‑ins, optional peer forums.\n\n7. **Real‑World Choice:** project‑based STEM tasks, choice menus, and micro‑credential badges.\n\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 2.24 Tips Application Exercise\n\n## Introduction\nNow that you've extracted valuable communication tips from the BC_STORY framework, it's time to put them into practice. The true test of understanding comes through application. In this exercise, you'll select one of the communication tips you've identified and apply it in a real-world outreach situation. This practical application will help solidify your understanding of effective communication principles and provide tangible evidence of their impact.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy completing this exercise, you will:\n- Apply communication principles in a real-world context\n- Analyze the effectiveness of specific communication strategies\n- Develop critical reflection skills about your own communication practices\n\n## Applying Your Selected Tip\n\n### Step 1: Choose Your Tip\nReview the communication tips you extracted from the BC_STORY framework. Select one that you believe would be particularly effective in a real-world communication scenario. Choose a tip that addresses an area where you'd like to improve or that seems especially relevant to your current communication needs.\n\n### Step 2: Plan Your Outreach\nIdentify a specific person or group you need to communicate with. This could be:\n- A professional contact (colleague, supervisor, potential employer)\n- A community organization\n- A friend or family member with whom you need to discuss something important\n- A customer service representative\n- A classmate for a group project\n\nPlan how you'll incorporate your chosen tip into this communication. Consider:\n- What medium will you use? (email, phone call, in-person conversation, text message)\n- What is your specific goal for this communication?\n- How will you implement the selected tip?\n\n### Step 3: Execute Your Communication\nCarry out your planned outreach, consciously applying the selected tip. Pay attention to:\n- How it feels to intentionally apply this communication principle\n- Any adjustments you make during the interaction\n- The recipient's response\n- Whether the communication achieves your intended goal\n\n### Step 4: Document Your Experience\nAfter completing your outreach, document your experience in a brief reflection (approximately 250-300 words) that includes:\n\n1. The specific tip you selected and why you chose it\n2. A description of the communication scenario (who, what, when, how)\n3. How you applied the tip in your outreach\n4. The results of your communication\n5. Your observations about the effectiveness of the tip\n6. What you might do differently next time\n\n#### Reflection Template\nTo help organize your thoughts, you can use this template:\n\n```\nTip Applied: [Write your selected tip here]\n\nCommunication Scenario: [Describe who you communicated with and the situation]\n\nApplication: [Explain how you specifically applied the tip]\n\nResults: [Describe what happened and how the recipient(s) responded]\n\nObservations: [Analyze the effectiveness of the tip based on this experience]\n\nFuture Improvements: [Suggest how you might refine your approach next time]\n```\n\n### Example Documentation\nHere's an example of what your documentation might look like:\n\n> **Tip Applied**: \"Begin with context before diving into details\"\n> \n> **Communication Scenario**: I needed to email my team about a project deadline change.\n> \n> **Application**: Instead of starting with \"The deadline has changed to Friday,\" I began with context: \"Our client has requested additional features for the project, which affects our timeline. To accommodate these changes while maintaining quality...\"\n> \n> **Results**: All team members acknowledged the email within two hours (faster than usual). No one expressed frustration about the change, and two team members proactively offered solutions.\n> \n> **Observations**: Providing context first seemed to help team members understand the reasoning behind the change before reacting to it. This appeared to reduce potential negative reactions and fostered a problem-solving mindset.\n> \n> **Future Improvements**: Next time, I would include even more specific context about which client requests led to the change, as one team member asked for clarification on this point.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\nYour documented experience should be:\n- 250-300 words in length\n- Thoughtful and specific, with concrete details\n- Focused on both your actions and the observed results\n- Submitted through the assignment portal by the due date\n\n## Success Criteria\nYour submission will be evaluated based on:\n- Clear identification and application of a specific communication tip\n- Detailed description of the communication scenario\n- Thoughtful analysis of results and effectiveness\n- Quality of reflection on future improvements\n- Organization and clarity of writing\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to complete the exercise but to gain practical insight into how these communication principles function in real-world situations. This experience will help you develop communication skills that are valuable in academic, professional, and personal contexts.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you have questions about this assignment, please reach out to your Success Coach or use the BRYTE AI Tutor for guidance.\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
