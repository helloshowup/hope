Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3. Insert these objectives in the proper location without disrupting document structure\n4. Return the complete modified markdown with your surgical insertion\n\nCritical requirements:\n- ONLY modify the document by inserting the Learning Objectives section\n- Do NOT alter any existing content in any way\n- Maintain proper paragraph breaks (one empty line between sections)\n- Ensure objectives use appropriate action verbs and are directly tied to lesson content\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# **EXCEL HIGH SCHOOL LEARNER PROFILE — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n### **Learner Segments**\n\n* **Traditional Achievers (14–18)** – College‑bound; want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self‑pacing.\n\n* **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)** – Juggle work/family; require extreme flexibility, confidence‑building, and practical relevance.\n\n* **Credit Recovery Students** – Short‑term, high‑pressure; benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n\n* **Homeschooling Families** – Seek accredited curriculum; parents act as co‑learners via the Parent Portal.\n\n* **Middle School Learners (11–14)** – Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n\n* **Specialized/International Students** – Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.; demand tailored pathways.\n\n* **“Second‑Chance” Learners** – Cross‑segment group; crave empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\n### **Platform Features (LearnStage LMS/SIS)**\n\n* 100 % online, asynchronous course delivery.\n\n* **AI tools:** BRYTE AI Tutor (real‑time help) & AI Essay Grader (instant formative feedback).\n\n* **Competency‑Based Education certified** – Mastery gating with multiple‑attempt assessments.\n\n* **Parent & Student Portals** with real‑time progress plus automated email/SMS “Dynamic Communications.”\n\n* Standards‑aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks & video (no physical books).\n\n* Real‑time performance dashboards; Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, chatbot support.\n\n### **Key Instructional Design Drivers**\n\n1. **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** multiple means of representation, action/expression, and engagement.\n\n2. **Scaffold & Spiral:** Bloom crawl inside lessons; revisit competencies later at higher rigor.\n\n3. **Mastery‑Led Feedback:** AI \\+ human rubric loops; clear formative → summative pathway.\n\n4. **Self‑Direction Aids:** time‑management nudges, study‑skills checkpoints, orientation refreshers.\n\n5. **Flexibility WITH Structure:** suggested pacing, clear navigation, early‑win tasks.\n\n6. **Community & Presence:** instructor announcements, parent check‑ins, optional peer forums.\n\n7. **Real‑World Choice:** project‑based STEM tasks, choice menus, and micro‑credential badges.\n\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 2.16 Submit Empathy Reflection\n\nIn this assignment, you'll reflect on your understanding of empathy and how it applies to your life.
