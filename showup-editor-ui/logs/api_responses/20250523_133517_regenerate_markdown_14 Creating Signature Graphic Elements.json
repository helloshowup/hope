They serve as invisible scaffolding that maintains visual harmony across an entire icon family.

Begin by determining your base size (typically 24px, 36px, or 48px for digital applications), then establish consistent padding rules (usually 1-2px from the edge). Define uniform stroke weights and corner treatments (rounded or square) that align with your brand aesthetic.\n\nWhen building icons within your grid, start with basic geometric shapes aligned to grid intersections.

Successful pattern systems address three key scaling considerations: density adjustment (how elements spread at different scales), detail preservation (which elements remain visible), and proportion maintenance.\n\nProfessional designers employ three primary scaling methods: linear scaling (simple proportional adjustment), modular scaling (adding/removing modules based on size), and detail hierarchy scaling (where certain details appear or disappear at different scales). The industry-standard 8-8-4 rule creates assets at three scales: master size (8x), common alternates (8x), and micro applications (4x).\n```\n\n**Visual Requirements:**\n\n- **Primary Visual Element:** Multi-scale comparison diagram with annotations\n- **Visual Description:** Single pattern shown at three different scales (small, medium, large) with transparent overlays highlighting the adjustments made at each scale.

  "instructions": "You are a British English spelling specialist. Your task is to carefully check the text I'm providing and correct any non-British spellings to proper British English spellings. \n\nImportant guidelines:\n1. ONLY change American or other non-British spellings to their British equivalents\n2. DO NOT rewrite, restructure, or change any content beyond spelling corrections\n3. Pay particular attention to:\n   - '-our' instead of '-or' (colour, favour, humour, etc.)\n   - '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze' (organise, analyse, etc.)\n   - '-re' instead of '-er' (centre, litre, etc.)\n   - '-ogue' instead of '-og' (catalogue, dialogue, etc.)\n   - '-ae-'/'-oe-' instead of '-e-' (anaesthesia, oestrogen, etc.)\n   - Double 'l' in verb inflections (travelled, modelling)\n   - '-ement' instead of '-ment' (judgement)\n   - '-t' instead of '-ed' in certain verbs (burnt, learnt)\n\n4. Preserve all original formatting, layout, and punctuation\n5. Preserve all technical terms that have standard spellings\n6. Make very precise, surgical edits - touch nothing that doesn't need correction\n\nExamples of words to check and correct:\n- \"color\" → \"colour\"\n- \"analyze\" → \"analyse\"\n- \"center\" → \"centre\"\n- \"dialog\" → \"dialogue\"\n- \"anesthesia\" → \"anaesthesia\"\n- \"traveling\" → \"travelling\"\n- \"judgment\" → \"judgement\"\n- \"learned\" → \"learnt\" (when used as past tense)\n\nYour goal is to ensure the text follows British spelling conventions while making the absolute minimum number of changes necessary. The text will maintain its exact original structure and content - only the spelling should be corrected.",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content covers the fundamentals of icon grid systems, their importance in maintaining visual consistency within a brand identity, and the key considerations for implementing and scaling pattern systems effectively. The content is structured as a combination of explanatory text, visual requirements, and data visualization needs.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe primary enhancement required is to carefully review the text and correct any non-British English spellings to their proper British equivalents, as per the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt. This includes changes such as '-our' instead of '-or', '-ise'/'-yse' instead of '-ize'/'-yze', '-re' instead of '-er', and various other British spelling conventions. No other changes to the content, structure, or formatting are permitted.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners are second-year HND Graphic Design students, aged 18 and above, with a mix of backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers). They have a basic understanding of design principles and software tools from their first-year studies, but are now seeking to develop advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, and presentation techniques.\n\nThe learners are hands-on, self-directed, and visually oriented, requiring high-quality demonstrations and examples to bridge theory and practice in a professional context. They are digitally connected and accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms, so the content must be fully online accessible with features like video walkthroughs and annotated examples.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content will be delivered through asynchronous online learning platforms, with optional virtual meetups for community building. The materials must be optimized for digital consumption, with a focus on visual clarity, interactivity, and ease of access.\n\n## Key Considerations\n- Maintain the educational integrity and core value of the original content\n- Ensure the spelling corrections adhere strictly to British English conventions without any other changes\n- Preserve the original formatting, layout, and punctuation throughout the text\n- Protect all technical terms that have standard spellings, making only the necessary spelling changes\n- Make precise, surgical edits to correct the spellings while touching nothing else\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the entire text, line by line, to identify any non-British English spellings.\n2. Make the necessary changes to convert the spellings to their proper British equivalents, following the guidelines provided in the enhancement prompt.\n3. Ensure that all formatting, layout, punctuation, and technical terminology remain unchanged, with only the spelling corrections applied.\n4. Verify that the content maintains its original educational value and coherence after the spelling adjustments.\n5. Provide the enhanced content with the minimum number of changes required to align it with British English spelling conventions.",
