Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3. Insert these objectives in the proper location without disrupting document structure\n4. Return the complete modified markdown with your surgical insertion\n\nCritical requirements:\n- ONLY modify the document by inserting the Learning Objectives section\n- Do NOT alter any existing content in any way\n- Maintain proper paragraph breaks (one empty line between sections)\n- Ensure objectives use appropriate action verbs and are directly tied to lesson content\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# **EXCEL HIGH SCHOOL LEARNER PROFILE — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n### **Learner Segments**\n\n* **Traditional Achievers (14–18)** – College‑bound; want honors/AP rigor but need clear structure for self‑pacing.\n\n* **Adult Diploma Seekers (18+)** – Juggle work/family; require extreme flexibility, confidence‑building, and practical relevance.\n\n* **Credit Recovery Students** – Short‑term, high‑pressure; benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback loops.\n\n* **Homeschooling Families** – Seek accredited curriculum; parents act as co‑learners via the Parent Portal.\n\n* **Middle School Learners (11–14)** – Need highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight.\n\n* **Specialized/International Students** – Enroll for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.; demand tailored pathways.\n\n* **“Second‑Chance” Learners** – Cross‑segment group; crave empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds.\n\n### **Platform Features (LearnStage LMS/SIS)**\n\n* 100 % online, asynchronous course delivery.\n\n* **AI tools:** BRYTE AI Tutor (real‑time help) & AI Essay Grader (instant formative feedback).\n\n* **Competency‑Based Education certified** – Mastery gating with multiple‑attempt assessments.\n\n* **Parent & Student Portals** with real‑time progress plus automated email/SMS “Dynamic Communications.”\n\n* Standards‑aligned digital courseware with multimedia textbooks & video (no physical books).\n\n* Real‑time performance dashboards; Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, chatbot support.\n\n### **Key Instructional Design Drivers**\n\n1. **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** multiple means of representation, action/expression, and engagement.\n\n2. **Scaffold & Spiral:** Bloom crawl inside lessons; revisit competencies later at higher rigor.\n\n3. **Mastery‑Led Feedback:** AI \\+ human rubric loops; clear formative → summative pathway.\n\n4. **Self‑Direction Aids:** time‑management nudges, study‑skills checkpoints, orientation refreshers.\n\n5. **Flexibility WITH Structure:** suggested pacing, clear navigation, early‑win tasks.\n\n6. **Community & Presence:** instructor announcements, parent check‑ins, optional peer forums.\n\n7. **Real‑World Choice:** project‑based STEM tasks, choice menus, and micro‑credential badges.\n\n\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 2.23 Success Story Analysis: Extracting Networking Best Practices\n\n## Introduction\n\nSuccess stories aren't just inspiring—they're instructional gold mines. When we examine how others have built effective professional networks, we can identify specific strategies that led to their success. In this paired activity, you'll work together to analyze a networking success story and extract actionable tips that you can apply to your own networking efforts. This collaborative analysis will help you recognize patterns and practices that make networking more effective and authentic.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n- Identify effective networking strategies from real-world examples\n- Develop specific, actionable networking techniques you can implement immediately\n- Explain why certain networking approaches are more successful than others\n\n## Activity Instructions: Story Dissection\n\n### Step 1: Select a Success Story\nWith your partner, you'll be analyzing the following networking success story:\n\n> **Maya's Connection Journey**\n> \n> Maya, a graphic design student, was interested in working for a creative agency but had no industry contacts. Instead of sending cold applications, she identified five agencies she admired and followed their social media accounts. She noticed one agency's creative director frequently posted about industry challenges.\n> \n> Maya crafted a thoughtful response to one of his posts, sharing her perspective and a small portfolio piece addressing the issue he mentioned. The director appreciated her initiative and invited her to a virtual coffee chat. During their conversation, Maya asked specific questions about the agency's creative process rather than immediately asking for a job.\n> \n> The director was impressed by her genuine interest and introduced her to the hiring manager. Three months later, when a junior position opened, Maya was the first person they contacted. She was hired not just because of her skills, but because she had already demonstrated her thoughtful approach and cultural fit through her networking approach.\n\n### Step 2: Collaborative Analysis (15-20 minutes)\nWith your partner, carefully examine this story to identify three specific, actionable networking tips. Consider:\n\n1. What specific actions did Maya take that led to her success?\n2. How did she approach the relationship-building process?\n3. What made her networking approach effective?\n4. What strategies could be replicated by others?\n\n**Tip:** Take notes as you discuss. Look for concrete actions in the story that produced positive results.\n\n### Step 3: Extract Three Actionable Tips\nBased on your analysis, formulate three clear, specific tips that someone could immediately apply to their own networking efforts. Each tip should:\n- Be specific and actionable (not vague like \"be confident\")\n- Include the reasoning behind why it works\n- Explain how to implement it\n\n### Step 4: Document Your Findings\nRecord your three tips in a shared document or notes. Be prepared to share these with the class. For each tip, include:\n- A clear title for the tip\n- A 1-2 sentence explanation\n- A specific example from the story that demonstrates this principle\n- How someone could apply this tip in their own networking\n\n### Example of an Extracted Tip:\n> **Tip: Research Before Reaching Out**\n> \n> Maya didn't contact companies randomly; she researched specific agencies and followed their social media to understand their work and values before making contact. This demonstrates the importance of targeted, informed outreach rather than generic networking. You can apply this by identifying 3-5 specific organizations in your field and spending time learning about their recent projects before making any contact.\n\n## Partner Discussion Prompts\n\nAs you work with your partner, consider these questions to guide your analysis:\n\n1. What was the most innovative aspect of Maya's networking approach?\n2. How did Maya demonstrate value before asking for anything in return?\n3. What role did authenticity play in her networking success?\n4. How did Maya turn online connection into meaningful relationship?\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n- Complete this activity with your partner within the designated time frame (approximately 30-40 minutes total)\n- Submit your three networking tips through the assignment portal\n- Each tip should be 100-150 words in length\n- Include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) on how you plan to apply at least one of these tips to your own networking efforts\n\nRemember, the goal is to extract practical, replicable strategies that you can apply to your own networking efforts. Focus on identifying principles that transcend this specific story and could work in various professional contexts.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you have questions or need clarification, use the BRYTE AI Tutor feature or message your instructor through the Student Portal.\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
