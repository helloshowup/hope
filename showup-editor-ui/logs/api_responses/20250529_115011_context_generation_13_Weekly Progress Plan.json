Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3.

By mapping out your study schedule with clear checkpoints, you transform vague intentions into concrete actions. This planning approach doesn't just organize your time—it builds momentum through consistent progress tracking and strategic self-motivation. In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an effective weekly progress plan that incorporates both accountability checkpoints and motivational elements to keep you on track toward your academic goals at Excel High School.\n\n## Creating Your Weekly Framework\n\nThe foundation of effective progress tracking is a well-structured weekly framework. Begin by creating a template that divides your week into manageable segments. Your weekly plan should include:\n\n1. **Course-Specific Goals**: For each course, identify 2-3 specific tasks to complete that week (e.g., \"Complete Module 3 in Biology\" or \"Submit English essay draft\").\n\n2. **Time Blocks**: Designate specific days and times for working on each subject. Be realistic about your available time and energy levels throughout the week.\n\n3. **Priority Indicators**: Mark high-priority tasks that are time-sensitive or particularly important for your progress.\n\n4. **Checkpoint Moments**: Schedule specific times to review your progress (mid-week and end-of-week are recommended minimum checkpoints).\n\n5. **Flexibility Buffer**: Allow 1-2 hours of unscheduled time that can be used to catch up on unexpected challenges.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Consider your personal productivity patterns when creating your framework. Are you more focused in the morning or evening? Which days typically have fewer interruptions? Align your most challenging work with your peak productivity periods for maximum effectiveness.\n\n##  Implementing Strategic Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoints transform your plan from a simple to-do list into a dynamic progress tracking system. These scheduled moments of reflection are crucial for maintaining momentum and making necessary adjustments.\n\nEffective checkpoints should include:\n\n**Daily Mini-Reviews (5 minutes)**\n- Quick assessment of what was accomplished\n- Check-off completed items\n- Identify the next day's priorities\n\n**Mid-Week Checkpoint (15-20 minutes)**\n\n- Evaluate progress on weekly goals (What percentage is complete?)\n- Identify any emerging obstacles\n- Adjust remaining schedule if needed\n- Celebrate what's been accomplished so far\n\n**End-of-Week Review (20-30 minutes)**\n\n- Assess overall completion of weekly goals\n- Identify patterns (Which subjects are on track? Which need more attention?)\n- Transfer incomplete items to next week's plan\n- Document insights about your productivity patterns\n\n**Remember:** During each checkpoint, be honest about your progress without being judgmental. The purpose is to gather information that helps you improve your approach, not to criticize yourself for any shortfalls.\n\n## Incorporating Motivational Elements\n\nStrategic self-motivation transforms progress tracking from a mechanical exercise into a personally meaningful journey. Your weekly plan should include intentional motivational elements:\n\n**Achievement Celebrations**: Plan specific rewards for reaching milestones (e.g., \"After completing my math assignment, I'll watch one episode of my favorite show\").\n\n**Visual Progress Indicators**: Create visual representations of your progress, such as:\n- Progress bars for each course\n- Stickers or symbols for completed tasks\n- Color-coding to highlight achievements\n\n**Motivational Prompts**: Include personalized motivational statements in your weekly plan:\n- Monday: \"Starting strong sets the tone for the entire week!\"\n- Wednesday: \"I've made it halfway through the week. What's one thing I'm proud of accomplishing so far?\"\n- Friday: \"Looking back, I can see how much closer I am to my goals than I was on Monday.\"\n\n**Purpose Reminders**: Include brief notes about why each course matters to your larger goals (e.g., \"Biology: Building foundation for my nursing career\").\n\n**Quick Activity:** Take a moment to think about what genuinely motivates you. Is it small rewards, visual progress, or connecting your work to your future goals? The most effective motivational elements are personalized to what genuinely inspires YOU.\n\n## Your Turn: Application Activities\n\nNow that you've learned about creating an effective weekly progress plan, it's time to put these concepts into practice. Many students find that the hardest part isn't understanding these strategies but actually implementing them consistently. Remember that developing a new habit takes time—research suggests anywhere from 18 to 254 days for a new habit to become automatic. Don't be discouraged if your first few weekly plans aren't perfect. Each week provides a fresh opportunity to refine your approach based on what you've learned about your own study patterns and motivational triggers.\n\n1. **Create Your Framework:** Look at your current weekly schedule. Identify 2-3 specific time blocks you could designate for focused academic work at Excel High School. Consider your other commitments and when you typically feel most energetic.\n\n2. **Design Your Checkpoint System:** Which type of checkpoint system would work best with your personal habits? Would daily quick reviews or fewer, more in-depth reviews be more effective for you? Create a simple checkpoint schedule for the coming week.\n\n3. **Personalize Your Motivation:** List 3-5 specific rewards or celebrations that would genuinely motivate you to complete challenging academic tasks. These should be meaningful to you personally, not what others might suggest.\n\n---keytakeaways---\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Creating a structured weekly plan is a powerful tool for academic success, as it transforms vague intentions into concrete actions and builds momentum through consistent progress tracking and self-motivation.\n- Effective weekly progress plans should include course-specific goals, designated time blocks, priority indicators, scheduled checkpoints, and a flexibility buffer to accommodate unexpected challenges.\n- Incorporating strategic checkpoints and personalized motivational elements, such as achievement celebrations, visual progress indicators, and purpose reminders, can help learners stay on track and maintain a positive, growth-oriented mindset.\n---keytakeawaysEND---\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
