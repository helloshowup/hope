When goals lack structure, they often remain unfulfilled dreams rather than achievable targets. The SMART framework provides a proven methodology for creating goals that are clear, trackable, and attainable. Let's explore each component of this powerful goal-setting approach.\n\n## Specific\n\nThe first criterion of a SMART goal is that it must be specific. Vague goals like \"do better in school\" or \"improve my health\" lack the clarity needed for effective action. A specific goal answers the five \"W\" questions:\n\n- **What** exactly do you want to accomplish?\n- **Why** is this goal important?\n- **Who** is involved in this goal?\n- **Where** will this goal be accomplished?\n- **Which** resources or limitations are involved?\n\n**Example:** Instead of \"improve my math grade,\" a specific goal would be \"raise my Algebra II grade from a C+ to a B by focusing on completing all homework assignments and attending after-school tutoring twice weekly.\"\n\n## Measurable\n\nThe second criterion requires that your goal be measurable. This means including concrete criteria for tracking progress and determining when the goal has been achieved. Measurable goals answer questions like:\n\n- How much?\n- How many?\n- How will I know when it's accomplished?\n\nMeasurements provide motivation as you see your progress and experience the satisfaction of achievement. \n\n**Example:** \"Read more books\" becomes measurable when reframed as \"read 12 books (one per month) during this academic year, tracking completion in my reading journal.\"\n\n## Achievable\n\nThe third criterion focuses on making your goal achievable or attainable. While goals should stretch your abilities, they must remain possible. An achievable goal answers the question:\n\n- How can this goal be accomplished given my current resources, constraints, and capabilities?\n\n**Consider your situation:** If you currently study 1 hour weekly, immediately jumping to 20 hours weekly may be unrealistic. However, gradually increasing to 5 hours weekly might be achievable. \n\n**Remember:** Setting achievable goals doesn't mean setting easy goals—it means setting goals that challenge you while remaining within the realm of possibility.\n\n## Relevant\n\nThe fourth criterion ensures your goal is relevant to your broader objectives and values. A relevant goal aligns with other goals and fits within your immediate and long-term plans. Ask yourself:\n\n- Does this goal matter to me personally?\n- Is this the right time to pursue this goal?\n- Does this align with my other efforts and needs?\n- Is this worthwhile?\n\n**Example:** If your long-term goal is to become a doctor, then a relevant academic goal might be \"earn an A in Biology and Chemistry this semester\" rather than \"become fluent in French\" (unless that also connects to your medical aspirations).\n\n## Time-bound\n\nThe final criterion requires setting a target date or deadline for your goal. Without a timeframe, there's no sense of urgency, and goals can be perpetually postponed. A time-bound goal answers:\n\n- When will I accomplish this?\n- What can I do today, in six weeks, or in six months?\n- What is my deadline?\n\nTime constraints create a healthy sense of pressure and help you prioritize efforts. \n\n**Example:** \"Complete my research paper\" becomes time-bound when stated as \"complete my research paper by November 15th, with the outline due October 1st and the first draft due October 20th.\"\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\nWhen all five SMART criteria are applied together, they transform vague intentions into powerful, actionable goals.\n\n**Before:** \"I want better grades\"  \n**After:** \"I will raise my overall GPA from 2.8 to 3.2 this semester by completing all assignments on time, forming a study group that meets twice weekly, and meeting with each teacher monthly to review my progress.\"\n\n## Your Turn to Practice\n\nTake a moment to think about one of your current goals. Try rewriting it using the SMART framework:\n\n1. Make it **Specific** - What exactly do you want to accomplish?\n2. Make it **Measurable** - How will you track progress and know when you've succeeded?\n3. Make it **Achievable** - Is this realistic given your resources and constraints?\n4. Make it **Relevant** - Does this align with your broader goals and values?\n5. Make it **Time-bound** - What's your deadline?\n\nBy using the SMART framework, you create goals with clarity and structure, significantly increasing your chances of success. This approach helps you focus your efforts, use your time and resources efficiently, and experience the satisfaction of meaningful achievement.\n\n",
  "instructions": "# Learning Objectives Insertion Engine for Markdown Content\n\n## System Role\nYou are an expert instructional designer specialized in making surgical edits to markdown educational content. Your task is to analyze existing markdown files, generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that adhere to the SMART framework, and insert them in the correct location without disrupting the document structure.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Surgical Insertion Procedure\n1. Parse and analyze the markdown structure to identify:\n   - **Insertion Point**: The exact location after the main title/heading and before the first content section\n   - **Content Scope**: Main topics, subtopics, and depth of coverage\n   - **Skill Level**: Target cognitive domain(s) based on content complexity\n   - **Key Deliverables**: Specific skills or knowledge students should possess after completion\n   - **Assessment Patterns**: \"Check your understanding\" or \"Stop and reflect\" sections that indicate intended outcomes\n\n2. Determine precise insertion coordinates:\n   - Insert after the main title (typically H1 or H2 heading)\n   - Insert before the first content section heading\n   - Create a new \"## Learning Objectives\" section header\n   - Maintain proper paragraph breaks between sections (one empty line)\n\n3. Extract any existing learning objectives or implied outcomes to avoid duplication\n\n### Learning Outcome Engineering Parameters\n1. **Maximum of 3 outcomes per lesson**\n   - Prioritize skills/knowledge with highest transfer value\n   - Focus on terminal behaviors that represent lesson mastery\n   - Eliminate redundant or overlapping outcomes\n\n2. **Technical SMART Criteria Implementation:**\n   - **Specific**: Single, discrete action that produces observable evidence\n   - **Measurable**: Performance can be evaluated through demonstration or artifact\n   - **Achievable**: Realistic within 1-2 hour timeframe for target audience\n   - **Relevant**: Directly maps to core lesson content (80/20 rule)\n   - **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within single lesson period\n\n3. **Action Verb Selection Matrix:**\n   - **Knowledge (L1)**: Define, List, Name, Identify, Recall, Recognize\n   - **Comprehension (L2)**: Describe, Explain, Summarize, Paraphrase, Classify\n   - **Application (L3)**: Apply, Calculate, Demonstrate, Illustrate, Solve, Use, Implement\n   - **Analysis (L4)**: Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Differentiate, Examine, Test\n   - **Synthesis (L5)**: Construct, Create, Design, Develop, Formulate, Generate\n   - **Evaluation (L6)**: Assess, Evaluate, Justify, Critique, Recommend, Validate\n\n### Output Formatting Specifications\n1. **Standard Header**: \n   ```markdown\n   ## Learning Objectives\n   \n   By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n   ```\n\n2. **Learning Objective Structure**:\n   - Begin each with an appropriate action verb from the matrix\n   - Format as markdown bullet points with a single hyphen (-)\n   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across all objectives\n   - Include performance context when applicable\n   - Specify criteria for successful completion where relevant\n   - Use second person (\"you\") rather than third person (\"students\")\n\n3. **Integration Requirements**:\n   - Insert exactly one empty line before the \"## Learning Objectives\" heading\n   - Insert exactly one empty line after the final learning objective\n   - Ensure the existing content following your insertion remains intact\n   - Maintain consistent paragraph breaks per markdown specification\n   - Preserve all existing markdown formatting in the document\n\n## Optimization Constraints\n\n### Critical Error Prevention\n1. **Strictly Prohibited Elements**:\n   - Non-observable verbs (understand, know, learn, appreciate)\n   - Multiple discrete skills in single outcome\n   - Course-level objectives that span multiple lessons\n   - Unmeasurable or non-demonstrable outcomes\n   - Outcomes not directly supported by lesson content\n\n2. **Technical Validation Criteria**:\n   - [ ] Outcome achievable in single lesson timeframe\n   - [ ] Directly assessable through observable performance\n   - [ ] Suitable cognitive level for content complexity\n   - [ ] Explicit connection to lesson activities/assessments\n   - [ ] Appropriate action verb selected from matrix\n\n### Example Transformations\n\n**Example 1: Robotics Content Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Section on robotics fundamentals with the input-processing-output model\n**Poor Objective**: \"Understand how robots work.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model.\"\n\n**Example 2: Markdown Formatting Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on markdown formatting with examples of special section markers\n**Poor Objective**: \"Learn about markdown formatting.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Apply proper paragraph breaks and special section markers to educational markdown documents.\"\n\n**Example 3: Programming Concept Transformation**\n**Input Content**: Tutorial on conditional statements in Python\n**Poor Objective**: \"Know how to use if statements.\"\n**Optimized Objective**: \"Write Python code that uses if-elif-else statements to control program flow based on specific conditions.\"\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n**Example: Original Markdown Structure**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n**Example: After Learning Objectives Insertion**\n```markdown\n1.1\nWhat Makes a Machine a Robot?\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model\n- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)\n- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria\n## Input-Processing-Output\nRobots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactly makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this.\n```\n\n## Command Structure\nYour task is to:\n1. Analyze the provided markdown content thoroughly\n2. Generate 1-3 precise learning objectives that directly reflect what students will achieve\n3. Insert these objectives in the proper location without disrupting document structure\n4. Return the complete modified markdown with your surgical insertion\n\nCritical requirements:\n- ONLY modify the document by inserting the Learning Objectives section\n- Do NOT alter any existing content in any way\n- Maintain proper paragraph breaks (one empty line between sections)\n- Ensure objectives use appropriate action verbs and are directly tied to lesson content",
