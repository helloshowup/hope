Your primary task is to receive a Markdown file and correct minor formatting inconsistencies, focusing specifically on bulleted lists, numbered lists, headings, and paragraph spacing. You special focus is ensuring that all bullet list are correctly formatted as per the rules. \n\n## Objective\n\nEnsure the Markdown file is perfectly formatted for optimal readability and visual clarity.\n\n## Context\n\n* Input: Raw Markdown text file.\n* Aim: Cosmetic formatting improvements only—no rewriting of content.\n\n## Constraints\n\n* Do **not** introduce new content or alter existing meaning.\n* Maintain existing Markdown syntax. Do not convert to HTML or other formats.\n* Prioritize readability and common Markdown conventions.\n\n## Formatting Parameters\n\n### General Document Structure Rules\n\n* Use a consistent structure.\n* Begin documents with a top-level heading (`# Heading`).\n* Maintain logical heading hierarchy (`H1 → H2 → H3`).\n* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., do not jump from H1 to H3).\n* Leave blank lines between different elements (paragraphs, code blocks, lists).\n\n### Bullet Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first bullet point\n* Use consistent symbols throughout (`-`, `*`, `+`).\n* Include a space after bullet characters.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n```\n\n**Nested bullet lists:**\n* Indent nested items with 2 or 4 spaces.\n* Maintain consistent indentation.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- Main item 1\n  - Sub-item 1.1\n  - Sub-item 1.2\n- Main item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n\n```\n\n**Spacing around lists:**\n\n* Leave a blank line before and after each list.\n* Do not leave blank lines between list items of the same level.\n\n### Numbered Lists Rules\n* CRITICAL: Leave a blank line before the first numbered item\n* Start each item with a number followed by a period and a space (`1. `).\n* Numbers must be sequential.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item\n\n```\n\n**Nested numbered lists:**\n\n* Indent nested items with 3 or 4 spaces.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Main step\n   1. Sub-step 1\n   2. Sub-step 2\n2. Next main step\n\n```\n\n### Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation for nested mixed lists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. Numbered item\n   - Bullet sub-item 1\n   - Bullet sub-item 2\n2. Next numbered item\n\n```\n\n### Common Issues to Avoid\n\n* **Inconsistent indentation:**\n\n  * All items at the same level must have identical indentation.\n* **Missing blank lines:**\n\n  * Always insert a blank line before starting a list.\n* **Line breaks within list items:**\n\n  * Indent continuation lines to align with parent item text.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n1. This is a long item that\n   continues on the next line\n2. Another item\n\n```\n\n* **Broken nesting:**\n\n  * Avoid mixing indentation levels/styles within lists.\n* **Special characters in lists:**\n\n  * Escape special characters at the start of list items with a backslash (`\\`).\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n- \\*Special item\\*\n\n```\n\n## Final Note\n\nPrioritize consistency by maintaining existing document style unless clear errors are identified.\n\nYour final document should be meticulously formatted, ready for immediate publishing or further use.\n\n## 1. General Document Structure\n\n* **Headings**\n\n  * Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.\n  * Leave one space after each `#`.\n  * The first H1 will be extracted and displayed prominently.\n\n* **Spacing**\n\n  * Blank line before and after each element (paragraph, heading, list).\n  * **Do not** insert blank lines between items of the same list.\n\n* **Styling**\n\n  * The first H1 and any H2 titled **Learning Objectives** get styled in `#920205`.\n  * Use `**bold**` and `*italics*` for text styling.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bullet List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use `-` (hyphen) as your bullet symbol.\n  * Add one space after the dash.\n\n  *Why ****`-`****?*\n\n  * Most common in Markdown ecosystem.\n  * Visually distinct from emphasis markers.\n  * No Shift key required.\n  * Widely supported by parsers.\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Paragraph before list.\n\n  - First item\n  - Second item\n    - Nested item (2 or 4 spaces indent)\n    - Another nested item\n  - Third item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Numbered List Rules\n\n* **Start & End**\n\n  * Blank line before the list.\n  * Use sequential numbers with a period and space (`1. `, `2. `).\n\n* **Example**\n\n  ```markdown\n  Text before the list.\n\n  1. First item\n  2. Second item\n  3. Third item\n  ```\n\n* **Nested Numbers**\n\n  * Indent exactly 4 spaces.\n  * Restart numbering at each level.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Main step\n      1. Sub-step\n      2. Another sub-step\n  2. Next step\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mixed Lists\n\n* Maintain consistent indentation when mixing list types.\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. Numbered item\n     - Bullet sub-item\n     - Another bullet\n  2. Next numbered item\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls\n\n* **List Continuation**\n\n  * For multiple paragraphs in an item, indent extra paragraphs to match the item's text:\n\n  ```markdown\n  1. First item\n\n     This is a new paragraph, indented to align.\n  2. Second item\n  ```\n\n* **Line Breaks**\n\n  * End a line with two spaces to break without a new paragraph:\n\n  ```markdown\n  - This line breaks here␣␣\n    and continues properly.\n  ```\n\n* **Interrupted Lists**\n\n  * Don’t insert unindented content between items.\n  * For code blocks inside lists, indent by (list indent + 4 spaces).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Special Sections\n\n* **Stop and Reflect**\n\n  * Use `### Stop and Reflect`\n  * Or custom markers:\n\n    ```markdown\n    ---stopandreflect---\n    Content here\n    ---stopandreflectEND---\n    ```\n\n* **Key Takeaways**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ### Key Takeaways\n  - …\n  ```\n\n* **Learning Objectives**\n\n  ```markdown\n  ## Learning Objectives\n\n  Intro paragraph.\n\n  - Objective 1\n  - Objective 2\n  ```\n\n---\n\nBy following these rules, your Markdown will convert cleanly to HTML, preserving list integrity and overall structure.\n\n\n\n\n</ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT>\n\n<LEARNER_PROFILE>\n## Target Learner Profile\n# HND Graphic Design Learner Profile\n\n## Core Demographics\n- Second-year graphic design students (18+)\n- Varied backgrounds (direct from secondary education or career changers)\n- Basic design foundations from year one studies\n- Accessing content through limited in-person and online platforms\n\n## Key Motivations\n- Preparing for professional careers in graphic design\n- Exploring specialization opportunities within the field\n- Building a professional portfolio of work samples\n- Obtaining HND certification as a professional credential\n\n## Entry Skills & Development Needs\n- **Has:** Basic Higher National Certifcatre understanding of design principles, software tools, creative processes\n- **Needs:** Advanced mastery of industry-standard software, responsive design principles, digital prototyping, technical implementation, project management, client communication, presentation techniques\n\n## Learning Characteristics\n- Hands-on learners requiring digital alternatives to practical exercises\n- Self-directed with strong independent research and problem-solving abilities\n- Visual learners dependent on high-quality demonstrations and examples\n- Digitally connected through alternative community platforms\n\n## Key Challenges\n- Bridging theory and practice in a professional context\n- Building professional confidence and industry readiness\n- Keeping current with evolving design trends and technologies\n- Developing proper digital workflow and file management practices\n- Balancing independent study with structured coursework\n- Troubleshooting technical issues during remote learning\n\n## Optimal Teaching Approach\n- Fully online accessible learning materials and assessment\n- High-quality visual demonstrations and video walkthroughs\n- Annotated examples and comprehensive image galleries\n- Optional discussion callled \"Over to You\" and virtual meetups for community building\n- Regular opportunities for practical application of advanced concepts\n\nThis learner ultimately seeks to emerge with specialized competencies, professional confidence, and an industry-ready portfolio that demonstrates their technical proficiency and creative capabilities.\n</LEARNER_PROFILE>\n\n<CONTENT>\n## Current Content\n# 05.11 Capturing Perfect Digital Images\n\nThe five core concepts presented here form an interconnected system for achieving professional-quality digital images. Each element builds upon the others—a well-designed workflow provides the structure, appropriate equipment delivers the technical capability, skilled lighting reveals the subject's true character, specialized techniques overcome unique challenges, and proper digitization methods preserve artistic integrity. While this guide uses product photography as its primary example, the principles extend to all digital photography disciplines. This approach transforms what might at first appear daunting into a manageable process of decisions and actions that produce excellent results. When you understand how these concepts work together, you can develop consistent methods that work for any image capture scenario.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Designing a Structured Capture Workflow\n\nA digital capture workflow serves as a roadmap that guides you from pre-capture preparation through post-capture processing. An effective workflow begins with preparation: calibrating your equipment, setting up proper lighting, and determining the technical specifications required for your project.\n\n**For graphic design projects, this means:**\n- Identifying the required resolution (300dpi for print, 72-150dpi for digital)\n- Selecting appropriate color profiles (sRGB for digital, CMYK for print)\n- Determining optimal file formats based on usage (RAW for maximum editing flexibility, JPEG for web, TIFF for print)\n\nThink of your workflow as a production line—each station has specific quality standards and processes that must be completed before moving to the next. \n\n**Example Workflow for Product Photography:**\n1. **Pre-Capture Setup**\n   - Equipment preparation (camera, lenses, tripod)\n   - Lighting setup and testing (considering direction and quality)\n   - Background preparation\n   - Test shot evaluation\n   - White balance calibration using a gray card\n\n2. **Capture Phase**\n   - Subject positioning and styling\n   - Multiple angle/perspective captures\n   - Bracketed exposures for flexibility or HDR imaging\n   - Reference shots with color checkers\n\n3. **Review and Transfer**\n   - On-camera review of critical elements\n   - File transfer with immediate backup\n   - Initial organization into project folders\n\n4. **Post-Processing**\n   - Cropping and straightening for clean presentation\n   - Color correction to match the original subject\n   - Removing imperfections (dust, scratches, unwanted reflections)\n   - Background removal if needed for versatility\n   - File organization with proper naming conventions\n\n## Core Concept 2: Equipment Selection and Technical Considerations\n\nThe selection of appropriate equipment for product photography plays a key role in achieving professional results. While you don't need the most expensive gear on the market, certain tools are necessary for different types of product photography.\n\n**Camera Systems:**\n- DSLR or mirrorless cameras offer the most flexibility for professional product photography\n- Look for cameras with features that support your specific needs (flash control, macro capabilities)\n- Consider future needs when investing in a camera system to avoid frequent upgrades\n\n**Lens Selection:**\n- For detailed product shots, a dedicated macro lens with at least a 1:1 reproduction ratio is essential\n- Standard zoom lenses work well for larger products\n- Consider specialized lenses for specific types of photography (e.g., tilt-shift for architecture)\n\n**Essential Accessories:**\n- A sturdy tripod is non-negotiable for product photography to eliminate camera shake\n- Remote shutter release to prevent camera movement during exposure\n- Gray card and color checkers for accurate white balance and color reproduction\n\n**Technical Settings:**\n- ISO sensitivity: Lower settings (100-200) provide better image quality with less noise\n- Manual exposure gives you complete control over aperture and shutter speed\n- Consider using RAW format to preserve maximum image data for post-processing flexibility\n\n## Core Concept 3: Perfecting Lighting Techniques\n\nLighting forms the backbone of product photography. The way you light your subject determines how textures, colours, and details appear in your final image.\n\n**Lighting Direction:**\n- Overhead lighting provides a good starting point for product photography\n- Sidelighting emphasizes texture and creates more dramatic shadows\n- The position of your lights relative to both the camera and subject determines the final look\n- Small adjustments can change highlights and shadows dramatically\n\n**Lighting Quality:**\n- Diffused lighting softens shadows and reduces harsh reflections\n- Direct lighting creates stronger contrast and defined shadows\n- Consider using light modifiers like diffusion panels, reflectors, or softboxes\n- Natural light (indirect sunlight) can be excellent but may require colour temperature adjustments\n\n**Lighting for Specific Challenges:**\n- For reflective products, diffused lighting helps control unwanted reflections\n- For electronics and small details, specialized macro lighting techniques may be necessary\n- When capturing liquids in motion, flash duration is vital for freezing action\n\n**White Balance Considerations:**\n- Accurate colour reproduction is critical for products where colour is a key attribute\n- Use a gray card in your first test shot to establish correct white balance\n- Monitor calibration helps what you see match what clients will receive\n\n## Core Concept 4: Specialized Techniques for Challenging Subjects\n\nSome products present unique challenges that require specialized approaches:\n\n**For Reflective Products:**\n- Use diffusion materials to soften light sources\n- Control reflections by positioning lights and diffusers\n- Consider double diffusion techniques for reflective surfaces\n\n**For Liquid Photography:**\n- Use high shutter speeds (1/2000s) or flash with short duration to freeze motion\n- Set up proper containment for spills and overflows\n- Shoot in continuous mode to capture the perfect moment\n\n**For Electronics and Small Details:**\n- Invest in quality macro lenses with close focusing capabilities\n- Use controlled lighting to highlight tiny components without creating harsh shadows\n- Consider focus stacking for extending depth of field in extreme close-ups\n\n## Core Concept 5: Digitizing Traditional Artwork\n\nFor digitizing hand-created artwork, two primary methods are available: scanning or photography. Your choice depends on the artwork type, intended use, and available budget.\n\n**Scanning Advantages:**\n- Provides consistent lighting and distortion-free capture for flat artwork\n- Entry-level flatbed scanners ($100-$120) deliver excellent results for illustrations and drawings\n- Eliminates issues with lens distortion and inconsistent lighting\n\n**Photography Advantages:**\n- Better for textured or three-dimensional artwork\n- Offers more flexibility for larger pieces\n- Can be accomplished with existing equipment (DSLR or mirrorless camera)\n\n**Post-Processing Essentials:**\n- **Cropping and Straightening:** These fundamental first steps remove unwanted borders and align artwork for clean presentation.\n- **Colour Correction:** Critical for making digital colours match the original artwork:\n  - Adjust brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation for accurate colour fidelity\n  - Be aware that screen colours (RGB) will differ from print colours (CMYK)\n  - Run test prints to check colours aren't over or under-saturated\n  - Use tools like \"Color Range\" for selective adjustments to specific areas\n- **Removing Imperfections:** Digitization often magnifies tiny flaws:\n  - Use healing brush, clone stamp, or eraser tools to clean up dust, scratches, and smudges\n  - Consider AI-powered tools to automate tedious retouching tasks\n  - A drawing tablet can enhance precision for redrawing elements the scanner might have missed\n- **Background Removal:** Creates transparent backgrounds for versatile asset integration:\n  - Isolate the subject (artwork) from its background for seamless integration into designs\n  - AI-powered background removers can automate this process effectively\n  - For line art, make sure the background is pure white for easier removal\n  - Use layers and masks to maintain editability\n- **Vectorization:** Transforms pixel-based drawings into scalable vector graphics:\n  - Vector graphics can be scaled without quality loss\n  - Important for logos, icons, and illustrations used across multiple sizes\n  - Adobe Illustrator's Image Trace or Inkscape's Trace Bitmap are effective tools\n  - The process involves scanning line art at high DPI (300+), using trace tools, and refining paths\n\n**Software Considerations:**\n- Professional options: Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for thorough editing\n- Affordable alternatives: Affinity Photo, GIMP, or Krita for image editing\n- Vectorization tools: Adobe Illustrator's Image Trace or Inkscape's Trace Bitmap feature\n\n**File Management Best Practices:**\n- Implement consistent naming conventions for easy retrieval\n- Organize files into logical folder structures by project or asset type\n- Back up files often to avoid losing valuable work\n- Consider version control to track changes and iterations\n\nBy implementing these structured approaches to digital image capture, you'll create consistent, high-quality images that enhance your graphic design projects. Remember that developing these techniques requires practice and patience—even experienced photographers adjust their setups as they work towards the ideal shot. The time invested in developing proper capture and editing skills will enhance the professional quality of your final work.\n\nA final note: while quality equipment helps, software proficiency and editing skills are just as important for achieving professional results. Even with basic capture equipment, strong editing skills can enhance your output. Focus on developing both aspects of the digital capture process to maximize the quality of your design assets.\n\n\n\n</CONTENT>\n",
