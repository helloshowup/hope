  "instructions": "You are about to receive a Markdown document containing embedded content-generation instructions. These instructions are enclosed within the delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph, immediately follow bold text (e.g., **For Adult Learners:**), or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block:\n   - Read the embedded request carefully and interpret what content is being asked for.\n   - Generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the instruction.\n   - Replace the entire instruction block—including both delimiters—with your generated content.\n   - Ensure the new content flows smoothly with both the preceding and following material.\n   - Match the document’s existing tone, style, and technical level. **Avoid using first person.**\n   - Insert spacing or line breaks if necessary to maintain clean Markdown formatting and readability.\n\nSpecial attention:\n\n- Instruction blocks may not always be isolated or clearly separated—do not assume blank lines or perfect formatting.\n- Always check the nearby context (before and after) to guide content tone, purpose, and integration.\n- Honor any formatting or content specifications given inside the instruction block.\n- Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout.\n\nDo not edit any portion of the document outside the identified instruction blocks.\n\nThe final result should be a cohesive Markdown document in which your generated content reads as if it was always part of the original—natural, well-structured, and instruction-free.\n\n",
  "context": "# Preparatory Context for Content Enhancement\n\n## Content Summary\nThe current content is an instructional guide for an \"Impact Reflection Submission\" assignment. It outlines the requirements for students to submit an audio recording and written reflection about their community service experience. The content provides guidance on what to include in the reflections, submission guidelines, and success tips. It also highlights the importance of this assignment as a \"mastery gate\" in the course.\n\n## Enhancement Requirements\nThe enhancement prompt asks the content analyst to:\n1. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded mid-paragraph or lack surrounding line breaks.\n2. For each block, generate thoughtful, relevant content that fulfills the embedded instruction, while ensuring the new content flows smoothly and matches the existing tone, style, and technical level.\n3. Replace the entire instruction block, including the delimiters, with the generated content.\n4. Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout the document.\n\n## Target Learner Considerations\nThe target learners for this content are diverse, including:\n- Traditional Achievers (14-18): College-bound students who need clear structure for self-pacing\n- Adult Diploma Seekers (18+): Busy adults who require extreme flexibility, confidence-building, and practical relevance\n- Credit Recovery Students: Short-term, high-pressure learners who benefit from targeted modules and rapid feedback\n- Homeschooling Families: Parents acting as co-learners who seek accredited curriculum\n- Middle School Learners (11-14): Highly engaging, intuitive tasks with strong guardian oversight\n- Specialized/International Students: Tailored pathways for STEM, ELL, pilot training, etc.\n- \"Second-Chance\" Learners: Empathetic climate, small wins, and resilience scaffolds\n\nThe content should be adapted to address the needs of this diverse audience, using appropriate language, examples, and complexity levels.\n\n## Learning Medium Considerations\nThe content is designed for asynchronous online delivery through the LearnStage LMS/SIS platform. Key features include:\n- 100% online, asynchronous course delivery\n- AI tools for real-time help and instant formative feedback\n- Competency-based education with mastery gating and multiple-attempt assessments\n- Parent and student portals with real-time progress tracking and automated communications\n\nAny enhancements should consider the limitations and affordances of this online, asynchronous learning medium.\n\n## Key Considerations\n1. Maintain the educational integrity and core purpose of the \"Impact Reflection Submission\" assignment.\n2. Address the specific requirements outlined in the enhancement prompt, including identifying and enhancing all instruction blocks.\n3. Preserve the original content's value and flow, while adapting the language, examples, and complexity to suit the diverse target learner profiles.\n4. Optimize the content for the asynchronous online delivery, leveraging the platform's features and capabilities.\n\n## Suggested Approach\n1. Carefully review the current content and the enhancement prompt to fully understand the requirements and context.\n2. Identify all instruction blocks, even if they are embedded or lack clear formatting, and analyze the content needed to fulfill each one.\n3. Generate new content for each instruction block that is thoughtful, relevant, and aligned with the existing tone, style, and technical level.\n4. Integrate the new content seamlessly into the document, ensuring it flows naturally with the surrounding material.\n5. Maintain consistent terminology and audience awareness throughout the enhanced content.\n6. Consider the target learner profiles and the online, asynchronous delivery medium when crafting the new content.\n7. Review the final enhanced document to ensure it meets the key considerations and provides a cohesive, instruction-free experience for the learners.",
