If you need help, you can always contact your academic advisor through your student portal.\n</edited_content>\n\n<edit_summary>\n- Simplified the introduction to be more direct and student-friendly, removing potentially intimidating language about \"technical requirements\"\n- Adjusted the self-assessment instructions to use more conversational language that speaks directly to high school students\n- Simplified some complex sentences in the reflection section to improve readability for 14-18 year olds\n- Added a brief mention of how these skills connect to future goals (college and careers) to increase relevance and motivation\n- Removed self-referential language like \"in this module\" and maintained a straightforward, encouraging tone throughout\n</edit_summary>"}
