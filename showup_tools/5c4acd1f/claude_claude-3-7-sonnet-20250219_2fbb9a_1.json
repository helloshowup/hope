We've compiled the most frequently asked questions from prospective and current students to help you navigate your educational path with confidence. Having answers to these common questions will empower you to make informed decisions about your education while reducing wait times for personalized assistance.\n\n## Top Five Tuition & Enrollment FAQs\n\n### 1. Will colleges accept my Excel High School credits and diploma?\n\nYes! Excel High School is nationally accredited by Cognia (formerly AdvancED) and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA-CESS). Our accreditation ensures that our diplomas and transcripts are recognized by colleges, universities, employers, and the military nationwide. We maintain a database of thousands of colleges and universities that have accepted our graduates. Our regional accreditation means your diploma carries the same weight as one from a traditional brick-and-mortar school.\n\n### 2. Can I change programs after I've enrolled?\n\nAbsolutely. We understand that educational needs can change. Students can transfer between our various programs (such as Standard, Honors, or Adult Diploma) with minimal disruption to their academic progress. If you wish to change programs, simply contact your academic advisor who will guide you through the transition process. Any applicable tuition differences will be calculated based on courses completed and remaining coursework in your new program.\n\n### 3. What payment options are available for tuition?\n\nExcel High School offers several flexible payment options to accommodate various financial situations:\n- Full payment upfront (with discount)\n- Monthly payment plans through our partnership with TFC Credit Corporation\n- Quarterly payment options\n- Special military and multiple-family member discounts\n- Credit/debit card payments, bank transfers, and PayPal\n\nWe also offer tuition assistance for qualifying students and accept workplace education benefits from many employers. Our goal is to make quality education accessible through flexible financing options.\n\n### 4. How long will it take to complete my program?\n\nProgram completion time varies based on several factors:\n- The program you select (Standard, Honors, Adult)\n- How many transfer credits you bring to Excel\n- Your personal pace of study\n- Time dedicated to coursework each week\n\nMost full-time students complete a grade level in approximately 9-10 months.

Adult learners focusing exclusively on their studies can sometimes complete diploma requirements in 6-12 months. During enrollment, your academic advisor will help you create a realistic timeline based on your specific situation.\n\n### 5.
