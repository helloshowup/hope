This button is typically located in the top navigation bar or sidebar of your course pages.\n\nOnce you click the button, a chat interface will open, allowing you to interact directly with BRYTE. The interface is user-friendly, resembling a typical messaging app. You'll see a text input field at the bottom where you can type your questions or requests.\n\nKey commands to remember when using BRYTE:\n\n1.

In this example, we'll ask BRYTE to explain the quadratic formula.\n\nStudent: \"BRYTE, can you explain the quadratic formula and how to use it?\"\n\nBRYTE: \"Certainly! The quadratic formula is used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0. The formula is:\n\nx = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nHere's a breakdown of how to use it:\n1. Identify the values of a, b, and c in your equation.\n2. Plug these values into the formula.\n3. Solve the equation, which will give you two solutions (the ± indicates there are two possibilities).\n\nWould you like an example to see how this works in practice?\"\n\nStudent: \"Yes, please give me an example.\"\n\nBRYTE: \"Great! Let's solve the equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0.\n\n1. Identify a, b, and c:\n   a = 1, b = 5, c = 6\n\n2. Plug into the formula:\n   x = [-5 ± √(5² - 4(1)(6))] / (2(1))\n\n3. Solve:\n   x = [-5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2\n   x = [-5 ± √1] / 2\n   x = [-5 ± 1] / 2\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\nx = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -2\nx = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -3\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = -2 and x = -3.\n\nDo you need any clarification on this process?\"\n\nAs you can see, BRYTE breaks down complex concepts into manageable steps, making it easier to understand and apply mathematical principles.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Outlining an Essay with BRYTE (300 words)\n\nBRYTE isn't just for math; it can also assist with writing tasks. Let's see how BRYTE can help outline an essay.\n\nStudent: \"BRYTE, can you help me outline an essay on the impacts of social media?\"\n\nBRYTE: \"Absolutely!
