Be sure to provide accurate contact information, as this will be used for all future communications.\n\n**Step 2: Sign the Enrollment Agreement**\nAfter submitting your application, you'll receive an enrollment agreement via email. This document outlines the terms of your enrollment, including program details, tuition information, and school policies. Review this document carefully before signing electronically.
