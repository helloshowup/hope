As university costs climb and admission gets more competitive, understanding this option could give you a real edge in planning your future education.\n\n## What is Dual Enrolment?\n\nDual enrolment lets high school students take college courses and earn credits that count toward both high school and college requirements at the same time. It's like building a bridge between your current studies and higher education.\n\nAt Excel High School, we use a specific conversion system: **3 college credits equal 1.0 high school credit**. This means a typical one-semester college course provides you with a full high school creditâ€”equivalent to what you'd earn in a year-long high school course.\n\nTake College Composition I, for instance. Complete this 3-credit college course, and you'll receive 1.0 high school English credit while also banking those college credits for your future degree. When you finish a dual enrolment course, the credits show up on both your high school transcript and an official college transcript from our partner college.\n\n## Who is Eligible for Dual Enrolment?\n\nTo make sure students are ready for university-level work, Excel High School has set these eligibility requirements:\n\n- **Grade Level**: Typically open to students in years 10-12 (sophomore, junior, or senior status)\n- **Enrolment Status**: You must be fully enrolled at Excel High School\n- **Academic Foundation**: You need to have completed at least six Excel High School credits\n- **Academic Standing**: A GPA of 3.0 or higher is generally needed\n\n**Special Exceptions for Year 9 High-Achievers:** While dual enrolment usually starts in year 10, exceptional year 9 students who show outstanding academic abilities may be considered case by case. These students need to demonstrate readiness through strong grades, test scores, and advisor recommendations.\n\nIf you're interested, chat with your academic advisor to check if you meet the requirements and to work out how college courses might fit into your high school schedule.\n\n## Key Benefits of Dual Enrolment\n\nTaking dual enrolment courses can significantly change your educational path in several ways:\n\n**Faster Graduation:** By earning credits that count twice, you might finish your university degree in less time. Some motivated students collect enough credits to enter university as a second-year or even third-year student.\n\n**Lower University Costs:** Dual enrolment courses typically cost much less than the same courses taken after finishing high school. At Excel High School, we offer these courses at reduced rates compared to standard university tuition, potentially saving you thousands on your higher education.\n\n**Easier Transition to University:** Getting a taste of university-level expectations and workloads while still having high school support helps build the academic skills you'll need later. You'll learn to navigate university systems, communicate with professors, and handle university-level assignments with a safety net still in place.\n\n**Stronger University Applications:** Successfully completing university courses shows admissions committees you can handle higher-level work, which may improve your chances of getting into competitive programmes.\n\n## Traditional vs. Dual Enrolment Pathways\n\n| Traditional Pathway | Dual Enrolment Pathway |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Year 9-12**: Complete standard high school curriculum | **Year 9-10**: Build foundation with Excel HS courses |\n| **Year 13-16**: Complete 4-year university degree | **Year 11-12**: Take dual enrolment courses |\n| **Total Time**: 8 years (4 HS + 4 university) | **Year 13-15**: Complete remaining university requirements |\n| **Total Cost**: Full high school + full university tuition | **Total Time**: 6-7 years |\n| **University Entry**: First-year status | **Total Cost**: Reduced by 1-2 years of tuition |\n| | **University Entry**: Possible second/third-year status |\n\n## Over to You\n1.
