As an online student, you have the freedom to access your courses anytime, but it's important to understand when live support is available. This lesson explains the 24/7 platform access, office hours, and how after-hours help requests are handled. Knowing these details will help you plan your studies effectively and ensure you get support when you need it most.\n\n### Core Concept 1: 24/7/365 Platform Access\n\nAt Excel High School, you can access your courses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. This means you can log in to study, complete assignments, and take assessments whenever it works best for you.\n\nWhat does this 24/7 access mean for you?\n\n- Study early in the morning or late at night – whatever fits your schedule\n- Work on weekends or holidays if that's when you have free time\n- Access all course materials, readings, and assignments at any time\n- Submit work whenever it's ready, not just during business hours\n\nThis flexibility is perfect for:\n- Athletes with demanding practice schedules\n- Students who work part-time jobs\n- Those with family responsibilities\n- Anyone who prefers to learn at their own pace\n\nRemember, while the platform is always available, it's still important to create a consistent study schedule that works for you. The flexibility is there to help you succeed, not to create pressure to study around the clock.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Office Hours for Staff Support\n\nWhile you can access your courses anytime, our staff and teachers are available during specific hours:\n\n**Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST)**\n\nDuring these office hours, you can:\n- Get immediate responses to emails and messages\n- Receive help with technical issues\n- Ask questions about assignments\n- Schedule one-on-one support with teachers\n- Receive graded work and feedback\n\nIf you live in a different time zone, you'll need to adjust for the time difference:\n- Eastern Time: Add 1 hour (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM)\n- Mountain Time: Subtract 1 hour (7:00 AM to 4:00 PM)\n- Pacific Time: Subtract 2 hours (6:00 AM to 3:00 PM)\n\nHelpful Tip: Save your most challenging assignments for times when staff support is available. This way, if you get stuck, help is just a message away!\n\n### Core Concept 3: Help Desk Ticket System for After-Hours Support\n\nWhat happens if you need help at midnight or on the weekend? Excel High School has a system for that!\n\nOur Help Desk ticket system works like this:\n\n1. **Submit a ticket anytime** - Even outside office hours, you can always submit a help request through your student portal.\n\n2. **Automatic confirmation** - You'll receive an immediate confirmation that your ticket was received.\n\n3. **Priority sorting** - The system automatically categorizes tickets by urgency:\n   - High priority: Technical issues preventing course access\n   - Medium priority: Assignment questions with approaching deadlines\n   - Standard priority: General questions and non-urgent matters\n\n4. **Next business day response** - When office hours resume, our support team reviews all tickets in priority order and responds accordingly.\n\nFor most issues, you can expect a response within one business day. For example, if you submit a ticket on Friday night, you'll likely receive a response on Monday morning.\n\nPlanning ahead is key! If you have an assignment due Monday, try to ask questions by Friday afternoon rather than Sunday night.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your typical daily schedule. When do you think you'll most often access your Excel High School courses?\n\n2. If you live in a different time zone, what are Excel's office hours in your local time? How might this affect when you ask for help?\n\n3. Imagine you're working on an important assignment due tomorrow, but you're stuck on a concept and it's after office hours. What steps would you take to address this situation?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Excel High School's learning platform is accessible:\n   - A.
