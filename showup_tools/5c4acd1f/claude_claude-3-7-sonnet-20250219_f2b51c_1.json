As a student at Excel High School, becoming a member of these societies can be a meaningful achievement that showcases your dedication to excellence. NHS and JNHS membership isn't just an honor to add to your college applications—it's an opportunity to develop leadership skills, contribute to your community, and connect with like-minded peers who value academic achievement.\n\nLet's explore what it takes to become a member of NHS or JNHS, understand the core values these organizations promote, and walk through the application process. Whether you're in 7th grade considering Junior NHS or a high school sophomore thinking about NHS, this information will help you set goals and prepare for a successful application.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Eligibility Criteria\n\nBefore you can apply for NHS or JNHS, you need to meet certain eligibility requirements:\n\n**Academic Requirements:**\n- Minimum GPA of 3.5 (unweighted)\n- This demonstrates your commitment to academic excellence across all subjects\n\n**Grade Level Requirements:**\n- Junior NHS: Open to students in grades 7-9\n- NHS: Open to students in grades 10-12\n\nMeeting these basic criteria makes you eligible to apply, but it doesn't guarantee acceptance. The selection process considers all four pillars of NHS, not just your grades. Think of the GPA requirement as the first step in a more comprehensive evaluation of your character and contributions.\n\n**Pro Tip:** If you're currently below the 3.5 GPA threshold, don't get discouraged! Start working now to improve your grades. Even if you can't apply this year, maintaining strong academic performance will prepare you for future opportunities.\n\n### Core Concept 2: The Four Pillars of NHS\n\nNHS and JNHS evaluate candidates based on four fundamental pillars. Understanding these pillars will help you prepare a strong application:\n\n**1. Scholarship**\nThis pillar is reflected in your GPA, but it's more than just getting good grades. It's about demonstrating a genuine love for learning.\n\n*Examples of scholarship activities:*\n- Participating in academic competitions or olympiads\n- Tutoring peers in challenging subjects\n- Taking advanced or honors courses\n- Conducting independent research projects\n\n**2. Leadership**\nNHS members are expected to be positive influences and take initiative in their school and community.\n\n*Examples of leadership activities:*\n- Holding an officer position in a school club\n- Captaining a sports team\n- Organizing school events or fundraisers\n- Leading group projects in class\n- Starting a new initiative at school\n\n**3. Character**\nThis pillar focuses on your personal integrity, ethics, and how you treat others.\n\n*Examples of good character:*\n- Being honest in academic work\n- Showing respect to teachers and peers\n- Taking responsibility for your actions\n- Supporting classmates during challenges\n- Demonstrating reliability and punctuality\n\n**4. Service**\nNHS and JNHS members are committed to helping others and improving their communities.\n\n*Examples of service activities:*\n- Volunteering at local organizations\n- Participating in community clean-ups\n- Helping with school events\n- Supporting charitable causes\n- Creating care packages for those in need\n\nWhen applying, you'll need to provide specific examples of how you've demonstrated each of these pillars. Start thinking about your experiences and how they align with these values.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Application Process\n\nThe application process for NHS and JNHS at Excel High School follows these steps:\n\n**1. Expression of Interest**\nEligible students will receive an invitation to apply. You'll need to confirm your interest in being considered for membership.\n\n**2. Application Submission**\nYou'll complete an application form that includes:\n- Academic information\n- List of extracurricular activities\n- Leadership positions held\n- Service hours and activities\n- Personal statement or essay\n- Character references\n\n**3. Faculty Review**\nA committee of teachers and administrators will review all applications, considering how well you demonstrate the four pillars.\n\n**4. Service Verification**\nYou'll need to provide documentation of your community service hours. Keep records of your volunteer work, including dates, hours, and supervisor contact information.\n\n**5. Final Selection**\nThe faculty council makes the final decision on membership offers based on your complete application.\n\n**6. Induction Ceremony**\nSuccessful candidates are formally welcomed into the NHS or JNHS during a special ceremony that recognizes your achievement.\n\n**Important Note:** Excel High School students participating in the ElevatED Summit program receive additional guidance and support for their NHS applications. This includes application workshops, essay review sessions, and mentoring from current NHS members.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Take a moment to calculate your current GPA. Are you at or above the 3.5 threshold? If not, what specific classes could you focus on improving?\n\n2. Think about your current activities and achievements. Create a list categorizing them under each of the four pillars (Scholarship, Leadership, Character, and Service). Are there any pillars where you could strengthen your involvement?\n\n3.
