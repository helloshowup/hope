We've compiled the most frequently asked questions to help you navigate these important aspects of your education. Understanding these key points will empower you to make informed decisions and take control of your academic path from the beginning.\n\n## Top Five Tuition & Enrollment FAQs\n\n### 1. Will colleges accept my Excel High School credits and diploma?\n\nYes! Excel High School is nationally accredited by Cognia and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA-CESS), both recognized accrediting bodies. Our accreditation ensures that colleges, universities, employers, and the military recognize and accept our diplomas and transcripts. Excel High School graduates have been accepted to hundreds of colleges and universities nationwide. \n\nWhile most institutions readily accept our credits, we recommend contacting your specific colleges of interest to confirm their credit acceptance policies, as admission requirements can vary by institution.\n\n### 2. Can I change programs after I've enrolled?\n\nAbsolutely. We understand that educational needs can evolve over time. You can upgrade or change your program at any point during your enrollment. For example, if you want to switch from a single course to a full diploma program, or change between diploma tracks, simply contact our Student Services team.\n\nAny tuition you've already paid will be applied toward your new program, and you'll only need to pay the difference if upgrading. Program changes are typically processed within 1-2 business days, allowing you to continue your educational journey with minimal disruption.\n\n### 3. What payment options are available for tuition?\n\nExcel High School offers several flexible payment options to fit your budget:\n- Full payment: Pay the entire tuition upfront and receive a discount\n- Monthly payment plans: Spread your tuition over affordable monthly installments\n- Quarterly payment plans: Make payments every three months\n- Third-party financing: Options available through partner financial institutions\n- Discounts: Military, sibling, and financial need-based options may be available\n\nWe accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and electronic checks. There are no hidden fees, and all course materials are included in your tuition.\n\n### 4. How long will it take to complete my program?\n\nProgram completion time varies based on several factors:\n- Full diploma programs: Typically 1-2 years, depending on transfer credits and your pace\n- Individual courses: Can be completed in as little as 4-8 weeks or extended up to 12 months\n- Credit recovery: Often completed within 4-8 weeks per course\n\nExcel High School's self-paced model means you can accelerate through material you understand quickly or take more time with challenging concepts. There are no set semester dates or deadlines, allowing you to create a schedule that works for your life circumstances.\n\n### 5. What if I need to take a break from my studies?\n\nLife happens, and we understand that sometimes you need flexibility. Excel High School offers:\n- Course extensions: Add 3, 6, or 12 months to your enrollment period\n- Temporary holds: Pause your studies for up to 3-6 months due to personal circumstances, medical issues, or other significant life events\n- Re-enrollment options: If your enrollment expires, you can re-enroll and maintain your academic progress\n\nDuring a temporary hold, your account remains active, but the course completion timeline is paused. To request any of these options, simply contact Student Services before your enrollment period ends.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n[<button>Tuition Page</button>](https://www.excelhighschool.com/tuition) - View detailed program costs and payment options\n\n[<button>Help Desk</button>](https://www.excelhighschool.com/help) - Submit specific questions to our support team\n\n[<button>Payment Portal</button>](https://www.excelhighschool.com/payments) - Make payments, view payment history, and update payment methods\n\nStill have questions?
