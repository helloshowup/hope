At Excel High School, we take harassment and bullying very seriously. Understanding our policies not only protects you but also empowers you to contribute to a positive school culture. In this lesson, we'll explore the different types of harassment, learn how to report incidents, and understand the consequences of policy violations. This knowledge will help ensure that every student feels secure and valued in our school community.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Defining Key Terms\n\nHarassment and bullying can take many forms. It's important to recognize these behaviors to maintain a respectful environment:\n\n- Sexual harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\n- Racial harassment: Targeting someone based on their race, color, or national origin through verbal abuse, physical intimidation, or hostile actions.\n- Religious harassment: Mistreating or discriminating against someone because of their religious beliefs or practices.\n- Chronic harassment: Persistent, ongoing negative behavior targeted at an individual over time.\n\nThese definitions help us identify unacceptable conduct. Remember, harassment isn't just about the intent of the person doing the action, but also about how it impacts others. If behavior makes someone feel uncomfortable, intimidated, or excluded, it may be considered harassment.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Reporting an Incident\n\nIf you experience or witness harassment or bullying, it's crucial to report it promptly. Here's how:\n\n1. Document the incident: Write down what happened, when, where, and who was involved.\n2. Tell a trusted adult: Speak to a teacher, counselor, or administrator as soon as possible.\n3. File a formal report: Complete the school's incident report form, available in the main office or online portal.\n4. Provide evidence: If you have any texts, emails, or social media posts related to the incident, include them with your report.\n\nRemember, reporting an incident is not \"tattling.\" It's an important step in maintaining a safe school environment for everyone. Excel High School takes all reports seriously and treats them confidentially.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Investigation Process and Retaliation Policy\n\nOnce a report is filed, here's what happens:\n\n1. The school administration reviews the report within 24 hours.\n2. An impartial investigator is assigned to the case.\n3. The investigator interviews all parties involved and any witnesses.\n4. Evidence is collected and analyzed.\n5. A determination is made based on the investigation findings.\n6. Appropriate actions are taken, and all parties are informed of the outcome.\n\nExcel High School has a strict no-retaliation policy. This means that anyone who reports an incident or participates in an investigation is protected from any form of retaliation. Retaliation can include threats, intimidation, or any adverse action against someone for their involvement in a harassment complaint. Any acts of retaliation will be treated as serious violations of school policy and will result in disciplinary action.\n\n### Consequences for Policy Violations\n\nExcel High School employs a progressive discipline approach for harassment and bullying violations. Consequences may include:\n\n1. Verbal warning: For minor first-time offenses.\n2. Written warning: Documented in the student's file.\n3. Probation: A set period during which any further violations result in more severe consequences.\n4. Removal from specific classes or activities: To separate involved parties.\n5. Suspension: Temporary removal from school.\n6. Expulsion: Permanent removal from Excel High School.\n\nThe specific consequence depends on the severity of the incident, any prior history of misconduct, and other relevant factors. In some cases, legal authorities may also be involved if the behavior violates state or federal laws.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about a time when you witnessed or experienced disrespectful behavior. How did it make you feel, and what actions could have been taken to address the situation?\n\n2. Why do you think it's important for schools to have clear policies on harassment and bullying? How do these policies contribute to a positive learning environment?\n\n3.
