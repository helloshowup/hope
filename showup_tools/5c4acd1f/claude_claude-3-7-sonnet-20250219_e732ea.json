This guide provides you with a clear path forward and answers to common questions that may arise as you begin your coursework. By following this checklist, you'll ensure you've completed all necessary setup steps and are fully prepared to succeed in your Excel High School experience.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Tuition and Payments\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How and when do I make tuition payments?</strong></summary>\n<p>Excel High School offers several payment options to fit your needs. Full program tuition can be paid upfront for a discount, or you can choose our convenient monthly payment plan. Payments can be made through our secure online portal using credit/debit cards or electronic checks. For monthly plans, payments are automatically processed on the same day each month. To view your payment schedule or make a payment, log in to your student portal and navigate to the \"Billing\" section.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Are there any additional fees beyond tuition?</strong></summary>\n<p>Excel High School's tuition covers most aspects of your education, including instructional materials and academic support. However, there may be nominal fees for specific services such as transcript requests, expedited grading, or graduation ceremony participation. These optional services are clearly listed in your student portal. There are no hidden fees, and we pride ourselves on transparent pricing.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What happens if I miss a tuition payment?</strong></summary>\n<p>We understand that financial situations can change. If you anticipate difficulty making a payment, please contact our student services team proactively. A brief grace period is provided for late payments, after which a late fee may apply. Extended non-payment may result in temporary suspension of access to coursework until the account is brought current. Our goal is to work with you to find solutions that keep your education on track.</p>\n</details>\n\n### Textbooks and Materials\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Do I need to purchase textbooks separately?</strong></summary>\n<p>Excel High School provides all required learning materials digitally within your courses. Our curriculum is designed to be self-contained, eliminating the need for additional textbook purchases. All readings, videos, interactive activities, and assessments are integrated into the learning management system. For some advanced courses, we may recommend optional supplementary materials, but these are never required to successfully complete coursework.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How do I access my course materials?</strong></summary>\n<p>All course materials are available through your student portal after logging in. Navigate to \"My Courses\" to see your active classes. Each course contains modules with all necessary learning materials. Materials are presented in a variety of formats including text, videos, interactive activities, and downloadable PDFs. Most materials can be accessed on any device with internet connection, though some interactive elements work best on computers or tablets.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Can I download materials to study offline?</strong></summary>\n<p>Yes, many course materials can be downloaded for offline study. Look for the download icon next to PDF documents, study guides, and worksheet activities. Video content must typically be viewed online, but reading materials can often be saved locally. We recommend completing assessments and quizzes when you have a stable internet connection to ensure your progress is properly recorded in the system.</p>\n</details>\n\n### Course Performance\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>What happens if I fail a course?</strong></summary>\n<p>At Excel High School, we're committed to your success. If you don't achieve a passing grade (typically 60% or higher, depending on your program), you have options. You may retake the course at a discounted rate, or in some cases, complete targeted remediation covering only the areas where you struggled. Before a course is considered failed, your instructor will reach out to offer support and intervention strategies. We recommend contacting your instructor early if you're finding course material challenging.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How can I get help if I'm struggling with coursework?</strong></summary>\n<p>Excel High School offers multiple layers of academic support. Your first resource is your course instructor, who can be contacted through the messaging system in your student portal. Additionally, we offer tutoring services, study skills workshops, and peer study groups. For technical issues, our IT support team is available during business hours. Remember that being proactive about seeking help is a sign of commitment to your education, not weakness.</p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Can I get an extension if I need more time to complete a course?</strong></summary>\n<p>Yes, Excel High School understands that life circumstances may occasionally impact your studies. Course extensions are available upon request. The first extension (typically 30 days) is often provided at no additional cost, while longer extensions may incur a small fee.
