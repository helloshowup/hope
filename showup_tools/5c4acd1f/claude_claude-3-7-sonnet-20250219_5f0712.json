Understanding how to transfer your existing credits is essential for planning your path to graduation efficiently. Excel High School recognizes that many students have completed coursework elsewhere and offers a straightforward process for evaluating and accepting qualifying credits. This guide will walk you through the types of credits accepted and the steps to submit your previous academic work for review.\n\n## Accepted Credit Sources\n\nExcel High School accepts credits from several different sources, provided they meet our academic standards:\n\n### Regionally Accredited U.S. Schools\nCredits earned at regionally accredited schools throughout the United States are generally accepted. These include:\n- Public high schools\n- Private high schools with regional accreditation\n- Accredited online schools\n- Community colleges or universities (for dual enrollment credits)\n\n### Qualified Homeschool Programs\nExcel High School recognizes homeschool credits when properly documented. Acceptable homeschool documentation includes:\n- Detailed homeschool transcripts showing:\n  - Course names\n  - Letter grades or percentages\n  - Credits earned\n  - Completion dates\n- Course descriptions and curriculum information\n- Documentation of instructional hours (75+ hours typically equals one credit)\n- Portfolios of student work (when applicable)\n\n### International Transcripts\nStudents with academic records from outside the United States can have their credits evaluated through:\n- Professional credential evaluation services (like World Education Services or Educational Credential Evaluators)\n- Translation of non-English transcripts by certified translators\n- Verification of equivalency to U.S. educational standards\n\n## How to Submit Your Transcripts\n\nFollow these steps to have your previous credits evaluated and applied toward your Excel High School diploma:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Your Documentation\nCollect all official transcripts and supporting documentation from your previous schools or homeschool program.

Clear, straightforward language appropriate for high school students without unnecessary complexity\n2. Organized structure with logical flow from introduction to next steps\n3. Included the most important practical information from all versions:\n   - Specific credit sources and documentation requirements\n   - Exact step-by-step submission process with current contact information\n   - Clear timeline expectations\n   - Important transfer limits (75% maximum, 6-credit residency requirement)\n\nI maintained the engaging second-person perspective (\"your credits\") to create a direct connection with students. The content includes concrete examples and specific action steps rather than abstract concepts, which helps self-paced learners understand exactly what they need to do.\n\nI also ensured the information connects to the \"Understanding Transfer Limits\" mentioned in the context as the next lesson, providing a smooth transition between topics. The tip box provides additional resources for students who need more detailed information, supporting diverse learning needs.\n\nThe final version is comprehensive yet concise, with information chunked into manageable sections with clear headings to support online reading patterns.\n</explanation>"}
