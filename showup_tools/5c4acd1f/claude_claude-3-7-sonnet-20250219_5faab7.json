Accreditation—the process that verifies a school meets established educational standards—directly impacts whether colleges, universities, employers and the military will accept your diploma. At Excel High School, we hold respected accreditations that demonstrate our commitment to quality education. Let's explore what these credentials mean for your academic journey.\n\n## Regional Accreditation through Cognia\n\nExcel High School is regionally accredited through Cognia, one of the most respected accrediting organisations in the United States. Cognia formed when three regional accrediting bodies merged:\n\n1. **North Central Association (NCA CASI)** - Serving schools in the north central region of the United States since 1895\n   \n2. **Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS CASI)** - Accrediting schools throughout the southern states since 1895\n   \n3. **Northwest Accreditation Commission (NWAC)** - Serving schools in the northwestern United States\n\nWhat does this mean for you? Colleges and universities across the country will recognise your Excel High School diploma and credits. Cognia evaluates our:\n- Curriculum quality\n- Teaching effectiveness\n- Leadership\n- Use of resources\n- Student performance\n\nThis thorough evaluation confirms that your education at Excel High School meets high standards that prepare you for success after graduation.\n\n## Systems Accreditation by Middle States Association\n\nExcel High School has also earned systems accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA). With a history dating back to 1887, MSA is among the oldest and most respected accrediting bodies in the United States.\n\nUnlike more limited evaluations, MSA systems accreditation examines our entire educational framework, including:\n\n- School leadership and organisation\n- Educational programmes and curriculum\n- Assessment of student learning\n- Student support services\n- Resources and facilities\n\nThis additional accreditation provides further assurance that your Excel High School education meets rigorous standards recognised throughout the United States and internationally.\n\n## Why Accreditation Matters for You\n\nAccreditation directly shapes your future opportunities:\n\n- **College Acceptance**: Colleges and universities recognise diplomas from regionally accredited schools like Excel High School\n  \n- **Credit Transfer**: Credits you earn at Excel High School can transfer to other accredited schools if you move or change schools\n  \n- **Financial Aid**: Students from accredited schools qualify for federal financial aid programmes when they attend college\n  \n- **Employment**: Many employers verify that job applicants' diplomas come from accredited schools\n  \n- **Military Enlistment**: The U.S. military recognises diplomas from regionally accredited schools\n\nHaving dual accreditation through both Cognia and the Middle States Association gives you a significant advantage as you plan your next steps after high school.\n\n## Verification of Accreditation\n\nYou and your parents can verify Excel High School's accreditation status directly through the official websites of Cognia and the Middle States Association.
