This lesson breaks down the different types of work you'll be doing, when to expect your marks, and how to use feedback to improve your performance.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Types of Assignments\n\nAt Excel High School, you'll work with two main types of assignments: auto-graded quizzes and instructor-graded writing assignments.\n\n**Auto-graded quizzes** are typically multiple-choice, true/false, or matching questions that test your understanding of key concepts. These quizzes are scored immediately by our learning system, giving you instant feedback on your performance. When you submit an auto-graded quiz, you'll see your score right away, along with which questions you answered correctly or incorrectly.\n\n**Instructor-graded writing assignments** require more in-depth thinking and analysis. These might include essays, short answer responses, research papers, or projects. Your instructor personally reviews these assignments, evaluating your critical thinking, analysis, and communication skills. Writing assignments give you the chance to express your ideas and demonstrate deeper understanding of the course material.\n\nKnowing these different assignment types helps you prepare properly. For quizzes, you'll want to focus on reviewing key terms and concepts. For writing assignments, you should allow more time for planning, drafting, and revising your work before submission.\n\n### Core Concept 2: The 48-Business-Hour Grading Window\n\nWhen you submit an instructor-graded assignment at Excel High School, you can expect to receive your mark and feedback within 48 business hours. This means your instructor will review your work and provide feedback within two business days (Monday through Friday, excluding holidays).\n\nHere's how this works in practice:\n- If you submit an assignment on Monday at 10 AM, you should receive feedback by Wednesday at 10 AM.\n- If you submit on Friday afternoon, you'll likely receive feedback by Tuesday afternoon, as weekends don't count toward the 48-hour window.\n\nThis consistent grading timeline helps you:\n- Plan your study schedule more effectively\n- Know when to expect feedback that might help with upcoming assignments\n- Maintain steady progress through your courses\n\nFactor in this timeline when planning your work, especially if you have multiple assignments due across different courses. Submitting work well before deadlines gives you the advantage of incorporating feedback into future assignments.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Personalised Feedback Process\n\nOne of the most valuable aspects of your Excel High School education is the personalised feedback you'll receive on your instructor-graded assignments. This feedback goes beyond just a numerical mark and helps you develop as a student.\n\nWhen your instructor reviews your work, they'll provide comments on:\n- The strengths of your assignment\n- Areas where you can improve\n- Specific suggestions for developing your skills\n- Connections between your work and course objectives\n\nThis personalised feedback works as a conversation between you and your instructor, even though you're learning online at your own pace. It helps you understand not just what mark you earned, but why you earned it and how you can do better next time.\n\nTo make the most of this feedback:\n1. Take time to carefully read all comments\n2. Compare the feedback to the original assignment instructions\n3. Note patterns in feedback across different assignments\n4. Apply suggestions to future work\n5. Don't hesitate to ask questions if something isn't clear\n\nBy actively engaging with your feedback, you'll steadily improve your academic skills throughout your time at Excel High School.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your learning style. How might auto-graded quizzes help you differently than instructor-graded writing assignments? Which do you think will be more challenging for you, and why?\n\n2. How will you incorporate the 48-business-hour grading window into your study planning? Consider creating a simple weekly schedule that accounts for this timeline.\n\n3. Reflect on a time when you received helpful feedback on your work. What made the feedback useful? How did you apply it to improve your skills?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1.

It helps students understand their strengths and areas for improvement\n   - D.
