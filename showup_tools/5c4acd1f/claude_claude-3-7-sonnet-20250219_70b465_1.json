Back in 2005, when online education was still finding its feet, a group of forward-thinking educators spotted a gap. They saw that many students weren't thriving in traditional classrooms and needed something different. That insight sparked what would become Excel High School – a place where quality education could reach anyone, anywhere. As you begin your studies here, you're joining thousands of graduates who've found success through our unique approach to learning.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Founding Year and Original Vision\n\nExcel High School was established in 2005 when online education was still emerging as an alternative to traditional schooling. The founders noticed that physical schools weren't working well for students with unique circumstances, scheduling challenges, or different learning preferences.\n\nThe original vision centred on three key principles:\n\n1. **Accessibility** - Creating educational opportunities that go beyond physical limitations and geographic boundaries\n2. **Flexibility** - Developing programmes that adapt to students' needs rather than forcing students to conform to rigid structures\n3. **Quality** - Maintaining high academic standards while delivering curriculum in innovative ways\n\nBack in 2005, many people doubted whether quality education could happen online. Excel's founders saw things differently. They recognised how technology could connect students to education regardless of where they lived, their physical abilities, or their life circumstances. This forward-thinking approach put Excel High School at the forefront of online education when such options were scarce.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Excel Education Systems as Parent Company\n\nExcel High School operates under the umbrella of Excel Education Systems, the parent company. This structure gives you real advantages as a student by providing stability, resources, and educational expertise beyond what a standalone school might offer.\n\nExcel Education Systems brings together:\n- Educational experts who design curriculum aligned with standards\n- Technology specialists who maintain and improve the learning platforms\n- Student support professionals who provide personalised assistance\n- Administrative teams who keep everything running smoothly\n\nHow does this benefit you? It means you'll have access to well-designed courses, reliable technology, and helpful support services throughout your learning journey. As Excel Education Systems has grown over the years, it has allowed Excel High School to expand its programmes while maintaining consistent quality – something you'll appreciate as you progress through your studies.\n\n## Core Concept 3: Mission to Serve Diverse Learners\n\nAt its heart, Excel High School exists to serve both traditional and non-traditional learners with flexible, high-quality education. We recognise that students come to us with different backgrounds, goals, and circumstances.\n\nIf you're a traditional learner (typically ages 14-18), you'll benefit from structured curriculum and accredited programmes that meet or exceed state and national standards. You might have chosen online education for its flexibility, specialised course offerings, or personalised learning approach.\n\nNon-traditional learners at Excel include:\n- Adult learners returning to complete their education\n- Students with health challenges that make traditional attendance difficult\n- Professional athletes or performers with demanding schedules\n- Military family members who relocate frequently\n- Students who travel or have other commitments that require flexibility\n\nThis inclusive approach reflects our commitment to educational equity—the belief that quality education should be available to everyone. By offering flexible scheduling, personalised support, and multiple programme options, Excel High School creates pathways to academic success for students who might otherwise face barriers in traditional educational settings.\n\n## Over to You:\n\n1. How does Excel High School's founding vision of accessibility align with your personal educational needs or circumstances?\n\n2. In what ways might the flexible, high-quality education offered by Excel High School benefit you in today's rapidly changing world?\n\n3. Consider Excel's mission to serve both traditional and non-traditional learners. What advantages might come from being part of a learning community with diverse student experiences and backgrounds?\n\n## Summary\n\nExcel High School, founded in 2005, began with a vision to make quality education accessible through online learning. As part of Excel Education Systems, the school benefits from strong organisational support that enhances your educational experience. Throughout its history, Excel has stayed true to its core mission of serving diverse learners with flexible, high-quality education that adapts to their needs.
