Founded in 2005 with a vision of making quality education accessible to all learners, Excel High School has grown while staying true to its original mission. Understanding the school's founding principles helps you appreciate the values that shape your educational experience today. As a student, knowing this history connects you to the thousands of graduates who have successfully completed their education through our programs.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Founding Year and Original Vision\n\nExcel High School was established in 2005 when online education was still emerging as an alternative to traditional schooling. The founders recognized that many students weren't being effectively served by physical schools, particularly those with unique circumstances, scheduling challenges, or different learning preferences.\n\nThe original vision centered on three key principles:\n\n1. **Accessibility** - Creating educational opportunities that go beyond physical limitations and geographic boundaries\n2. **Flexibility** - Developing programs that adapt to students' needs rather than forcing students to conform to rigid structures\n3. **Quality** - Maintaining high academic standards while delivering curriculum in innovative ways\n\nIn 2005, many people questioned whether quality education could be delivered online. Excel's founders saw the potential of technology to make education available to students regardless of where they lived, their physical abilities, or their life circumstances. This forward-thinking approach positioned Excel High School as a pioneer in online education when such options were limited.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Excel Education Systems as Parent Company\n\nExcel High School operates under the umbrella of Excel Education Systems, the parent company. This organizational structure provides important benefits to you as a student by creating stability, resources, and educational expertise beyond what a standalone school might offer.\n\nExcel Education Systems brings together:\n- Educational experts who design curriculum aligned with standards\n- Technology specialists who maintain and improve the learning platforms\n- Student support professionals who provide personalized assistance\n- Administrative teams who ensure smooth operations\n\nThis parent company relationship strengthens your educational experience in several ways. It provides the infrastructure, technology resources, and financial stability that allow the school to focus on education. For you as a student, this means access to well-designed courses, reliable technology, and professional support services that enhance your learning experience.\n\nAs Excel Education Systems has grown, it has enabled Excel High School to expand its programs while maintaining consistent quality – something that directly benefits you throughout your educational journey.\n\n## Core Concept 3: Mission to Serve Diverse Learners\n\nAt the heart of Excel High School's identity is the mission to serve both traditional and non-traditional learners with flexible, high-quality education. This mission acknowledges that students come to education with different backgrounds, goals, and circumstances.\n\nAs a traditional learner (typically ages 14-18), you benefit from structured curriculum and accredited programs that meet or exceed state and national standards. You might have chosen online education for its flexibility, specialized course offerings, or personalized learning approach.\n\nNon-traditional learners at Excel include:\n- Adult learners returning to complete their education\n- Students with health challenges that make traditional attendance difficult\n- Professional athletes or performers with demanding schedules\n- Military family members who relocate frequently\n- Students who travel or have other commitments that require flexibility\n\nThis inclusive approach reflects a commitment to educational equity—the belief that quality education should be accessible to everyone. By offering flexible scheduling, personalized support, and multiple program options, Excel High School creates pathways to academic success for students who might otherwise face barriers in traditional educational settings.\n\n## Over to You:\n\n1.
