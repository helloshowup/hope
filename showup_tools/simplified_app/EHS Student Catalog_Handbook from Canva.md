1. # **Introduction to Excel High School** 

## *Purpose of the Student Handbook*

The Student Handbook serves as a comprehensive guide to support students as they begin their academic journey with \[Excel High School, Excel Middle School, and Northgate Academy\]. It outlines the essential information, policies, and resources needed to navigate our virtual learning environment successfully. From understanding academic expectations and enrollment procedures to discovering enrichment opportunities and accessing support services, this handbook empowers students to make informed decisions, stay engaged, and thrive in an online setting.

Aligned with our mission to provide flexible, accredited, and student-centered education, this handbook also introduces students to our vibrant virtual community, university partnerships, and career readiness programs. Whether pursuing a full-time diploma, single-course recovery, or preparing for college and beyond, students will find clear guidance and support throughout each stage of their experience.

In addition to its role as a student resource, the handbook functions as the official document governing academic policies, program requirements, and accreditation standards. Students are generally held to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment. However, Excel Education Systems, Inc. reserves the right to modify programs or policies as needed, and when changes occur, reasonable efforts will be made to help students transition effectively and remain on track for graduation.

## ***Reservation of Rights***

***\[Excel High School, Excel Middle School and Northgate Academy\], reserves the right to revise, modify, or discontinue policies, procedures, academic programs, and other provisions outlined in this handbook at any time, with or without prior notice, in accordance with applicable accreditation and licensing requirements. This handbook is not a binding contract but serves as a general guide to the school’s current programs and expectations.***

***While students may be permitted to complete their academic program under the requirements in place at the time of their enrollment (as outlined in our grandfather clause policy), revised policies may, in some cases, supersede prior guidelines. When feasible, the school will provide support to ensure a smooth transition under updated policies or academic structures.***

## *History of Excel High School*

Excel High School, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Excel Education Systems, Inc. (EES), operates as a non-public school headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Excel Education Systems, Inc. holds corporate systems (district) accreditation by Cognia. Since its establishment in 2005, Excel High School has assisted thousands of high school-age and adult learners in graduating and progressing to higher education, employment, military enlistment, and job advancement.

Excel was founded by a group of educators, business people, and technology experts who understand the potential of the Internet to provide a world-class education to students who might not have access to such education through any other means. Every one of the school’s founders is or has been a parent of school-age children and knows from personal experience the importance of providing their children with a superior education.

The school founders searched for like-minded administrators and coaches – people passionate about education, committed to student learning, and interested in creating a safe school environment where student needs drive the overall direction and the daily decisions of all individuals involved in the school. Our coaches come from all over the United States and are highly qualified to teach in their respective subject areas.

Most importantly, Excel High School is made up of students who are committed to their learning and interested in pursuing their education in a unique, safe, and flexible environment. Students may be looking for additional credits to accelerate their learning, or a few makeup credits so they can graduate from their local school on time. Students may be looking for a flexible online middle or high school where they can more easily blend school with work, travel, or home responsibilities. Online students may be excited about trying a new form of schooling – more vibrant, up-to-date, and personalized than anything they have previously experienced.

Excel Education Systems operates Excel High School and Northgate Academy for grades 9-12. Additionally, Excel High School's middle school division offers education for grades 6-8. Excel’s college division provides undergraduate certificates and credits in various fields, including business, paralegal studies, criminal justice, health care, and information technology.

## *Legal Governance*

Excel’s school code assigned by the Department of Education is: 0284-31-022. Excel’s national school (CEEB) code is: 240-707.

3. ### **Starting Your Academic Journey**

## *Academic Expectations*

By the time you’ve gotten this far, you certainly know that Excel High School is a school that is quite different from traditional brick-and-mortar schools. Because of Excel’s unique nature, students must take primary responsibility for their own learning. Self-motivation, dedication to learning, and regular participation are essential. The staff at Excel High School is available to support the student's education, but in reality, it is the student who determines their own level of success.

At Excel High School, we offer a learning experience that is intentionally different from the traditional brick-and-mortar model. As an online student, you have the flexibility to learn on your own schedule—but with that flexibility comes greater responsibility.

Success in our virtual learning environment requires self-discipline, consistent effort, and a strong commitment to your goals. Students are expected to take primary ownership of their education by actively participating in coursework, managing their time effectively, and staying on track with assignments and deadlines.

While our dedicated instructors, academic coaches, and support staff are here to guide and encourage you every step of the way, your success ultimately depends on your engagement and determination. The students who thrive at Excel are those who are motivated, proactive, and ready to take charge of their learning journey.

Remember, the level of success you achieve is directly related to the effort you invest—and we’re here to help you make the most of that investment.

## *Transfer Credits*

Excel High School proudly welcomes transfer credits from a variety of educational backgrounds, including U.S.-based accredited schools, international institutions, qualified homeschool programs, and foreign academic records validated by our credential evaluation partners. We are committed to providing a smooth transition for students continuing their academic journey with us.

We accept transfer credits from the following sources:

* Regionally or nationally accredited U.S. high schools  
* Public and charter schools recognized by the U.S. Department of Education  
* Accredited international schools recognized by their country’s Ministry of Education  
* Qualified homeschool providers meeting state and academic standards  
* Foreign academic transcripts evaluated and certified by approved credential evaluation services

Students interested in transferring credits should contact the Registrar’s Office for detailed guidance or refer to the [**Excel High School Credit Transfer Policy**](http://www.excelhighschool.com/excel-high-school-credit-transfer-policy).(Need to link to new website page).

In accordance with accreditation guidelines, Excel High School allows the transfer of up to **75% of the total credits required for graduation**. To earn an EHS diploma, all students must complete a **minimum of 5.5 to 6 credits** directly through Excel High School, regardless of how many credits have been previously earned.

We are here to assist you in maximizing your prior learning while ensuring you meet the standards required for graduation through our accredited program.

**Academic Records Policy**

Excel High School recognizes 6th grade as a transitional entry point into middle school and, in most cases, does not require incoming 6th‑grade students to submit academic records. However, students who enroll mid‑year for a single 6th‑grade semester must provide an official transcript or report card from an accredited school to verify completion of a full 6th‑grade record prior to placement into 7th grade. For all students entering grades 7–12, whether coming from traditional schools or homeschooling, submission of official academic documentation \- such as an official transcript from an accredited school, report card, or a signed homeschool attestation form \- is required to ensure appropriate placement, accurate evaluation of transfer credits, and alignment with graduation requirements.

Adult learners (age 18+) who begin a high school program at Excel High School with the intent to complete all graduation credits through the school are not required to submit prior academic records at the time of enrollment. If an adult student wishes to have previous coursework considered for transfer credit, appropriate documentation must be submitted for review. For domestic students, this includes an official transcript from an accredited school. For international students, academic credentials must be evaluated by Scholaro, an approved Educational Credential Evaluator. Homeschool credit transfers are not accepted for adult students.

## *Homeschool Credits and Transfer*

Homeschool credits are accepted according to the following policy: [(Click Here)](http://www.excelhighschool.com/homeschool_html) (Need to link to new website page).

## *Guidelines for International Students*

Excel High School is a fully online school and does not issue Form I-20 for F-1 student visas. U.S. immigration regulations require that international students on an F-1 visa attend schools that offer in-person instruction. Because all coursework at Excel High School is completed online, students cannot use Excel High School enrollment to obtain or maintain an F-1 visa.

International students are welcome to enroll in EHS courses from outside the United States. However, it is the student’s responsibility to ensure that online education meets their country’s academic and legal requirements.

Excel High School accepts international (non-U.S.) credits only under specific conditions. If the original transcript from an international school is in English, includes a letter or numerical grade, and lists credits earned, it may be accepted \- provided the transcript is emailed directly from the school to the Excel High School Registrar’s Office. Transcripts that meet these requirements must be sent to records@excelhighschool.com. In compliance with state law, Excel High School cannot legally accept official transcripts submitted by students.

If the transcript does not meet the aforementioned requirements, or if there is any uncertainty about the document’s completeness or clarity, students must have their academic credentials evaluated by Scholaro, an approved Educational Credential Evaluator. For more information or to begin the evaluation process, visit Scholaro’s website at www.scholaro.com. All Scholaro evaluations must be completed on a course-by-course basis, and it is the student’s responsibility to pay all associated fees and ensure that Scholaro sends the official evaluation report directly to Excel High School.

**Please note that Excel High School will not review or evaluate any transcripts until the student is officially enrolled and the first tuition payment has been received.**

For students residing outside the United States, Excel High School offers Apostille and Legalization services to authenticate academic credentials for international use. This includes certification of diplomas and transcripts through the Secretary of State. If requested, Excel High School can mail the authenticated documents to the student’s home country’s embassy. However, Excel does not obtain the embassy stamp on behalf of students. If needed, students must coordinate directly with their embassy to complete the final steps.

**Enrollment Policy for State-Funded Programs (School Vouchers, ESA, etc.)**

Excel High School is committed to delivering high-quality, accessible education to students participating in public education initiatives, including those funded by state agencies such as voucher programs and Education Savings Accounts (ESAs). This policy outlines the specific terms and responsibilities for families or individuals engaged in these state-supported programs.

In instances where the requirements of a state-funded program conflict with provisions outlined in the Excel High School Enrollment Agreement or Student Handbook, the regulations and guidelines of the applicable state agency will take precedence.

**Tuition and Financial Responsibility**

Tuition for students participating in state-funded programs may be paid in installments or disbursements in accordance with the payment schedule established by the applicable  state agency or funding manager. Regardless of the payment method, parents or guardians remain ultimately  responsible for ensuring that the total tuition amount is satisfied. This includes cooperating with Excel High School by providing all required documentation, addressing any delays in funding disbursement, and actively resolving funding shortfalls. In the event that state funding is denied, delayed, or does not cover the full cost of tuition and applicable educational expenses, the parent or guardian agrees to cover any remaining balance.

**Attendance Tracking and Verification**

State-funded programs often mandate  documented proof of attendance as a condition for continued funding. Parents and students must comply with any attendance tracking or verification protocols required by their funding agency. This may include submitting attendance logs, verifying participation in coursework, or providing supporting documentation upon request. Consistent engagement with course materials and completion of assignments is expected to support ongoing eligibility for funding. Given the variability in attendance or participation requirements across state-funded programs, parents or guardians are strongly encouraged to review the specific guidelines set forth by their state agency. If any aspects of the requirements are unclear, it is advised that they contact the agency directly for clarification and additional information.

 

**Norm-Referenced Testing** 

If participation in nationally norm-referenced testing is required by the funding agency, students are required to complete these assessments during the designated testing windows. As a condition of enrollment, these test results must be reported to  Excel High School to demonstrate compliance with the program. Failure to complete required testing may result in the suspension or termination  of funding and could jeopardize the students’ continued enrollment.

**Parent and Guardian Reporting Obligations**

Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring all required  documentation is completed and reported to the appropriate agency to maintain the student’s enrollment and funding status. These reports must be submitted according to the timelines established by the funding agency. Failure to comply with the required documentation may result in the loss of funding or removal from the program in accordance with the state-funding agency rules. For more details on reporting requirements, please contact your state agency.

**State-Funded Program Acknowledgment**

By enrolling in Excel High School through a state-funded program, parents or guardians acknowledge their full understanding and acceptance of the terms outlined in this policy. Participation in the program signifies agreement to meet all associated responsibilities, including but not limited to tuition, attendance, standardized testing, submission of required documentation, and consistent communication.

In the event that state funding is suspended or discontinued, the parent or guardian agrees to assume full financial responsibility for covering tuition costs to maintain the student’s enrollment at Excel High School. Failure to fulfill this obligation may result in the student’s temporary removal from the program. Access to coursework will be reinstated once payment has been received.

Noncompliance with any component of this policy may lead to consequences such as suspension of state funding, restricted access to courses, or administrative withdrawal from Excel High School. **For specific program obligations and expectations, please refer to the signed agreement with your respective state agency.**

**State-Funded Program Resources and Support**

Excel High School proudly partners with several state-funded programs to support students in achieving their educational goals. To assist families in understanding and navigating the requirements of these programs, we offer a variety of resources. For more detailed information, please visit the following pages:

* [www.excelhighschool.com/state-funded-programs](http://www.excelhighschool.com/state-funded-programs) (\<---Insert web link here)  
* [www.northgateacademy.com/state-funded-programs](http://www.northgateacademy.com/state-funded-programs) (\<---Insert web link here) 

**Refund Policy for State Funded Programs (School Vouchers, ESA, etc.)**

If a student's enrollment is funded, in whole or in part, by a state-funded program \- such as a school voucher, education savings account (ESA), or any similar public education funding initiative \- any refunds that may become due under the terms of the student's enrollment will be issued directly to the state agency that provided the funding. Under no circumstances will refunds from state-funded programs be issued to the student, parent, guardian, or any third party.

Excel High School is legally obligated to comply with all applicable state laws, agency regulations, and program-specific refund requirements. In the event of a withdrawal or cancellation, any tuition, fees, or other payments made on behalf of the student through a state-funded program will be refunded in accordance with the applicable state agency’s guidelines and policies. Students and families acknowledge that the administration of state funds carries unique responsibilities, and Excel High School must adhere strictly to those legal requirements.

Students and families expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree that:

* Funds disbursed by a state-funded program are public funds.

* Refund and withdrawal procedures for students receiving state-funded support will be governed by the specific regulations and requirements of the state that issued the funding.

* Refunds attributable to payments made through state-funded programs must be returned to the funding agency, not to the individual student, parent, or guardian.

Failure to comply with these terms may result in administrative actions, including but not limited to the withholding of transcripts, diplomas, or access to enrollment services, until all financial obligations and refund procedures have been fulfilled in accordance with the requirements of Excel High School and any applicable state-funded educational program.

## *Enrollment Status*

**Full-Time vs. Part-Time Status**

Excel High School supports both full-time and part-time students with the same level of commitment, ensuring every learner receives personalized attention regardless of their enrollment status. At the time of enrollment, students select their full-time or part-time designation and are provided with a customized learning plan tailored to their academic goals. The key features of each enrollment option are summarized below.

### *Part-Time Students*

* Part-time students typically take between 1 and 4 credits, while full-time students enroll in 4.5 to 6 credits. Part-time enrollment offers the flexibility to complete a single course or several courses, making it ideal for students supplementing their education, focusing on credit recovery, or needing to complete just a semester of coursework for their grade level.

### *Full-Time Students*

* Full-time students enroll in 4.5 to a maximum of 6.5 credits per grade level. While 4.5 credits meet the minimum for full-time status, students typically take 5 to 6 credits to remain on track for graduation and meet all diploma requirements at Excel High School.  
* Students enrolled full-time at Excel High School may not be concurrently enrolled full-time at another school or in an additional program within the institution.  
* Each grade level typically includes the following course requirements:  
  * At least 1 English course  
  * At least 1 Math course  
  * At least 1 Science course  
  * At least 1 Social Studies course  
  * At least 2 Elective credits  
* Some flexibility may be allowed in how certain credits are distributed, particularly in the senior year, to ensure students are following the best path toward meeting graduation requirements.

### *Middle School Full-Time Status*

* **Sixth Grade:** Full-time status requires enrollment in four courses.  
* **Seventh and Eighth Grades:** Full-time status requires enrollment in five courses.

## *Participation Time & Learning Requirements*

Excel High School offers a flexible, self-paced learning environment designed to accommodate diverse student needs and learning styles. While students enjoy the freedom to study from anywhere and on their own schedule, consistent and substantive participation is essential for academic progress and compliance with compulsory education laws for students under the age of 18\.

### *Time Expectations by Course Type:*

* **Full Grade Level (Two Semesters):** Students are given **12 months** to complete a full academic grade level.  
* **Advanced Placement (AP) Courses:** Students have **5 months per semester** (10 months total) to complete AP courses.  
* **Individual Standard Courses:** These are designed to be completed within **6 months**.  
* **Course Extensions:** Extensions may be granted for an additional **$200 fee**, pending approval from a designated school representative.

To stay on track, students should plan to spend approximately **45 minutes to 1 hour per course, per day**, five days per week. This schedule supports successful completion of coursework within the intended 4–6 month timeline.

### *Participation Requirements:*

Students under the age of 18 are expected to:

* Maintain a **minimum of 20 hours of academic engagement per week** across all active courses.  
* Log in regularly and demonstrate **substantive participation**, which includes completing assignments, taking assessments, participating in discussions, and communicating with academic staff.

Failure to meet these expectations may result in academic warnings, account review, or administrative withdrawal. Students who do not participate in their coursework for **30 consecutive days or more** may receive a **Notice of Intent to Withdraw**, and their enrollment may be subject to cancellation in accordance with the school’s non-participation policy.

### *Expectations for Adult Learners:*

Adult students are not subject to compulsory attendance requirements but must still demonstrate a consistent pattern of academic activity. Students who are inactive for **60 consecutive days or more** may have their accounts locked and risk termination.

### *Communication and Flexibility:*

We understand that life circumstances vary. If a student anticipates an extended absence due to illness, travel, or personal obligations, it is essential to **notify the school in advance**. Our support team will work with students and families to make reasonable accommodations in alignment with school policies.

Success in our program requires commitment, discipline, and regular engagement. While Excel High School offers exceptional flexibility, consistent participation is the key to academic achievement and program completion.

**State Compulsory Attendance Laws**

**Compulsory Attendance Laws:** Students under the age of 18 are responsible for complying with their state's compulsory attendance laws. These laws vary by state, and it is the responsibility of parents/guardians to ensure compliance with their local education regulations. Excel High School does not monitor or enforce state attendance requirements. Parents should consult their local school district or state education agency for guidance on meeting attendance obligations.

For students utilizing government-funded programs such as vouchers, daily participation is required per state compulsory attendance laws. Extended absences will be reported to the student's home district for appropriate action. Students must maintain regular engagement in coursework to remain in good standing.

**Attendance Records:** Excel High School operates as a self-paced, asynchronous online institution and does not maintain traditional attendance records like public schools. However, student progress is tracked through course activity and engagement. Parents or guardians seeking verification of student participation may request progress reports through the school.

**Status Letters and Transcripts:** Excel High School provides status letters and transcripts upon request, provided the student has official transcripts on file (if they attended a previous high school), has successfully completed at least one course, and is current on all tuition payments.

4. # **Learning Environment and Time Management**

# 

## *Single Course Credit Recovery (Grades 6–12)*

Excel High School offers flexible, fully online **Single Course Recovery** for students in **grades 6–12** who need to retake previously failed or incomplete classes. These self-paced, teacher-supported courses are designed to help students catch up and stay on track for grade-level progression or high school graduation.  
Courses are aligned with national and state academic standards and include meaningful assessments to ensure subject mastery. Students have **up to 6 months** to complete each course. Tuition is billed per course.

✅ *Prior to enrollment, please confirm credit acceptance with your student’s current school or district.*

## *Course Extension Policy*

In extremely rare situations, Excel High School will approve a one-time per grade level, two-month extension allowing a student more time to finish a class. To be approved for an extension, the following criteria must be met:

1. **Reasonable Progress:**  
   * The student must have made reasonable progress toward course completion, as determined by the approval committee.  
2. **Legitimate Reason:**  
   * A legitimate reason for needing the extension must be submitted in writing.  
   * The explanation must be signed by both the student and a parent.  
   * The request must be submitted through the Learn Stage Help Desk which will route it to the approval committee.  
3. **Examples of Legitimate Reasons:**  
   * Unforeseen family emergencies.  
   * Personal or medical emergencies.  
   * Natural disasters.  
4. **Note:** Lack of time to communicate or participate will not be considered a legitimate reason for granting an extension.  
5. **Extension Cost:**  
   * The cost of a 2-month program extension is $200.00.

By adhering to this policy, Excel High School ensures that extensions are granted only in genuine cases of need, maintaining the integrity and accountability of its academic programs.

## *Communication & Login (Including Attendance, Participation, and Truancy)*

Consistent and meaningful participation is essential for student success in an online learning environment. At Excel High School, we monitor course engagement to ensure students are meeting academic expectations and complying with applicable state and local attendance laws.

While our program offers flexibility, students are still required to demonstrate **substantive participation** on a regular basis. This includes logging into each enrolled course, completing assignments, communicating with instructors, and engaging with course content.

To remain in good standing, students are expected to:

* Log in and actively participate in **each course at least three times per week**  
* Complete a **minimum of 20 hours of academic engagement per week**, especially if under the age of 18 and subject to compulsory education laws

### *Definition of Truancy:*

A student may be considered **truant** if they fail to participate in required instructional activities—without a valid excuse—for an extended period of time (e.g., 7 or more consecutive days or 15 days total within an academic year). In a virtual school setting, this includes failure to log in, complete coursework, or maintain communication with school staff. In such cases, the school may be required to notify the student’s parent/guardian, withdraw the student from enrollment, or report the absence to the appropriate local or state educational authority.

### *Parent and Guardian Responsibilities:*

Parents or guardians of students under age 18 are responsible for ensuring regular academic participation and may be subject to their state's compulsory attendance laws. We encourage families to become familiar with their local requirements and support their students in maintaining a consistent schedule.

### *Absences and Communication:*

If a student anticipates an absence due to travel, personal obligations, or other commitments, they should notify the school at least **one week in advance**. In the event of illness or emergency, the student or guardian should notify the school as soon as possible to discuss accommodations or course extensions.

Students may communicate with staff by submitting a **Help Desk Ticket in LearnStage**, our learning management system. Excel staff and academic coaches are committed to supporting students through timely, responsive communication.

## *School Academic Calendar and Hours of Operation*

At Excel High School, flexibility is at the heart of our educational model. Our virtual learning platform is accessible **24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year**, allowing students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule—anytime, anywhere with a reliable internet connection.

Although coursework can be accessed year-round, the **school office operates Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (U.S. Central Standard Time)**. During these hours, our academic coaches, instructors, and support staff are available to answer questions, provide assistance, and ensure your academic experience remains smooth and successful.

The **school office is closed on weekends** and during nationally recognized holidays. However, students may continue progressing through their courses uninterrupted—even when the office is closed. Our **Help Desk Ticket system remains available 24/7**, and tickets will be addressed during regular business hours.

We believe that this combination of round-the-clock access to coursework and responsive weekday support from our professional team is one of Excel High School’s greatest strengths—and a key advantage for students and families seeking a flexible, high-quality education.

### *Observed Holidays*

Excel High School observes the following U.S. holidays. When a holiday falls on a weekend, it may be observed on the nearest weekday:

At Excel High School, each course is thoughtfully structured to provide a comprehensive, engaging, and interactive learning experience. Courses are organized into a series of lessons, each designed to promote mastery through a variety of instructional tools and assessments.

Each lesson typically includes:

* A **digital textbook**  
* **Instructional resources and lectures**  
* **Interactive activities and assignments**

### *Assessment & Grading*

(Note: AP® courses may require supplementary materials or hard-copy textbooks.)

### 

### *Course Load and Progression*

Students typically enroll in five to six courses at a time, depending on their academic goals and graduation plan. Courses are sequenced intentionally to support cumulative learning and skill development. Students are expected to follow the designated course progression for their grade level unless transfer credits have been applied and an adjusted course plan has been approved.

This structured yet flexible model allows students to take ownership of their learning while progressing through a high-quality, accredited curriculum at their own pace.

## *Study Tips for Online Learning Success*

Excel High School provides students with a flexible, self-paced learning environment designed to support a wide range of learning styles and academic goals. Success in an asynchronous online program requires personal responsibility, consistent engagement, and smart study strategies. Whether you’re preparing for assessments, working on assignments, or building long-term academic habits, the tips below will help you stay focused, productive, and successful.

### *1\. Understand the Grading Rubric*

Most written assignments include a **grading rubric**—a detailed guide used to assess your performance.

* Review the rubric **before** beginning the assignment to understand the expectations.  
* Use the rubric as a **checklist** while you work to ensure you cover all required components.  
* Aim to meet the **highest criteria** outlined in the rubric for the best possible score.

Rubrics ensure that all student work is graded consistently and fairly. By understanding how your work will be evaluated, you can take direct steps to improve your outcomes.

### *2\. Know When Assignments Use Specific Answers*

Some assignments, especially in math, science, and grammar-based lessons, may have **objectively correct answers** and are graded using an answer key rather than a rubric.

* Pay close attention to instructions for these assignments.  
* Review any provided examples or reference materials to guide your answers.  
* Accuracy matters—double-check your work before submitting.

### *3\. Prepare for Multiple-Choice Assessments*

Multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank assessments are used throughout Excel courses to measure comprehension.

* Study regularly—**avoid cramming** right before a test.  
* Take organized notes while reading or watching instructional videos.  
* Review any incorrect answers from past quizzes to better understand the material.  
* Use **practice questions**, where available, to test your knowledge before taking graded assessments.

Most multiple-choice exams are **automatically graded** upon submission, so you’ll receive instant feedback to help guide your next steps.

### *4\. Use BRYTE AI Tutor for On-Demand Support*

When you need help outside of normal school hours—or simply want quick, intelligent support—turn to [**BRYTE AI Tutor**](https://www.excelhighschool.com/student-resources/bryte-ai-tutoring).

* **Proofread** your assignments before submitting.  
* Use the **EHS Writing Lab** to strengthen your writing skills and improve clarity and structure.  
* Read instructor feedback carefully and apply it to future work.

Written assignments are typically graded within **48 business hours**, and feedback is provided to help you grow.

* Set aside **dedicated time** each day for schoolwork.  
* Create a **weekly study plan** to stay on track with all courses.  
* Break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks.  
* Regularly check your course dashboard to monitor progress and upcoming assignments.

### *Self-Paced Learning and Progress Monitoring*

All diploma tracks are fully **self-paced**, giving students the ability to set a schedule that aligns with their personal goals, learning style, and availability. Students are encouraged to complete **1 to 2 lessons per week, per course**, to maintain steady progress and complete their program within a reasonable timeframe.

* **SAT score of 1270 or higher**, or  
* **ACT composite score of 26 or higher**

This policy ensures academic maturity and post-secondary readiness for early graduates. Standardized test scores should be submitted directly to Excel High School and will become part of the student's **permanent academic record**.

Please contact the school office for assistance with graduation planning, transfer evaluations, or to determine which diploma track is the best fit for your educational and career goals.

6. # **Academic Success and Career Preparation**

## *Concurrent Enrollment Policy*

Excel High School maintains a clear policy regarding full-time enrollment to ensure academic integrity and compliance with accreditation standards.

**Students enrolled in Excel High School’s diploma program may not be concurrently enrolled in another full-time high school program.** This means a student must be enrolled in only one full-time high school at a time.

If a student is seeking to supplement their education while enrolled full-time at another institution, Excel offers **individual course enrollment options** for credit recovery, advancement, or enrichment. These courses may be taken on a part-time basis and are ideal for students who need specific credits without pursuing a full diploma through Excel.

Before enrolling, students and families should confirm their enrollment status and consult with the school registrar if they have any questions about full-time or part-time eligibility.

## *End-of-Course Survey*

At the conclusion of each course, all students are required to complete the **End-of-Course Survey**. This brief but important survey gathers feedback on a variety of key areas, including:

* Student engagement and course readiness  
* Support provided by Academic Coaches and Success Coaches  
* Ease of use and accessibility of technology  
* Curriculum quality and instructional resources  
* Overall learning experience and outcomes

The End-of-Course Survey serves as a vital tool in our **continuous improvement process**. Student feedback helps us identify strengths, address areas for enhancement, and ensure that Excel High School continues to provide a high-quality, student-centered learning experience.

Your input matters. By completing the survey thoughtfully, you play an active role in shaping the future of our programs and improving the experience for future students.

## *Standardized Testing*

Excel High School is an official **member of the College Board®**, and students who wish to take the **SAT**, **ACT**, or **Classical Learning Test (CLT)** may do so at a local authorized testing center. These standardized assessments are valuable for students preparing for college admissions and may also be required for students participating in state-funded education programs.

* **Excel High School’s CEEB Code is 240707**  
  Students should use this code when registering for standardized tests to ensure results are sent directly to Excel High School and included in the student's official academic record.

### *Requirements for Students Using State-Funded Programs, ESAs, or Vouchers*

If a student is enrolled in Excel High School through a **state-funded scholarship, education savings account (ESA), or school voucher**, additional **testing and reporting requirements** may apply. These programs often require submission of results from **nationally norm-referenced standardized assessments** as a condition for continued funding.

#### **Parent/Guardian Responsibilities:**

Each state or funding program has its own policies and timelines regarding:

Families are strongly encouraged to **review the specific guidelines of their state-funded program** to ensure full compliance and avoid interruptions in funding.

7. # **Academic Distinction and Enrichment Programs**

## *Academic Distinctions*

At \[EHS or NGA\], we are deeply committed to celebrating and nurturing the academic excellence of our students. Our academic honor system is thoughtfully crafted to recognize and reward outstanding performance, reflecting our dedication to each student's unique learning path. Through this system, we not only honor achievements but also inspire continued pursuit of knowledge and personal growth.

By creating an environment that values and rewards academic excellence, we endeavor to support every student in achieving their highest potential. We invite both parents and students to engage with us as we celebrate these significant milestones in our educational journey together.

### *Laude Latin Model*

At \[EHS or NGA\] we honor outstanding academic achievement by adopting the Laude Latin Model, a refined approach that goes beyond traditional class rankings. This model reflects our commitment to recognizing each student’s unique academic journey and their exceptional dedication to learning.

Your final cumulative grade point average (GPA) will determine the academic honor that is noted on your high school transcript, diploma, and celebrated at commencement. The three distinguished levels of academic honors are as follows:

* **Summa Cum Laude (With Highest Distinction):**  
  * Unweighted GPA (4.0 Scale): 4.000 and above  
  * Weighted Equivalent (4.5 Scale): Typically, a weighted GPA of 4.500 and above. This reflects the extra rigor and challenge of advanced courses.  
  * Weighted Equivalent (5.0 Scale): Typically, a weighted GPA of 5.000 and above. This reflects the highest academic achievement, incorporating the difficulty of advanced courses.  
* **Magna Cum Laude (With Great Distinction):**  
  * Unweighted GPA (4.0 Scale): 3.850 to 3.999  
  * Weighted Equivalent (4.5 Scale): Approximately 4.337 to 4.499. Taking more challenging courses could enhance a GPA within this range.  
  * Weighted Equivalent (5.0 Scale): Approximately 4.812 to 4.999. This range acknowledges significant achievement, considering the extra rigor of Honors, AP, or IB classes.  
* **Cum Laude (With Distinction):**  
  * Unweighted GPA (4.0 Scale): 3.667 to 3.849  
  * Weighted Equivalent (4.5 Scale): Roughly 4.150 to 4.336. The added weight reflects any advanced coursework, maintaining a high standard of achievement.  
  * Weighted Equivalent (5.0 Scale): Roughly 4.584 to 4.811. This reflects substantial academic dedication and success in more challenging coursework.

***Important Note:***

In instances where miscalculations are identified, adjustments will be made to award honors retrospectively. Honors that were mistakenly awarded will not be rescinded, ensuring fair and just recognition of your achievements.

At EHS, our goal is to celebrate and foster every student’s academic success. The Laude Latin model exemplifies our dedication to flexible and personalized learning paths, ensuring that each student's accomplishments are recognized in a meaningful and prestigious manner.

For additional guidance and support, please do not hesitate to reach out. Your academic journey is our top priority, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

## *Class Rank Position Statement*

Excel High School serves a diverse, global student body comprised of learners with varying academic histories, goals, and needs. Our students include high-achieving college-bound scholars, students re-engaging in education after interruption, and those seeking a flexible, self-paced path to graduation. Enrollment is open year-round to accommodate individual schedules and learning styles, creating a uniquely personalized academic environment.

In recognition of our growing partnerships with colleges and universities—many of which offer academic incentives, scholarships, or admissions benefits based on academic performance—Excel High School has adopted a **quartile-based class ranking system**.

Beginning with the Class of 2026, students will be ranked based on cumulative GPA and placed into the following quartiles:

* **Top 25% (First Quartile)**  
* **Second Quartile (Top 26–50%)**  
* **Third Quartile (Top 51–75%)**  
* **Fourth Quartile (Bottom 25%)**

This approach ensures fairness and comparability while maintaining the flexibility and inclusivity that define our program. Class rank by quartile will appear on official transcripts upon request and may be submitted to colleges, scholarship programs, and other institutions that require or consider class rank in their evaluations.

Students and families are encouraged to contact their **Success Coach** for guidance on how class rank, GPA, and academic achievements can impact college admissions and eligibility for university-partner incentives.

## *National Honor Society*

Beginning as early as high school sophomore year, students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher are eligible to apply for the National Honor Society. This prestigious organization recognizes students for their scholarship, leadership, character, and service.

## *Junior Honor Society*

We also proudly support the academic achievements of our middle school students through the Junior Honor Society. Eligible students, typically in 7th and 8th grade, who have demonstrated excellence in scholarship, leadership, character, citizenship, and service, are invited to apply. Being a member of the Junior Honor Society not only highlights our commitment to academic success but also nurtures future leaders and engaged citizens.

## *Honor Rolls*

Upon each milestone, we compile an official honor roll based on student GPA to celebrate academic excellence:

* **"Alpha" Honor Roll**:  
  * **Unweighted 4.0 Scale:**  
    * Term GPA: 3.667 and above  
    * This indicates a strong performance across standard coursework.  
  * **Weighted 4.5 Scale:**  
    * Approximate Term GPA: 4.125 and above  
    * Reflects additional recognition for engaging in higher-level courses such as Honors.  
  * **Weighted 5.0 Scale:**  
    * Approximate Term GPA: 4.584 and above  
    * Acknowledges excellence in advanced coursework, celebrating achievement in AP classes.

Virtual Clubs meet regularly and are facilitated by staff or student leaders in a safe, inclusive environment.

## *Student Community Achievement Hub*

The **Student Community Achievement Hub** is an online space where students come together to **celebrate wins, reflect on growth, and inspire one another** throughout their academic journey. Whether it's completing a course, hitting a personal milestone, or launching a creative project, every student achievement matters here.

**Vision:**  
We inspire students to build a better world through academic achievement and personal development.

* “What’s one goal you’ve set for next month, and how do you plan to achieve it?”

Students may respond in writing, images, or short videos to contribute to the hub, fostering a sense of connection and encouragement in our virtual community.

8. # **Inclusive Education and Support Systems**

Excel High School (EHS) is committed to providing a high-quality, flexible, and inclusive online education that supports the diverse needs of students, when possible, within the structure of our virtual learning environment. As a **non-public, tuition-funded school**, EHS does not receive state or federal funding (e.g., Title I, IDEA), and therefore is **not legally required to implement IEPs or 504 Plans**. However, we recognize the value of individualized support and are committed to doing what is feasible and educationally appropriate within our model.

#### **Discretionary Support for IEP Implementation**

EHS may, **at its discretion**, support the implementation of certain components of a student’s **existing IEP or 504 Plan**—\*\*as long as those accommodations are:

* Reasonably aligned with the self-paced, asynchronous format of our courses  
* Logistically feasible in a virtual setting  
* Do not require modifications to curriculum, assessment standards, or learning outcomes\*\*

Examples of accommodations that may be considered include:

* Extended time on assignments or assessments  
* Flexible scheduling or pacing support  
* Recorded instructional content  
* Assistive technology tools (e.g., text-to-speech, screen readers)  
* Adjusted assignment instructions or structure  
* Parent or learning coach support at home

EHS **does not provide** the following services:

* Modified or alternate curricula  
* One-on-one paraprofessional or in-person instructional support  
* Behavior intervention plans  
* Accommodations requiring fundamental changes to course structure or grading  
* Services that require state-certified special education personnel

### ***Disclosure and Documentation***

Families must disclose any diagnosed learning disabilities or support needs during the enrollment process. To be considered for discretionary support, parents/guardians must submit:

* The student’s most recent IEP, 504 Plan, or professional evaluation  
* Any formal accommodation documentation from a public or private school

Our team will review these materials and determine, in consultation with the parent, whether EHS is an appropriate fit and which supports may be offered.

### ***Making an Informed Enrollment Decision***

Because EHS is a **school of choice**, it is essential that families evaluate whether our asynchronous, college-prep curriculum represents the student’s **Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)**. We will always strive to support success—but we cannot guarantee full IEP or 504 compliance.

**State Compulsory Attendance Laws**

**Compulsory Attendance Laws:** Students under the age of 18 are responsible for complying with their state's compulsory attendance laws. These laws vary by state, and it is the responsibility of parents/guardians to ensure compliance with their local education regulations. Excel High School does not monitor or enforce state attendance requirements. Parents should consult their local school district or state education agency for guidance on meeting attendance obligations.

For students utilizing government-funded programs such as vouchers, daily participation is required per state compulsory attendance laws. Extended absences will be reported to the student's home district for appropriate action. Students must maintain regular engagement in coursework to remain in good standing.

**Attendance Records:** Excel High School operates as a self-paced, asynchronous online institution and does not maintain traditional attendance records like public schools. However, student progress is tracked through course activity and engagement. Parents or guardians seeking verification of student participation may request progress reports through the school.

**Status Letters and Transcripts:** Excel High School provides status letters and transcripts upon request, provided the student has official transcripts on file (if they attended a previous high school), has successfully completed at least one course, and is current on all tuition payments.

## *Participants: The Student*

At Excel High School, students play a central role in their academic success. As part of a flexible, self-paced learning environment, students are expected to take **ownership of their education** by being proactive, self-directed, and accountable. Our program is designed to cultivate independence and self-discipline—essential skills for both academic and lifelong success.

#### **Key Responsibilities of the Student**

**1\. Take Initiative**  
Students are expected to log in regularly, stay engaged with their courses, and complete all assignments with integrity and to the best of their ability.

**2\. Be Proactive in Seeking Support**  
If challenges arise, students should actively seek assistance from their **Academic Coaches, Success Coaches, or support staff**. Reaching out for help is encouraged and seen as a sign of commitment—not weakness.

**3\. Practice Strong Self-Management**  
Online learning requires students to manage their own time. This includes creating a consistent study schedule, setting realistic goals, and avoiding procrastination.

**4\. Meet Deadlines**  
While Excel offers flexibility, students must adhere to course expectations and assignment timelines. Completing work on time is critical to staying on track and maintaining momentum.

**5\. Monitor Progress Regularly**  
Progress reports and real-time performance data are available in **Learn Stage**, Excel High School’s Student Information System (SIS). Students are encouraged to log in frequently to review grades, track completion status, and make informed decisions about their learning strategies.

---

By embracing these responsibilities, students will not only succeed at Excel High School, but also build the academic discipline and self-motivation needed for college, career, and beyond.

## *Participants: The Parent/Guardian*

At Excel High School, parents and guardians play a vital role in the academic success and personal development of their student. While our program is designed to foster independence, students thrive when supported by an involved and attentive adult at home. We view parents as active partners in the educational process—especially in a flexible, asynchronous learning environment.

#### **Key Responsibilities of Parents and Guardians**

**1\. Provide a Supportive Learning Environment**  
Ensure your student has a dedicated, distraction-free space that is organized, well-lit, and equipped for online learning. A stable internet connection and consistent daily routine are essential for productivity and focus.

**2\. Offer Encouragement and Motivation**  
Stay engaged in your student’s learning by offering encouragement, helping with time management, and providing support as needed. Celebrate successes and help your student overcome challenges with resilience and positivity.

**3\. Monitor Academic Progress**  
Use the **Parent Portal in LearnStage** to track your student’s course activity, grades, assignment completion, and attendance patterns. Regular monitoring helps identify when additional support or coaching may be needed.

**4\. Communicate with Success Coaches**  
Parents are welcome—and encouraged—to request electronic progress updates from their student’s **Success Coach** at any point during the semester. These updates offer opportunities to:

* Ask questions and share concerns  
* Receive updates on academic progress and pacing  
* Collaborate on strategies to support student motivation and achievement

By actively participating in your student’s educational journey, you help create a strong foundation for success. Your involvement sends a powerful message that education is a priority, and your encouragement can make all the difference in a student's confidence, consistency, and overall performance.

## *The Crucial Role of Parental Involvement in Online Education*

As education continues to evolve, **online learning has emerged as a powerful alternative** to traditional classrooms—offering students flexibility, accessibility, and the opportunity to learn at their own pace. At Excel High School, we embrace an asynchronous model that empowers students to engage with their coursework when it best suits their individual needs and schedules. However, with this freedom comes a greater need for structure, accountability, and support—particularly from parents and guardians.

Parental involvement is a critical factor in helping students **develop academic independence** and take responsibility for their own learning. While the ultimate goal is for students to become self-directed and confident learners, parental support lays the foundation for that independence to take root and thrive.

### *1\. Creating a Structured Environment*

One of the most effective ways parents can support their student is by establishing a **structured and distraction-free learning environment** at home. This includes:

* Creating a dedicated workspace for study  
* Establishing a consistent daily routine  
* Ensuring reliable access to technology and internet  
* Limiting distractions during designated learning times

By creating a physical and emotional space that promotes focus and discipline, parents help students approach their online education with the seriousness and commitment it requires.

### *2\. Monitoring Progress and Staying Informed*

Parents do not need to become subject matter experts—but they do need to stay engaged. Monitoring your student’s academic progress through the **Parent Portal in LearnStage** is essential. Additional ways to remain involved include:

* Reviewing completed assignments and upcoming deadlines  
* Engaging in conversations about what your student is learning  
* Helping them access academic resources when needed  
* Understanding the support tools provided by Excel, including Success Coaches, Academic Coaches, and BRYTE AI Tutor

This engagement demonstrates that **education is a priority at home** and reinforces your student’s sense of accountability.

### *3\. Encouraging Engagement and Accountability*

Asynchronous learning places a premium on **time management and self-discipline**. Students must take initiative to complete their work, stay on pace, and meet course expectations—often without the daily physical presence of a teacher.

Parents play a vital role by:

* Setting clear expectations for school engagement  
* Encouraging students to maintain their weekly pacing  
* Following up on assignment completion and attendance  
* Reinforcing the importance of meeting deadlines

In short, parents help ensure students treat online school with the same commitment and structure as traditional schooling.

### *4\. Providing Emotional Support and Encouragement*

Beyond academics, online learners may face emotional and social challenges due to the independent nature of virtual education. Parents can provide much-needed support by:

* Being attuned to signs of stress, frustration, or disengagement  
* Encouraging positive outlets for social interaction  
* Offering motivation during difficult times and celebrating small wins  
* Modeling resilience and a growth mindset

Emotional support helps students build confidence, stay motivated, and understand that they are not alone in their journey.

### *5\. Understanding Your Responsibility*

Parents and guardians are responsible for ensuring that their student is:

* Attending school regularly (i.e., logging in and participating consistently)  
* Making academic progress in alignment with their diploma plan  
* Meeting any required deadlines, testing requirements, or reporting obligations—especially if enrolled under **state-funded programs or educational savings accounts (ESAs)**

Excel High School provides the tools and structure; families help reinforce them.

### *The Lasting Impact of Parental Involvement*

Decades of research confirm that **parental involvement is one of the strongest predictors of student success**. Engaged parents contribute to higher academic achievement, stronger self-esteem, better behavior, and increased motivation. Perhaps most importantly, when parents and schools work in partnership, students are more likely to develop the independence and confidence they need to thrive—not only in school, but in life.

As a parent or guardian, your role is more than supportive—it’s transformative. Together, we can ensure that online learning is not just an alternative to traditional education, but a dynamic pathway to **academic excellence, personal growth, and lifelong success**.

## *Excel High School Support Team and Coaches*

HF PAUSED HERE AS IT IS STARTING TO GET CONFUSING WITH REARRANGING UNTIL SUGGESTIONS ARE REVIEWED/ACCEPTED

**Awarding of Credits and Diplomas/ Grading and Reporting**

Excel High School is committed to upholding rigorous academic standards while providing flexibility through its online learning environment. Final grades are issued based on demonstrated mastery of course objectives, timely submission of coursework, and overall quality of performance. Course completion results in the awarding of **high school credits**, and accumulated credits contribute to diploma eligibility based on the selected graduation track.

Below is an overview of the grading scale and reporting terms used at Excel High School:

| A | Approximate average of 90-100% | Indicates exceptional mastery of course objectives. The student has consistently submitted high-quality work and met or exceeded expectations in a timely manner. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| B | Approximate average of 80-89% | Reflects a **strong understanding** of course material. Work is completed with care and competence, generally submitted on time. |
| C | Approximate average of 70-79% | Demonstrates an **acceptable grasp** of most course outcomes. Work meets minimum requirements and is completed within a reasonable timeframe. |
| D | Approximate average of 60-69% | Represents **limited understanding** of key concepts. While all major assignments were submitted, performance and comprehension were below average. |
| P | 60-100% | Issued for pass/fail courses. Indicates the student met the minimum requirements for course completion. **Does not impact GPA**. |
| F | Approximate average of below 59% | The student did not demonstrate sufficient mastery to earn credit. Coursework may be incomplete, submitted late, or consistently poor in quality. |
| IN | Incomplete | Indicates major coursework remains unsubmitted. Grade is withheld until missing assignments are completed. A temporary **F** is assigned until resolved. |
| W | Withdrawn | Assigned when a student officially withdraws within one month of last course activity. If no action is taken, a final **F** will be recorded after two months of inactivity. |

### ***Credit Awarding & Diploma Eligibility***

* High school credit is awarded upon **successful completion of coursework** with a passing grade (D or higher, or ‘Pass’ in pass/fail courses).  
* Students must complete the **minimum number of credits required** under their selected diploma track (Standard 21.5 credits, College Prep 24 credits, or Adult Program).  
* Final grades, GPA, and earned credits are recorded in the **Learn Stage Student Information System** and are reflected on official transcripts.  
* Credits from previously attended schools may be accepted upon review and in accordance with Excel’s **Transfer Credit Policy**.

Students and families are encouraged to stay informed by regularly reviewing grade reports in LearnStage. Questions about grading, credit recovery, or diploma eligibility should be directed to your Academic Coach or Success Coach.

### ***Credit Requirements for Graduation***

Excel High School offers two diploma pathways designed to meet the diverse academic goals of our students: the **Standard Diploma (21.5 credits)** and the more rigorous **Honors Diploma (24 credits)**. Both options are accredited, college-eligible programs that prepare students for post-secondary success.

High school–aged students may select either track based on their academic goals and future plans. Students planning to attend a four-year university or pursue competitive scholarships are encouraged to consider the Honors Diploma track.

**24 Credit Honors Diploma** 			**21.5 Credit Standard Diploma**

4.0 credits of English 				4.0 credits of English

4.0 credits of Math 					3.0 credits of Math

3.0 credits of Science 				3.0 credits of Science

Excel High School encourages all college-bound students to take advantage of test preparation opportunities to support their success in post-secondary admissions. Students should consider enrolling in **SAT, ACT, or Classical Learning Test (CLT)** prep courses during their **sophomore or junior year**, based on when they plan to sit for these exams.

Excel High School is a registered member of the **College Board®**, and students should use the official school code when registering for standardized tests:

📘 **Excel High School CEEB Code:** **240707**

#### **Accepted College Entrance Exams:**

* **SAT® (Scholastic Assessment Test)**  
* **ACT® (American College Testing)**  
* **CLT® (Classical Learning Test)** – A growing number of colleges and universities now accept CLT scores as part of their admissions criteria, particularly liberal arts and faith-based institutions.

Students may choose the exam that best aligns with their academic strengths and college application goals. Test preparation resources are available through **Peterson’s Career and Test Prep platform**, and additional support may be provided through the **ElevatED Climb or Summit programs**.

For questions about which test to take or how to prepare, students and families are encouraged to contact a **Success Coach** or the **school counseling office** for personalized guidance.

### ***Age-Based Graduation Policy***

As stated in Excel High School’s academic policies, any student who wishes to graduate before the age of 17 must meet additional standardized testing requirements.

* **Students under the age of 17** must submit official SAT or ACT scores before a diploma is issued, unless enrolled in an approved EHS partnership program.  
* These scores become part of the student’s **permanent academic record**.  
* **No diplomas will be issued to students under the age of 16\.**

Families are encouraged to contact their Success Coach with questions about graduation planning, testing, or diploma track selection.

### **GPA Weighting Policy**

### At EHS, we use a weighted GPA system to accurately reflect the rigor of each course type and recognize students who pursue more challenging academic pathways. Our standard grading scale is based on a 4.0 system; however, students enrolled in Honors or Advanced Placement (AP) courses earn additional GPA points to account for the increased difficulty of these courses. This weighted system supports a more comprehensive view of student achievement for college admissions and scholarship considerations*.*

![][image2]

### Final grades are converted to GPA points based on the letter grade earned and the level of the course. For example, an “A” in a standard course earns 4.0 points, while an “A” in an Honors course earns 4.5 points, and an “A” in an AP course earns 5.0 points. This system ensures that students are fairly recognized for pursuing advanced coursework while maintaining academic excellence.

### ***Credit Granting & Instructional Time Policy***

At Excel High School, academic credit is awarded based on **mastery of content**, **completion of instructional hours**, and **demonstrated performance** on key assessments. The following criteria govern how and when credit is issued for completed courses.

### ***Minimum Performance Requirements for Credit***

To earn credit for any standard Excel High School course, students must meet **all three** of the following benchmarks:

* **Final exam score** of **60% or higher**  
* **Each writing assignment** must receive a **minimum score of 60%** (equivalent to 12/20 or higher)  
* **Final course average** of **60% or higher**

🔹 **Note:** For **Advanced Placement (AP)** and **University of California A-G (AG-CA)** approved courses, a **minimum of 70%** is required on the final exam and overall course grade to be eligible for credit.

### ***Instructional Time and Credit Equivalency***

Credit is awarded based on the completion of instructional time aligned with standard academic expectations:

| Course Type | Instructional Time | Credit Granted |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard Semester Course | 90–110 hours | 1.0 semester credit |
| Half-Semester Course | 45–55 hours | 0.5 semester credit |
| Honors Course | 55–100 hours | 0.5 semester credit |

### ***Diploma Credit Residency Requirement***

To maintain the integrity of the Excel High School diploma, students must complete **at least 25% of their required graduation credits** through Excel. This equates to a minimum of **6 full courses (or 3 credits)** completed directly within our program. Transfer credits will be evaluated in accordance with Excel’s **Transfer Credit Policy**.

# **Final Exam Access Policy**

To ensure sufficient instructional engagement:

* For **high school–aged students**, **final exams are locked until a minimum of 60 days** from the date of course enrollment.  
* For **adult learners**, final exams are **unlocked by default** and may be taken at any time upon course completion.

Students and families are encouraged to review course pacing guidelines and work closely with their **Academic Coach** or **Success Coach** to ensure steady progress and credit eligibility. For more information, please contact the Registrar’s Office or submit a Help Desk Ticket via LearnStage.

**California A–G (CA-AG) Program Requirements**

The University of California (UC) system requires students to complete a defined sequence of 15 yearlong high school courses across core academic subjects such as history/social science, English, mathematics, laboratory science, world language, visual and performing arts, and college-preparatory electives. To be eligible for admission, students must earn a grade of 70% or better in each course, with at least 11 of the 15 completed by the end of their junior year.

Excel High School’s CA-AG Program aligns students’ academic plans with UC requirements by automatically enrolling them in A–G approved courses. Students in the CA-AG Program will be placed on the alternate 24-credit diploma track, which includes additional recommended coursework in mathematics, laboratory science, and world language to enhance UC eligibility and overall college readiness. If a student chooses not to pursue the full 24-credit diploma, they must formally opt out by contacting the school to be placed on the standard 21.5-credit diploma track.This opt-out process allows for academic advising to ensure students and families understand the implications of selecting a reduced credit pathway, especially as it may relate to UC college admissions. 

### ***NCAA Eligibility***

📘 **2025–2026 Status Update:**  
Excel High School is currently in the process of applying for **NCAA approval**. At this time, Excel courses **do not yet fulfill NCAA Division I or II academic eligibility requirements**, but the school is actively working toward approval.

### ***What NCAA Requires***

The NCAA does **not require live (synchronous) instruction** for nontraditional (online) courses. However, it does require that courses include:

* **Ongoing, teacher-initiated interaction**  
* **Regular, individualized feedback** on student work  
* Instruction by a **qualified educator**  
* **Defined start and end dates**  
* A pace that reflects traditional academic engagement—not overly accelerated

* **Teacher-initiated academic interaction** through consistent grading, feedback, and proactive communication from Academic Coaches  
* **Six checkpoint meetings per semester** with a **dedicated Success Coach** to ensure students remain on track academically and athletically

### ***Behavior Expectations***

At Excel High School, students are expected to uphold the highest standards of conduct in all academic and digital environments. As members of a global online learning community, students must demonstrate **respect, integrity, and responsibility** in their communication, coursework, and interactions with peers and staff.

Any behavior that—**in the judgment of school staff or administration**—negatively impacts the learning environment, violates school policies, or disrupts the operations of the school may result in disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include but are not limited to:

* Plagiarism or academic dishonesty  
* Harassment, bullying, or inappropriate language  
* Repeated breaches of netiquette (online etiquette)  
* Violation of the Acceptable Use Policy (e.g., misuse of digital platforms or resources)  
* Disrespectful or disruptive communication with staff or peers

### ***Progressive Discipline Policy***

Excel High School follows a **progressive discipline model**, which provides opportunities for correction, support, and accountability while addressing inappropriate behavior. The process is designed to be fair and responsive. **Depending on the severity of the behavior, steps may be accelerated or skipped.**

| Step | Example Trigger Behavior | Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Step 1 | Occasional or minor breaches of netiquette that slightly disrupt the learning environment (e.g., casual inappropriate tone in forums or emails). | The student receives a direct communication from their Coach or Advisor to address the behavior and reinforce expectations. |
| Step 2 | Continued or more frequent breaches of netiquette that begin to affect the learning community. | Communication is escalated to include the student, parent/guardian, Coach/Advisor, and the President. Behavior expectations are clarified, and documentation is recorded. |
| Step 3 | A moderate violation of the Acceptable Use Policy that does not impact other students or school operations (e.g., inappropriate search behavior, misuse of course platforms). | The student, parent/guardian, Coach, Advisor, and President are engaged in a formal meeting. The student may be placed on **behavioral probation**, with conditions clearly defined. Future violations may lead to suspension or dismissal. Terms are established in consultation with the Director. |
| Step 4 | A serious violation such as **plagiarism, harassment, or a significant Acceptable Use Policy breach** that harms another student or undermines the academic integrity or operations of the school. | A formal review is conducted involving the student, parent/guardian, President, Coach, Advisor, and other relevant staff. Disciplinary outcomes may include **probation, removal from a course, or expulsion** from the school. In cases of severe or egregious misconduct, **immediate expulsion without a prior conference** may occur. |

### ***Excel High School Netiquette Guidelines***

1. **Use Standard Written English (When Appropriate)**  
   In most courses, students should use **standard written English** in discussion posts, messages, and assignments. Slang and informal language are generally discouraged in academic environments. Exceptions may apply in casual chat or discussion threads and foreign language classes.  
2. **Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS**  
   In online communication, **ALL CAPS** is considered shouting. Use capital letters only for emphasis and proper grammar.  
3. **Post with Purpose**  
   Course discussions are part of your academic record. Strive to write messages that demonstrate **clear, critical, and analytical thinking**. Avoid vague responses like “I agree” or “Good point.” Instead, explain *why* you agree or add meaningful context to move the conversation forward.  
4. **Engage Respectfully**  
   Healthy debate is encouraged, but disrespect is not. When you disagree with a peer or instructor, do so politely and constructively. For example, instead of saying, *“That makes no sense,”* try, *“I see it differently—could you explain your perspective a bit more?”*  
5. **Be Patient and Supportive**  
   Your classmates may be at different levels of writing or technical skill. Be kind when offering corrections or feedback, and extend grace when mistakes happen—yours included.  
6. **Let Your Personality Shine**  
   Online learning doesn’t mean you have to sound robotic. Use your authentic voice while remaining respectful and on-topic. Humor and creativity are welcome when used appropriately.  
7. **No Profanity or Offensive Language**  
   **Profanity, crude language, or hate speech of any kind is strictly prohibited.** Any use of vulgar, grotesque, or discriminatory language—whether written or spoken—will result in disciplinary action and may lead to immediate dismissal from Excel High School.

### ***Reminder***

Every message you write—whether in a course discussion, help desk ticket, email, or chat—is a reflection of your professionalism and character. We encourage all students to communicate as though speaking in person, with courtesy, maturity, and academic integrity.

If you have questions about appropriate communication or behavior online, please contact your **Academic Coach** or **Success Coach** for guidance.

### ***School Policies and Expectations***

At Excel High School, we are committed to fostering a learning environment that is **safe, respectful, secure, and academically honest** for all members of our school community.

This pledge signifies a shared commitment to the standards that make online learning effective, inclusive, and safe.

### ***Policy Enforcement and Grounds for Dismissal***

apply regarding drop, transfer, incomplete, and failing grade rules. However, if a single  
course student requests to drop within the first 10 days of availability, no grade or  
completion status will be recorded on the transcript. In this case, the course will be  
deleted entirely from the student’s academic record.

**Semester Courses (0.5 Credit):** Incomplete grades are not permitted for semester  
courses. Any semester course with unfinished assignments by the deadline will be  
recorded as a failed course.

#### **Course Load Policy**

* **Full Program Students:** May be enrolled in up to six (6) courses at a time.  
* **Single Course/Credit Recovery Students:** May be enrolled in up to three (3) courses at a time.  
* Students may take only one core course per subject area concurrently. *For example, English 11 must be completed before enrolling in English 12\.*

For questions about academic integrity, writing expectations, AI policy, or academic planning, please contact your **Academic Coach**, **Success Coach**, or a school administrator. We are here to help you succeed \- ethically and confidently.

**Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99\) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31).

• School officials with legitimate educational interest;

• Other schools to which a student is transferring;

• Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;

• Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;

• Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;

• Accrediting organizations;

• To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena;

• Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and

• State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.
