Note one action you'll take this week to practice it.**\n\nFor example:\n- *\"I'm least comfortable with spreadsheets. This week, I'll create a simple budget spreadsheet to track my expenses.\"*\n- *\"I struggle with organizing files effectively. I'll create a folder system for my coursework and practice saving files with clear naming conventions.\"*\n- *\"Email communication feels challenging. I'll draft three practice emails using proper formatting and etiquette.\"*\n\nTake a few minutes to write down your response. This personal commitment to skill development will help you identify and address any potential gaps before they impact your coursework. Remember, these fundamental digital skills will be essential across all your courses at Excel High School, and strengthening them now will set you up for success.\n\nIf you identified a skill gap, consider spending 15-30 minutes each day this week practicing that specific skill. Small, consistent practice sessions are often more effective than a single long session.\n</educational_content>"}
