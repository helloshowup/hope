Let's walk through what happens from the moment you sign up, with special attention to refund deadlines that might affect your finances.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Your Enrolment Timeline Visualised\n\nYour journey at Excel High School follows this straightforward timeline:\n\n```\nDay 0 → Day 1 → Day 10\nEnrolment    Course    End of Refund\nDate         Activation    Period\n```\n\n**Day 0: Enrolment Date**\nThis is when you officially join Excel High School. You complete your registration and sort out payment (either paying in full or choosing a payment plan). Think of this as day zero of your Excel journey.\n\n**Day 1: Course Activation**\nJust one day after you enrol, your course becomes fully accessible. You can immediately dive into all your course materials, lessons, and assignments through your student portal. No waiting around - you can begin learning straight away!\n\n**Day 10: End of Refund Period**\nThe first 10 days after enrolment give you time to decide if Excel High School works for you. During this window, you can explore your courses and request a refund if you find the programme doesn't suit your needs.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Understanding the Refund Period\n\nThe 10-day refund period gives you breathing room while you check out your courses. Here's what you should know:\n\n**What the Refund Period Covers:**\n- It starts on your enrolment date (Day 0) and continues through Day 10\n- You'll have complete access to all course materials during this time\n- You can browse content, try assignments, and test-drive the learning platform\n- If Excel doesn't feel right for you, you can request a refund according to the policy\n\n**Important Refund Details:**\n- Submit any refund requests before Day 10 ends\n- A 3% processing fee applies to all refunds\n- After Day 10, refunds aren't available (with some exceptions for state-funded programmes)\n- The same 10-day window applies whether you paid in full or chose a payment plan\n\nThis period lets you make an informed choice about your educational investment without getting locked in too quickly.\n\n## Core Concept 3: Making the Most of Your First 10 Days\n\nHere's a practical plan for your first 10 days at Excel High School:\n\n**Days 1-3: Orientation and Exploration**\n- Finish the orientation course\n- Get familiar with your student portal and where everything lives\n- Read through your course syllabi to understand what's expected\n- Test key features like submitting assignments or messaging teachers\n\n**Days 4-7: Active Engagement**\n- Start working on your first assignments to get a feel for the course format\n- Contact your teachers with any questions about the material\n- Think about how the coursework fits with your learning style and schedule\n- Spot any potential challenges with the course structure\n\n**Days 8-10: Decision and Planning**\n- Decide whether you'll continue with Excel\n- If staying, map out a study schedule for your courses\n- If considering withdrawal, contact Student Services before your Day 10 deadline\n- Set some personal goals for your learning journey\n\nThis approach helps you thoroughly understand what Excel High School offers before your refund period expires.\n\n## Over to You:\n1. How will you organise your first 10 days at Excel High School to properly evaluate your courses?\n2. What specific aspects of your courses matter most to you during the refund period?\n3. How might understanding this timeline help you better manage your educational experience?\n\n## Test Your Understanding\n\n1. When does your course activate after enrolment?\n   - A.
