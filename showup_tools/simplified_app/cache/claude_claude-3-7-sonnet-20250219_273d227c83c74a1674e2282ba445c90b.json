Sentences are shorter and more direct than in the original versions.\n\n2. **Added the missing \"What Your Tuition Covers\" section**: This was mentioned in the context but missing from all three versions. I created this section highlighting the six credits per grade level, 24/7 LMS access, and Success Coach support.\n\n3. **Improved readability**: I used bullet points for lists and kept paragraphs short to enhance readability for online learning.\n\n4. **Personalized tone**: I used \"you\" language to directly address the student, making the content more engaging and relevant.\n\n5. **Focused information**: I removed excessive details that might overwhelm teenage learners while maintaining all essential information about tuition and fees.\n\n6. **Clear organization**: The content follows a logical flow from introduction to summary, with clear section headings that help students navigate the information.\n\nThis version best serves the target learners by providing clear, relevant information about tuition in an accessible format that supports self-paced, asynchronous learning.
