Each program has different tuition costs that will automatically populate in the calculator.\n\n2. **Enter Your Start Date**: Using the calendar feature, select when you plan to start your courses. This date serves as the anchor for your payment schedule.\n\nOnce you've entered this information, the calculator will automatically generate:\n\n- A monthly payment schedule showing due dates and payment amounts\n- The total program cost including any applicable fees\n- A breakdown of how your payments are applied to tuition and fees\n\nThe calculator uses a color-coded system to help you visualize your payment timeline - upcoming payments appear in blue, paid payments in green, and any missed payments would appear in red.\n\n### Exploring Different Payment Scenarios\n\nUnderstanding how changes to your payment schedule might affect your budget is an important part of financial planning.
