This lesson will familiarize you with major U.S. holidays, their observance dates, and how they affect school closures. By mastering this information, you'll be better equipped to manage your study schedule and stay on track with your coursework throughout the year. Let's explore the holiday calendar and learn how to navigate school closures while maintaining access to your educational materials.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Major U.S. Holidays and Observance Dates\n\nThe United States observes several national holidays throughout the year. Here's a list of major holidays from New Year's Day to Christmas:\n\n1. New Year's Day - January 1\n2. Martin Luther King Jr. Day - Third Monday in January\n3. Presidents' Day - Third Monday in February\n4. Memorial Day - Last Monday in May\n5. Independence Day - July 4\n6. Labor Day - First Monday in September\n7. Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples' Day - Second Monday in October\n8. Veterans Day - November 11\n9. Thanksgiving Day - Fourth Thursday in November\n10. Christmas Day - December 25\n\nIt's important to note that while these are federal holidays, not all schools or businesses observe every holiday on this list. Excel High School's specific closure dates may vary, so always refer to the official school calendar for the most accurate information.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Weekend Holiday Observances Shifting to Weekdays\n\nWhen a holiday falls on a weekend, it's common practice for schools and businesses to observe it on the nearest weekday. This ensures that students and employees can enjoy the holiday without losing a day off. Here's how the shift typically works:\n\n- If a holiday falls on a Saturday, it is usually observed on the preceding Friday.\n- If a holiday falls on a Sunday, it is usually observed on the following Monday.\n\nFor example, if Independence Day (July 4) falls on a Saturday, Excel High School might observe it on Friday, July 3. Similarly, if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the school might be closed on Monday, January 2.\n\nThis practice helps maintain a consistent schedule and ensures that students don't miss out on holiday observances due to weekend dates. Always check the school's official calendar for specific observance dates, as they may vary from year to year.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Coursework Accessibility During School Closures\n\nAn important aspect of Excel High School's online learning environment is that your coursework remains accessible even during school closures. While the school may be officially closed for a holiday, you can still:\n\n- Log in to your student portal\n- Access course materials and assignments\n- Submit completed work\n- Engage with pre-recorded lessons or resources\n\nThis continuous access allows you to maintain your study schedule if you choose to work during holidays. However, it's important to balance your studies with proper rest and celebration of these important cultural observances.\n\nRemember that while coursework is accessible, school staff and teachers may not be available for immediate assistance during official closures. Plan accordingly by addressing any urgent questions or concerns before the holiday break.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. How might knowing the holiday schedule in advance help you plan your coursework more effectively?\n2. Consider a situation where a major assignment is due right after a holiday. How would you use the continuous access to coursework to manage this deadline?\n3. Reflect on the importance of balancing study time with holiday observances. How can you create a schedule that respects both your academic goals and cultural celebrations?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1.
