Consistency is key in online learning, so aim for daily engagement, even if it's just for a short session.\n\n3. Completion Targets: For each course, establish weekly completion goals. This might be finishing a certain number of lessons, completing a module, or submitting an assignment. Be realistic but ambitious.\n\n4.

SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Here's how to apply this framework to your Excel High School courses:\n\nSpecific: Clearly define what you want to accomplish in each course this week. Instead of \"study biology,\" try \"complete Module 3 in Biology, including all quizzes.\"\n\nMeasurable: Quantify your goals so you can track progress. For example, \"read 30 pages of the English literature text\" or \"score 85% or higher on the Algebra practice test.\"\n\nAchievable: Set challenging but realistic goals based on your course load and personal circumstances. Consider your past performance and available study time.\n\nRelevant: Ensure your weekly goals align with the overall course objectives and your long-term academic aspirations.\n\nTime-bound: Assign specific deadlines to your goals. This might be \"by Friday evening\" or \"before my Tuesday study session.\"\n\nIn your planner, include a SMART goal for each course. For example:\n- World History: Complete all readings and discussion posts for Unit 4 by Thursday, aiming for substantive responses that incorporate at least two primary sources.\n- Chemistry: Solve 20 practice problems from Chapter 5 with 90% accuracy by Saturday, focusing on balancing chemical equations.\n\nRegularly review and adjust your SMART goals based on your progress and any changes in course requirements or personal circumstances.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Success Coach Check-ins and Resource Identification (250 words)\n\nYour Excel High School Success Coach is a valuable resource for academic support and guidance. To ensure you're making the most of this relationship:\n\n1. Schedule Monthly Check-ins: In your planner, include a checkbox to remind you to schedule your monthly Success Coach meeting. These regular check-ins help you stay accountable and provide an opportunity to discuss your progress, challenges, and goals.\n\n2. Prepare for Check-ins: Before each meeting, review your planner and identify specific topics you want to discuss. This might include course selection, study strategies, or career planning.\n\n3. Identify Challenges: In your weekly planner, include a section to note your top two academic challenges. These might be time management issues, difficulty with specific course content, or technical problems.\n\n4. Link to Resources: For each challenge you identify, research and note relevant resources. Excel High School offers various support options:\n   - Tutorial videos in the student portal\n   - Subject-specific study guides\n   - Peer tutoring services\n   - Technical support helpdesk\n\nBy proactively identifying challenges and linking them to resources, you're taking an active role in your learning journey.
