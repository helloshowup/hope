This lesson covers what you need to know about the SAT, ACT, and CLT tests, plus how your feedback through surveys helps shape your education. Getting these details right now will save you headaches later—whether you're aiming for university or meeting state requirements.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Overview of SAT, ACT, CLT and Using the School CEEB Code\n\nThe SAT, ACT, and CLT are standardised tests widely used for college admissions in the United States. Each test assesses different skills:\n\n- **SAT:** Focuses on evidence-based reading, writing, and maths. It evaluates your college readiness and problem-solving abilities.\n- **ACT:** Covers English, maths, reading, and science reasoning. It also includes an optional writing section.\n- **CLT (Classic Learning Test):** Emphasises classical education, testing verbal reasoning, grammar, and quantitative reasoning.\n\nWhen registering for these tests, you'll need to use Excel High School's unique CEEB (College Entrance Examination Board) code. This code ensures your test scores are sent directly to our school. Excel High School's CEEB code is: 240044. Double-check this code when registering—a simple typo can cause weeks of delays in receiving your scores.\n\nKey points to remember:\n- Research which test(s) your target colleges prefer\n- Register early to secure your preferred test date and location\n- Use Excel High School's CEEB code (240044) during registration\n- Prepare thoroughly using official study materials and practise tests\n\n### Core Concept 2: Special Rules for State-Funded Students\n\nIf you're a state-funded student at Excel High School, you'll have some additional testing requirements:\n\n1. **Mandatory State Assessments:** Some states require specific standardised tests for accountability purposes. These may include end-of-course exams or comprehensive assessments.\n\n2. **Testing Windows:** State-funded students often must complete required tests within specific time frames. Missing these windows can impact your funding or graduation eligibility.\n\n3. **Score Reporting:** You may need to submit scores from state-mandated tests directly to both Excel High School and your state's education department.\n\n4. **Additional Prep Resources:** Many states provide free test preparation materials for required assessments. Take advantage of these resources to boost your performance.\n\nNot sure what your state requires? Your Excel High School advisor can provide you with the most up-to-date information and deadlines for your particular situation.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Purpose and Structure of the End-of-Course Survey\n\nThe End-of-Course Survey helps improve your educational experience at Excel High School. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**Purpose:**\n- Gather student feedback on course content, instruction, and overall experience\n- Identify areas for improvement in curriculum and teaching methods\n- Ensure the quality and relevance of Excel High School's programmes\n\n**Structure:**\n- Multiple-choice questions rating various aspects of the course\n- Open-ended questions for more detailed feedback\n- Usually takes 10-15 minutes to complete\n\nYou'll find the survey available in the last week of each course. Your honest feedback really does make a difference—previous student suggestions have led to actual changes in how courses are delivered.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. How might your choice between the SAT, ACT, or CLT impact your college application strategy? Consider your personal strengths and target schools.\n\n2. Why do you think state-funded students have additional testing requirements? What are the potential benefits and challenges?\n\n3. How could your thoughtful participation in End-of-Course Surveys contribute to improving the learning experience for future Excel High School students?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1.
