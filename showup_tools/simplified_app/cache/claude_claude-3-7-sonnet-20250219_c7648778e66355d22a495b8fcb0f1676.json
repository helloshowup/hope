Our approach to providing accommodations is unique because we're a non-public, tuition-funded school. This lesson will clarify what support services we can offer online, what limitations exist, and how our self-paced model might actually benefit your learning style.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Excel High School's Discretionary Support Policy\n\nExcel High School aims to create an inclusive learning environment where all students can succeed. Our discretionary support policy means we look at accommodation requests individually rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach. Here's what this means for you:\n\n- **Non-public school status**: As a tuition-funded school, Excel High School isn't bound by the same legal requirements as public schools regarding special education services. We don't receive government funding for special education programmes.\n\n- **Individual assessment**: We evaluate each student's needs on their own merits to determine what accommodations make sense within our online platform.\n\n- **Balanced approach**: We aim to support you while maintaining the integrity of our curriculum and preparing you for future academic and career success.\n\n- **Communication**: Open conversation between students, families, and our staff is key for finding effective support strategies that work for you.\n\nThis flexible approach helps many students with diverse learning needs thrive in our online environment, even though we can't implement every accommodation that might be available in a traditional school.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Examples of Accommodations Considered\n\nEvery student's situation is unique, but here are some accommodations that Excel High School may be able to provide:\n\n1. **Extended time**: We can adjust assignment deadlines and provide extra time on tests when appropriate.\n\n2. **Flexible pacing**: Our self-paced model naturally allows you to spend more time on challenging concepts and move quickly through material you find easier.\n\n3. **Alternative formats**: In some cases, we can offer different ways to show your knowledge, such as written responses instead of multiple-choice questions.\n\n4. **Text-to-speech technology**: We can enable or recommend compatible tools that read digital text aloud.\n\n5. **Simplified instructions**: Teachers can provide clearer, more concise directions for assignments when needed.\n\n6. **Visual supports**: Additional diagrams, charts, or other visual elements can help support different learning styles.\n\n7. **Reduced distractions**: The online environment naturally eliminates many classroom distractions, and you can further customise your learning space at home.\n\nRemember that these accommodations are considered individually and must work within our online learning platform. We encourage you to discuss your specific needs with our support team to see what might work best for you.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Services Not Offered and Learning Model\n\nWhile we try to be accommodating, there are certain services we simply cannot provide due to the nature of online education:\n\n**Services not available at Excel High School include:**\n\n1. In-person paraprofessionals or one-on-one aides\n2. Physical, occupational, or speech therapy\n3. Significant curriculum modifications that alter course learning objectives\n4. Real-time, synchronous instruction on demand\n5. Specialised equipment or assistive technology beyond what's available through standard computers\n\n**Our Learning Model and Least Restrictive Environment**\n\nExcel High School operates on a self-paced, asynchronous learning model. What does this mean for you? You can:\n- Work through course materials at your own pace\n- Access lessons and assignments when it works best for you\n- Take breaks as needed without disrupting others\n- Review material multiple times until you understand it\n\nFor many students, this model actually aligns well with the concept of Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). LRE refers to an educational setting that provides appropriate support while maximising a student's ability to learn alongside peers. The online environment can be less restrictive than a traditional classroom because it:\n\n- Reduces social pressures and anxiety\n- Eliminates distractions from other students\n- Allows you to learn in a comfortable, familiar setting\n- Gives you control over your learning pace and schedule\n\nMany students find that these features of online learning help them succeed academically, even without the full range of services that might be available in a traditional school setting.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your own learning preferences. Which aspects of Excel High School's self-paced, online model might be most beneficial for you? Are there any challenges you anticipate?\n\n2. What types of accommodations, if any, do you think would help you succeed in your online courses at Excel High School?\n\n3. Consider how the flexibility of online learning might create a less restrictive environment for different types of learners. What advantages might this offer compared to a traditional classroom?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following best describes Excel High School's approach to accommodations?\n   A. Excel High School implements all accommodations listed in IEPs and 504 Plans\n   B. Excel High School considers accommodations on a case-by-case basis\n   C. Excel High School does not provide any accommodations\n   D. Excel High School only provides accommodations required by federal law\n\n2. Which service is NOT offered by Excel High School?\n   A. Extended time on assignments\n   B. Flexible pacing\n   C. In-person paraprofessional support\n   D. Text-to-speech technology\n\n3. How does Excel High School's self-paced model align with Least Restrictive Environment considerations?\n   A. It doesn't align with LRE at all\n   B. It allows students to learn at their own pace in a comfortable setting\n   C. It requires all students to follow the same schedule\n   D. It provides the exact same environment as a traditional classroom\n\n### Summary\n\nThis lesson explored Excel High School's approach to supporting students with diverse learning needs. The discretionary support policy allows us to consider accommodations individually, including extended time, flexible pacing, and alternative assignment formats. Some services cannot be provided, such as in-person support or significant curriculum modifications. \n\nThe self-paced, asynchronous nature of the programme creates a learning environment that may actually be less restrictive for many students, allowing for individualised pacing and reduced distractions. Understanding these policies helps you set realistic expectations and make informed decisions about your education at Excel High School.\n\nThe next lesson will explore the specific process for requesting accommodations and submitting documentation to support your learning needs.\n</edited_text>"}
