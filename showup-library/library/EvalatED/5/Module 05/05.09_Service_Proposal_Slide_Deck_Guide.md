# 5.9 Service Proposal Slide Deck Guide

What if you had just five slides to secure support for a community-changing project? Behind every successful volunteer initiative lies a compelling proposal that captures both hearts and minds. This guide equips you with the blueprint for a concise 5-slide presentation that transforms your service vision into a structured plan of action, demonstrating your grasp of volunteer principles while showcasing your communication skills and strategic thinking.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Create a 5-slide service proposal presentation that conveys a community need and action plan
- Organize project information using the recommended slide structure and content requirements
- Apply professional design principles to enhance the visual impact and readability of your presentation

## Core Elements of Your Service Proposal Slide Deck

### Slide 1: Title and Team Introduction

Your first slide should include:

- A compelling title for your service project
- Team member names and roles
- A single striking image representing your cause
- Date of proposal

**Pro Tip:** Keep your title concise but descriptive (7-10 words maximum).

### Slide 2: Community Need Assessment

This slide should convey:

- The specific community need or problem identified
- Supporting evidence (statistics, testimonials, observations)
- Why addressing this need matters
- Who will benefit from your service

**Example:** Instead of "Helping the homeless," specify "Addressing winter clothing shortages for 200+ unhoused residents in downtown Phoenix."

### Slide 3: Service Plan Overview

Present your solution with:

- Clear objectives (what you aim to accomplish)
- Timeline of activities with specific dates
- Required resources and materials (be specific about quantities and costs)
- Expected outcomes and how you'll track results

**Checkpoint:** Are your objectives SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)?

### Slide 4: Leadership Structure

Detail your team organization:

- Organizational chart showing team hierarchy
- Specific responsibilities for each team member
- Communication protocols between team members
- Decision-making process

**Interactive Element:** Consider including a QR code linking to team member bios or additional project details.

### Slide 5: Implementation and Follow-up

Conclude with:

- Key milestones and checkpoints
- Potential challenges and contingency plans
- Sustainability considerations (how impact continues)
- Contact information for questions

**Reflection Question:** How will you know if your service project was successful?

## Design Tips

The visual presentation of your slide deck matters just as much as the content. A well-designed presentation boosts understanding and engagement, while poor design can distract from your message. These design principles will help your service proposal connect with diverse audiences in various viewing environments.

- Use consistent fonts (1-2 maximum) and a color scheme (3-4 colors) throughout
- Include relevant images that enhance understanding
- Keep text concise (5-7 bullet points per slide with 5-7 words per bullet)
- Make all text at least 24pt font size for readability
- Balance text with visual elements on each slide
- Use high-contrast colors for better accessibility

## Submission Checklist

Before finalizing your presentation, review your work thoroughly. This quality check helps your proposal make a strong impression and convey your service plan. The checklist below covers both technical requirements and content considerations to help you submit a polished presentation that shows your commitment to the project.
