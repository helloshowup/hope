    <h1 style="color: #920205;">5.7 Decision Matrix Demonstration</h1>
<p>Evaluating multiple opportunities or options can quickly become overwhelming due to competing factors. How do we make a systematic decision when faced with several choices? A decision matrix provides a structured approach to compare alternatives based on specific criteria. Today, we'll work through a practical example together, comparing three organizations based on two critical dimensions: fit and feasibility. This analytical tool will help you move beyond gut feelings to make data-informed decisions in both academic and professional contexts.</p>
<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Construct a decision matrix to evaluate multiple options based on weighted criteria</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Calculate weighted scores to determine the optimal choice among competing alternatives</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Apply this decision-making method to solve real-world problems requiring complex trade-offs</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Decision Matrix</h2>
<p>A decision matrix functions as an effective analytical tool that transforms subjective preferences into quantifiable data points. This structured approach allows for methodical comparison across multiple options, helping to minimize bias and clarify thinking. The matrix excels in situations where decisions involve numerous factors that need balancing, offering a visual representation of complex trade-offs that might otherwise be difficult to grasp.</p>
<ol>
<li>List all available options (in our case, three organizations)</li>
<li>Identify key evaluation criteria (fit and feasibility)</li>
<li>Assign weights to these criteria based on importance</li>
<li>Score each option against each criterion</li>
<li>Calculate weighted scores to determine the best overall choice</li>
</ol>
<p>For our demonstration, we'll focus on evaluating three potential partner organizations for a community service project. Our primary criteria will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fit</strong>: How well the organization's mission aligns with our project goals</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility</strong>: How practical it would be to work with this organization (considering resources, timing, accessibility)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Our Decision Matrix</h2>
<p>The process of building a decision matrix requires thoughtful consideration at each step. By assigning numerical values to our preferences and constraints, the matrix transforms qualitative judgments into a quantitative analysis. This approach is especially valuable when working with teams or stakeholders who may have different perspectives, as it creates a common language for evaluation and helps surface assumptions that might otherwise remain hidden.</p>
<p>First, we need to determine the relative importance of our criteria. For this project, let's say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fit = 60% importance (weight of 0.6)</li>
<li>Feasibility = 40% importance (weight of 0.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we'll score each organization on a scale of 1-10 for each criterion:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Organization</th>
<th>Fit (0.6)</th>
<th>Feasibility (0.4)</th>
<th>Weighted Score</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Organization A</td>

</tbody>

<h2>Completing the Matrix Together</h2>
<p>Let's examine each organization in detail to assign appropriate scores based on our established criteria. This evaluation process requires careful consideration of both objective factors and more nuanced elements that might affect the partnership. By working through each option step by step, we can uncover patterns that might not be obvious when looking at choices as a whole or based on first impressions.</p>
<p><strong>Organization A: Local Food Bank</strong>
- Fit: They focus on hunger issues, which partially aligns with our goal of community wellness. Let's score this a 7.
- Feasibility: They have flexible volunteer hours and are located near campus. Score: 9</p>
<p><strong>Organization B: Environmental Cleanup Initiative</strong>
- Fit: Their mission of environmental stewardship aligns perfectly with our sustainability focus. Score: 9
- Feasibility: They require specialized training and weekend-only participation. Score: 5</p>
<p><strong>Organization C: Youth Mentorship Program</strong>
- Fit: Their educational focus somewhat aligns with our goals. Score: 6
- Feasibility: They have multiple locations but limited hours. Score: 7</p>
<p>Now, let's calculate the weighted scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization A: (7 × 0.6) + (9 × 0.4) = 4.2 + 3.6 = 7.8</li>
<li>Organization B: (9 × 0.6) + (5 × 0.4) = 5.4 + 2.0 = 7.4</li>
<li>Organization C: (6 × 0.6) + (7 × 0.4) = 3.6 + 2.8 = 6.4</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bias Check Notes:</strong>
- Watched for halo effect (Project Beta scoring high on all criteria due to strong strategic alignment)
- Considered sunk cost fallacy (avoided favoring Project Alpha despite previous investments)
- Mitigated recency bias by evaluating all projects over the same timeframe</p>
