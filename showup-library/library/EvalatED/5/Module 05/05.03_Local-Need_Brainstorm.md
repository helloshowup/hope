# 5.3 Local-Need Brainstorm

In this exercise, you'll identify real challenges in your local community and develop thoughtful, empathetic responses to address them. Community service is most effective when it responds to genuine needs rather than assumptions about what might help. By identifying local challenges and considering how to address them with empathy, you'll develop valuable skills for creating meaningful community impact.

## Activity Instructions

### Identify a Local Challenge

Start by observing your surroundings with fresh eyes. Every community has challenges that might go unnoticed in daily life. This exercise asks you to begin noticing these needs as a first step toward community engagement.

- What simple issues do you notice in your neighborhood, school, or community?
- Who might be affected by this challenge?
- What basic factors might contribute to this issue?

**Task:** Write a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing the challenge and why you believe it's important to address.

> ### Example Approaches
> 
> **Strong Example:** 
> ![Impact-vs-Feasibility matrix with 12 local issues ranked with color-coded rationale notes]
> 
> This student created an impact-vs-feasibility matrix to assess various community issues they noticed. They identified 12 different challenges (including youth mental health resources, food insecurity among seniors, and lack of safe bike lanes), ranked each by potential impact and implementation feasibility, and added color-coded notes explaining their reasoning. This systematic approach helped them select the most promising issue to address.
> 
> **Needs Improvement:**
> - Litter in parks
> - Homeless people downtown
> - Not enough activities for teens
> 
> This response simply lists three generic issues copied from the prompt without specific details about the local community, who is affected, or why these issues persist. The lack of specificity makes it difficult to develop a meaningful response.

### Develop an Empathetic Response

Now that you've identified a challenge, think about how you might address it while considering the people affected. This introduces the fundamental concept that effective community service involves understanding others' perspectives.

- Consider how those affected might feel about the situation
- Think about what basic resources might help address the issue
- Focus on a simple, practical approach

**Task:** Write 1-2 paragraphs explaining your proposed response and how it demonstrates empathy.

### Peer Exchange and Feedback 

Sharing ideas with others helps build a more complete understanding of community challenges. This foundational skill of exchanging perspectives will be essential as you progress to more complex community engagement work in future courses.

- Share what you appreciate about their response
- Ask one question about their approach
- Offer one simple suggestion

**Task:** Write a short reflection (5-7 sentences) addressing:
- What new insights did you gain through this exchange?
- How might you refine your approach based on the feedback?

### Reflection

Taking time to think about what you've learned is an important part of the process. This basic reflection practice will be expanded in future coursework.

**Task:** Write 3-5 sentences addressing:
- What did you learn from this exercise?
- How might you improve your approach?
- What was interesting about hearing another perspective?

The learning process doesn't end with creating a responseâ€”reflection deepens understanding and improves future efforts. Taking time to consider feedback and different perspectives helps refine approaches to community challenges. This final step transforms the activity from a simple assignment into a meaningful learning experience with lasting impact.

Remember, the goal of this activity isn't to solve complex social problems in one step, but to practice identifying needs through an empathetic lens and to learn from diverse perspectives. These skills form the foundation of meaningful community service.
