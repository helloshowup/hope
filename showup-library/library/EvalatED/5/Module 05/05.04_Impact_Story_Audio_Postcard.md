# 5.4 Impact Story Audio Postcard

Welcome to the Impact Story Audio Postcard project! In this activity, you'll craft a compelling 90-second audio narrative that illustrates the potential impact of service and demonstrates empathy. This creative exercise challenges you to translate abstract concepts of community service into concrete, emotional stories that listeners can connect with. By creating this audio postcard, you'll develop storytelling skills while deepening your understanding of how service initiatives can transform lives.

## What is an Impact Story Audio Postcard?

An Impact Story Audio Postcard is a brief audio recording that captures a narrative about how service can create meaningful change. It's similar to a postcard sent through sound rather than mailâ€”a snapshot that transports listeners to a moment where service made a difference. Your recording should last about 90 seconds, which means you'll need to focus on the essential elements of your message.

A good impact story needs basic structure and emotional connection. Your story should take listeners through a simple journey that shows how a problem was addressed through service.

### Character and Context

Start by introducing who is being helped by the service activity. Create a simple character that listeners can understand and care about. Briefly describe their situation before receiving help.

### The Service Initiative

Explain what the service initiative is and how it works. Keep it simple, but make sure listeners understand the actions being taken to address a need.

This is the heart of your audio postcard. Illustrate specific, tangible ways the service initiative changes lives. Use concrete details and sensory language to help listeners visualize the transformation. Consider including:

- Unexpected positive outcomes
- Ripple effects beyond the immediate recipient

### Emotional Resonance

End with a moment that captures the emotional significance of the impact. This could be:
- A reflection from the perspective of someone affected
