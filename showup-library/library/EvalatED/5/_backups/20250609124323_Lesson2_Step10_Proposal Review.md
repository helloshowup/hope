# 5.10 Proposal Review: Instructor/AI Rubric Gate

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the purpose and importance of the proposal review process
- Identify the key components of the instructor/AI rubric evaluation
- Apply rubric criteria to evaluate sample proposals
- Recognize common proposal issues that prevent field scheduling approval

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

### Introduction

Before any field-based learning experience can be scheduled, all student proposals must pass through a critical quality checkpoint: the Instructor/AI rubric gate. This evaluation process ensures that students have developed well-structured, feasible, and educationally sound proposals before investing time in real-world engagements. The review process protects both students from pursuing underdeveloped projects and community partners from committing to poorly conceived initiatives. This lesson explores how the review process works, what criteria are assessed, and how to successfully navigate this important quality assurance step.

### The Purpose of the Rubric Gate

The Instructor/AI rubric gate serves as a quality control mechanism that validates proposal readiness before allowing progression to field scheduling. This systematic evaluation ensures that all proposals meet established academic standards and practical feasibility requirements. 

**Key purposes of the review process:**
1. Verifies that proposals align with course learning objectives
2. Confirms that projects are logistically viable within the available timeframe and resources
3. Identifies any potential ethical or safety concerns before real-world implementation

**Real-world comparison:** Think of this review as similar to a pre-flight checklist that pilots must complete before takeoff. Just as skipping safety checks could lead to serious problems mid-flight, bypassing thorough proposal review could result in project failure once in the field. The rubric provides structure to this evaluation, ensuring consistent assessment across all student proposals.

### The Dual-Review System

Excel High School employs a dual-review system combining instructor expertise with AI-assisted evaluation. This hybrid approach leverages both human judgment and technological consistency.

**Components of the review system:**
* **AI evaluation:** Analyzes proposals against standardized criteria including format compliance, completeness, clarity of objectives, and alignment with course requirements
* **Instructor review:** Focuses on qualitative aspects such as creativity, critical thinking, ethical considerations, and subject-matter appropriateness

**Real-world comparison:** This system resembles how modern healthcare often combines algorithmic diagnostics with physician expertise. The AI can quickly identify structural issues and missing elements, while instructors provide nuanced feedback on content quality and conceptual understanding. Together, they create a comprehensive evaluation that addresses both technical and substantive aspects of the proposal.

### Navigating the Review Process

Successfully passing the rubric gate requires understanding both the evaluation criteria and the revision process.

**Key rubric dimensions:**
* Problem statement clarity
* Methodology appropriateness
* Timeline feasibility
* Resource identification
* Anticipated outcomes
* Reflection plan

Each dimension receives a score, and proposals must achieve minimum thresholds in all categories to proceed to field scheduling.

**The feedback and revision process:**
* If your proposal doesn't meet standards, you'll receive detailed feedback highlighting specific areas for improvement
* This feedback is instructional rather than merely evaluative
* Students typically have multiple opportunities to revise and resubmit proposals based on feedback
* Think of it like receiving code review comments when developing softwareâ€”specific suggestions that help strengthen your work

### Practice Activity: Evaluating Sample Proposals

Review the three sample proposals provided below. Using the rubric criteria we've discussed, identify strengths and weaknesses in each. Which proposals would pass the review gate, and which would require revision? What specific feedback would you provide?

**Sample Proposal 1: Community Garden Initiative**
* **Problem Statement:** Local food desert with limited access to fresh produce
* **Methodology:** Weekly gardening sessions, soil testing, planting schedule
* **Timeline:** 8 weeks (March-April) with specific milestones
* **Resources:** Community space secured, tools needed, $200 budget identified
* **Outcomes:** Produce 100 lbs of vegetables, educate 15 community members
* **Reflection:** Weekly journal entries and final presentation planned

**Sample Proposal 2: Youth Mentorship Program**
* **Problem Statement:** Middle school students need academic support
* **Methodology:** One-on-one tutoring sessions
* **Timeline:** "A few months during the semester"
* **Resources:** "Will find materials as needed"
* **Outcomes:** "Help students do better in school"
* **Reflection:** "Will write about what I learned"

**Sample Proposal 3: Small Business Digital Marketing**
* **Problem Statement:** Local bookstore struggling with online presence during pandemic
* **Methodology:** Social media audit, content calendar creation, analytics tracking
* **Timeline:** 6 weeks with detailed weekly objectives
* **Resources:** Access to store's accounts needed, using free tools identified
* **Outcomes:** Increase social engagement by 25%, develop sustainable strategy
* **Reflection:** Bi-weekly check-ins with store owner, data analysis report, personal skills assessment

### Key Takeaways

* The proposal review process is a critical quality assurance step that benefits both students and community partners
* Understanding the specific rubric criteria helps you develop stronger initial proposals
* Feedback should be viewed as a learning opportunity, not a setback
* Multiple revision opportunities ensure you can refine your proposal to meet all requirements

### Next Steps

After your proposal passes the rubric gate, you'll move to the field scheduling phase, which we'll cover in the next lesson. Be prepared to discuss how your approved proposal will translate into concrete field arrangements.
