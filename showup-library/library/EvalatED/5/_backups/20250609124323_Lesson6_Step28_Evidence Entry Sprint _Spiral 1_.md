# 5.28 Evidence Entry Sprint

Welcome to the Evidence Entry Sprint for Spiral 1! This is your opportunity to showcase your growth by uploading evidence of your learning journey. In this sprint, you'll revisit three key areas: Community Service Impact, Balance Strategies, and Reflective Practice. This time, we're elevating your understanding from application to evaluation—allowing you to critically assess your work and experiences to draw meaningful conclusions about your development.

## What to Submit
For each core concept below, you'll need to submit evidence that demonstrates your ability to **evaluate** rather than simply describe. Your Success Coach is available through the Excel High School portal if you need guidance on selecting appropriate evidence.

## Evaluating Community Service Impact
For this section, you'll need to move beyond simply documenting your service activities to critically analyzing their effectiveness and significance. Evaluation requires examining both the intended and unintended consequences of your community engagement. Consider how your service connected to broader community needs and whether the outcomes matched your initial goals.

* Measurable outcomes of your service (both numbers and observed changes)
* How your contributions addressed specific community needs
* Whether the impact you created will last
* Unexpected results or challenges you encountered

**Evidence Examples:**
* Impact reports with before/after comparisons
* Testimonials from community members with your analysis
* Reflection journal that evaluates effectiveness (not just describes activities)
* Visual documentation with analytical commentary

## Evaluating Balance Strategies

In this section, focus on assessing the effectiveness of your approaches to maintaining balance in your life. Rather than simply listing what you did, critically examine which strategies produced meaningful results and why certain approaches worked better than others. This evaluation should reveal insights about your personal patterns and preferences.

* Which specific strategies worked best/worst for you and why
* How you've adapted your approach based on changing circumstances
* Connections between your balance strategies and your overall wellbeing

**Evidence Examples:**
* Time management logs with your analysis of patterns
* Comparison chart of different strategies with effectiveness ratings
* Journal entries that evaluate (not just describe) your balance approaches
* Before/after snapshots showing how your strategies evolved

## Evaluating Reflective Practice

Upload evidence demonstrating your ability to evaluate your own reflective practice skills. This meta-cognitive process involves:

The focus here is on examining the quality and depth of your reflection process itself. This higher-order thinking requires stepping back to analyze how effectively you've been reflecting and what patterns emerge in your reflective practice. Consider how your approach to reflection has evolved and what this reveals about your growth as a learner.

* Identifying patterns in how you think and process experiences
* Analyzing how reflection has influenced your decisions and actions

**Evidence Examples:**
* Annotated reflective journal with your comments on the quality of earlier entries
* "Reflection on your reflections" that analyzes your growth as a reflective thinker
* Documentation showing how reflection led to specific changes in your approach

## Submission Guidelines
* Upload your evidence files in PDF, JPG, or MP4 format
* Each file should be clearly labeled with your name and the core concept (e.g., "JSmith_CommunityServiceEvaluation")
* Include a brief description (1-2 sentences) with each file explaining what the evidence demonstrates
* Submit all files through the Evidence Entry portal by [DUE DATE]

Remember, the key is to show evaluation—making informed judgments about effectiveness and impact rather than simply describing what you did.
