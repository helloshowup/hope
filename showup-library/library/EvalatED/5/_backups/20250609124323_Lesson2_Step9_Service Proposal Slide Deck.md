# 5.9  Service Proposal Slide Deck Guide

## Introduction
Creating an effective service proposal is essential for communicating your volunteer project plans clearly and persuasively. This guide will help you develop a professional 5-slide presentation that outlines a community need, your detailed plan to address it, and your team's leadership structure. A well-crafted slide deck demonstrates your understanding of volunteer service while showcasing your communication skills and organizational thinking.

## Core Elements of Your Service Proposal Slide Deck

### Slide 1: Title and Team Introduction
Your first slide should include:
- A compelling title for your service project
- Team member names and roles
- A single powerful image representing your cause
- Date of proposal

**Pro Tip:** Keep your title concise but descriptive (7-10 words maximum).

### Slide 2: Community Need Assessment
This slide should clearly articulate:
- The specific community need or problem identified
- Supporting evidence (statistics, testimonials, observations)
- Why addressing this need matters
- Who will benefit from your service

**Example:** Instead of "Helping the homeless," specify "Addressing winter clothing shortages for 200+ unhoused residents in downtown Phoenix."

### Slide 3: Service Plan Overview
Present your solution with:
- Clear objectives (what you aim to accomplish)
- Timeline of activities with specific dates
- Required resources and materials (be specific about quantities and costs)
- Expected outcomes and how you'll measure success

**Checkpoint:** Are your objectives SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)?

### Slide 4: Leadership Structure
Detail your team organization:
- Organizational chart showing team hierarchy
- Specific responsibilities for each team member
- Communication protocols between team members
- Decision-making process

**Interactive Element:** Consider including a QR code linking to team member bios or additional project details.

### Slide 5: Implementation and Follow-up
Conclude with:
- Key milestones and checkpoints
- Potential challenges and contingency plans
- Sustainability considerations (how impact continues)
- Contact information for questions

**Reflection Question:** How will you know if your service project was successful?

## Design Tips
The visual presentation of your slide deck is just as important as the content itself. A well-designed presentation enhances comprehension and engagement, while poor design choices can distract from your message. The following design principles will help ensure your service proposal communicates effectively and professionally across diverse audiences and viewing environments.

- Use consistent fonts (1-2 maximum) and a color scheme (3-4 colors) throughout
- Include relevant images that enhance understanding
- Keep text concise (5-7 bullet points per slide with 5-7 words per bullet)
- Ensure all text is at least 24pt font size for readability
- Balance text with visual elements on each slide
- Use high-contrast colors for better accessibility
