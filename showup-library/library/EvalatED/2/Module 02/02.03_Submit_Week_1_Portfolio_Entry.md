# 2.3 Submit Week 1 Portfolio Entry

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Compile a complete Week 1 portfolio with all required components following proper formatting guidelines
- Document network configurations and diagrams that demonstrate your understanding of BC_NET fundamentals
- Track your progress by reflecting on what you've learned in Week 1

## Introduction

Welcome to your first portfolio submission for Excel High School! This important step allows you to demonstrate your understanding of BC_NET concepts covered in Week 1. Your portfolio serves as both a learning tool and an assessment of your progress. By organizing and submitting your work, you'll create a valuable resource for future reference while showing what you've learned. This submission is an essential milestone before moving on to more advanced concepts.

## Understanding the Portfolio Submission Process

The portfolio submission process is designed to help you organize your learning artifacts in a structured manner. Think of your portfolio as a professional showcase of your developing skills in BC_NET fundamentals. Each component serves a specific purpose in demonstrating your technical understanding and analytical abilities. The portfolio also provides your instructor with valuable insights into your learning progress, allowing for targeted feedback that can help strengthen areas where you might need additional support.

As you prepare your submission, remember that attention to detail matters in networking documentation. The habits you develop now—thorough documentation, clear diagrams, and thoughtful reflection—mirror the professional standards expected in real-world networking environments.

The submission process is straightforward:
* Gather all required documents
* Follow the formatting guidelines
* Compile into a single PDF (if required)
* Upload to the designated area in your student portal

Before finalizing your submission, take time to review each component for accuracy and completeness. Technical documentation requires precision, and small errors in network configurations or diagrams can have significant implications in real-world scenarios. Many students find it helpful to have a checklist of required items and to review their work after taking a short break to catch any overlooked details.

The portfolio submission also serves as a valuable learning checkpoint. By organizing and reviewing your work from Week 1, you'll reinforce key concepts and identify any knowledge gaps before moving forward. This process of compilation and reflection often leads to "aha moments" where concepts suddenly connect in meaningful ways.

## Required Portfolio Components

Your Week 1 portfolio submission must include:

1. **Completed Assignments**: All homework tasks from Week 1 (worksheets, problem sets, written responses)

2. **BC_NET Network Diagram**: Your detailed network diagram showing proper topology and configuration based on Week 1 specifications

3. **Configuration Documentation**: Written documentation of all network configurations you've implemented, including addressing schemes and protocols

4. **Self-Assessment Reflection**: A brief (250-300 word) reflection discussing:
   * Your understanding of Week 1 concepts
   * Challenges you faced
   * Areas where you feel confident
   * Areas where you need additional practice

**Important:** Label each component with your name, date, and specific assignment title. Make sure your work is organized according to the formatting guidelines in your syllabus.

## Submission Guidelines

To successfully submit your Week 1 portfolio:

1. **Review for Completeness**: Verify you've included all required components

2. **Check Formatting**: Ensure all documents follow proper formatting requirements

3. **Submit Through Portal**: Log into your Excel High School student portal and navigate to the assignment submission area

4. **Upload Files**: Upload your portfolio as instructed

5. **Confirm Submission**: Check for confirmation messages and review your submission history

The deadline for your Week 1 portfolio is in your course calendar. Late submissions may incur penalties as outlined in your syllabus.

## Reflection Questions

Take a moment to consider these questions before submitting:

1. What aspect of your Week 1 work are you most proud of, and why does it demonstrate your understanding of BC_NET concepts?

2. What challenges did you encounter while completing your Week 1 assignments, and what strategies did you use to overcome them?

3. Based on your experience with Week 1 content, what specific areas of BC_NET would you like to explore further?

These reflection questions serve multiple purposes in your learning journey. They encourage metacognition—thinking about your own thinking and learning processes—which research shows enhances knowledge retention and application. By analyzing your strengths and challenges, you develop greater self-awareness as a learner. This reflection also helps you identify patterns in your learning approach that may benefit from adjustment as you progress through the course.

Additionally, your responses provide valuable feedback to your instructor about which concepts resonated with you and which areas might benefit from additional explanation or resources. Many students find that articulating their learning experience in writing helps solidify their understanding and reveals connections between concepts that weren't immediately apparent during the initial learning activities.
