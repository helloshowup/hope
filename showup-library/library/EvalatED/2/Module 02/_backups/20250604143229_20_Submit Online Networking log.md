This submission demonstrates your ability to build a professional network in digital spaces and leverage these connections for career development.

## Core Concept 1: Understanding the Online Networking Log Purpose
The Online Networking Log serves as documentation of your active participation in professional online communities. This log validates that you've engaged meaningfully with industry professionals, peers, and relevant organizations in your field of study.

The log isn't just about quantity of connections but quality of engagement. Each entry should represent a meaningful interaction that contributed to your professional growth or knowledge base.

Your Online Networking Log should include the following components for each networking interaction:

4. **Value Gained**: Explain what you learned from this interaction and how it relates to your professional goals

5. **Follow-up Actions**: Document any planned or completed follow-up activities to maintain the connection

Aim to include at least 5-7 distinct networking interactions that span different platforms or professional contexts. This demonstrates your ability to navigate various online networking environments.

## Core Concept 3: Submitting Your Completed Log
When your Online Networking Log is complete, follow these steps to submit it for review:

1. **Format Check**: Ensure your log is properly formatted with all required information for each entry. Review for clarity, professionalism, and completeness.

2. **Reflection Statement**: Add a brief (250-300 word) reflection at the end of your log discussing how these networking experiences have influenced your professional development and future networking strategies.

3. **File Preparation**: Save your document as a PDF with the filename format: "LastName_FirstName_NetworkingLog.pdf"
