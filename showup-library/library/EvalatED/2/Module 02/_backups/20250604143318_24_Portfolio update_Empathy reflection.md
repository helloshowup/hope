## Documenting Your Empathetic Exchange

### The Exchange Context
Begin by describing the situation where you practiced empathy. Include relevant details about:
- Who was involved (maintaining appropriate privacy)
- The setting and circumstances
- What needs or emotions you recognized in the other person
- Your initial thoughts and feelings entering the interaction

**Tip:** Focus on a recent, authentic interaction where you genuinely attempted to understand someone else's perspective.

### Empathetic Strategies Used
Identify and explain the specific empathetic techniques you utilized during this exchange. Consider including:

1. **Active Listening Techniques**: Document how you demonstrated full attention through:
   - Maintaining appropriate eye contact
   - Using affirming body language
   - Avoiding interruptions
   - Putting aside distractions

2. **Verbal Empathy Skills**: Describe specific verbal approaches such as:
   - Reflective statements ("It sounds like you felt...")
   - Clarifying questions to better understand perspectives
   - Validation phrases that acknowledged feelings
   - Avoiding judgment or premature advice-giving

3. **Perspective-Taking Efforts**: Explain how you:
   - Attempted to see the situation through their viewpoint
   - Set aside your own assumptions or biases
   - Recognized cultural or contextual factors
   - Connected with universal emotions despite differences

**Example:** "When my friend expressed frustration about their job, I noticed myself wanting to immediately offer solutions. Instead, I asked, 'What part has been most difficult for you?' and simply listened to understand their experience better."
