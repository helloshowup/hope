# 2.25 Portfolio Update: Best Practices List

## Top Five Networking Tips I've Learned from Peers

Networking is an essential skill in today's interconnected professional world. Through my interactions with classmates and mentors, I've gathered valuable insights that have significantly improved my networking approach. Below are the five most impactful networking tips I've learned from my peers.

### 1. Lead with Genuine Curiosity, Not Self-Promotion

One of the most consistent pieces of advice from successful networkers is to approach conversations with authentic interest in others. My classmate Jordan demonstrated this perfectly during our career fair when I observed how they asked thoughtful questions about others' projects before mentioning their own work. This approach created meaningful connections rather than transactional exchanges.

**Action Step:** Before your next networking opportunity, prepare 3-5 thoughtful questions that show you've done your homework about the person or organization. Focus on learning from others first, which naturally creates opportunities for you to share your own experiences in context.

### 2. Follow Up Meaningfully Within 24-48 Hours

My study group partner Alex taught me the "24-hour rule" - always follow up within a day of meeting someone new. What made this advice particularly valuable was the emphasis on personalization. Instead of generic "nice to meet you" messages, reference specific conversation points and include something of value (an article, resource, or introduction) related to what you discussed.

**Example:** "Hi [Name], I enjoyed our conversation about [specific topic] yesterday. I thought you might find this article helpful for your project on [topic we discussed]. I'd be happy to continue our conversation next week if you're available."

This approach has consistently turned one-time meetings into ongoing professional relationships for me and demonstrates both reliability and attentiveness.

### 3. Maintain a Networking Journal

This practical tip came from my peer mentor Taylor, who keeps detailed notes after each networking interaction. The journal includes:
- Key points from the conversation
- Potential follow-up topics
- Personal details (interests, family mentions)
- Action items or promises made

**Digital Tool Option:** Apps like Evernote or the notes app on your phone can help you quickly capture these details immediately after meetings.

Reviewing these notes before future interactions has helped me build stronger relationships by remembering important details and demonstrating that I value the connection enough to remember our previous conversations.

### 4. Leverage the Power of Weak Ties

My classmate Morgan introduced me to the concept of "weak ties" - connections outside your immediate circle who can provide access to entirely new networks. Research shows these connections often lead to more opportunities than close relationships because they bridge different social worlds.

**Reflection Question:** Who are 3-5 people you know casually (former classmates, friends of friends, etc.) who work in fields or organizations that interest you? Consider reaching out to reconnect.

Instead of focusing exclusively on high-profile connections, I've learned to value relationships with people from diverse backgrounds and industries, which has significantly expanded my access to information and opportunities.

### 5. Give Before You Ask

Perhaps the most transformative networking principle I've learned came from observing my peer Riley, who consistently looks for ways to help others without immediate expectation of return. Whether making introductions, sharing resources, or volunteering expertise, this "giver" mentality establishes trust and goodwill.

**Challenge:** For your next three networking conversations, identify one specific way you might help each new connection before considering how they might help you. This shift in mindset has not only made networking more enjoyable but has also resulted in stronger, more reciprocal professional relationships.

## Application Exercise
