  "reviewed_content": "# Proposal Review\n\n## Introduction\nBefore you can engage in field experiences, your proposal must undergo a thorough evaluation process. This critical checkpoint ensures that all planned activities meet Excel High School's academic standards and safety requirements. The proposal review serves as a quality control mechanism where instructors assess your work against established rubrics before approving field scheduling.\n\n## The Review Process\nDuring this phase, your proposal will be evaluated using a comprehensive rubric that examines:\n- **Alignment with learning objectives**: How well your proposed activities connect to your course goals\n- **Feasibility**: Whether your plan is realistic and achievable within your timeframe and resources\n- **Safety considerations**: Identification and mitigation of potential risks\n- **Ethical standards**: Adherence to responsible practices and appropriate permissions\n- **Academic rigor**: Depth of learning and critical thinking opportunities\n\n### What to Expect\n- Only proposals meeting minimum threshold scores across all rubric categories will be approved\n- If revisions are needed, you'll receive specific feedback highlighting areas for improvement\n- You can resubmit your revised proposal after addressing the feedback\n- Approved proposals allow you to proceed to field scheduling\n\n### Tips for Success\n- Review the rubric before starting your proposal\n- Be specific about how your field experience connects to your coursework\n- Consider potential challenges and include contingency plans\n- Reach out to your Success Coach if you need guidance",
