This ensures that parents/guardians are fully informed about the nature, location, and requirements of the fieldwork experience.\n\n## Authorization Process:\n1. Log into your Excel High School Student Portal\n2. Navigate to the \"Field Work Authorization\" form under the \"Forms & Documents\" section\n3. Review the fieldwork details with your parent/guardian\n4. Have your parent/guardian provide their digital signature on your device\n5. Submit the completed form at least 48 hours before your scheduled fieldwork\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* Students without proper authorization will not be permitted to participate in off-campus service activities\n* Parents/guardians can access additional fieldwork information through the Parent Portal\n* If you need assistance with the authorization process, contact your Success Coach\n\nFor homeschooling families: Both the student and the parent/guardian acting as the primary educator must complete separate sections of the authorization form.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, inclusivity, and relevance to Excel High School's diverse learner segments:\n\n1. Added a more specific title that includes \"Guardian\" to be more inclusive of different family structures\n2. Expanded the step-by-step instructions with more specific details about the Excel High School Student Portal\n3. Added an \"Important Notes\" section with bulleted information for better visual organization\n4. Included a specific note for homeschooling families, acknowledging this key learner segment\n5. Referenced Excel-specific support resources (Success Coach, Parent Portal)\n6. Improved formatting with clear section headings and visual organization to enhance readability\n7. Expanded the authorization process to include reviewing the details with the parent/guardian\n8. Used more inclusive language throughout (parent/guardian instead of just parent)\n\nThese changes better align the content with Excel High School's diverse learner segments, particularly addressing the needs of traditional students, homeschooling families, and adult learners who may be parents themselves."
