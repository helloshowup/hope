Removed the undefined term \"BC_STORY analysis\" throughout the document and replaced it with more general terms like \"effective analysis\" and \"analytical techniques\" to avoid confusion.\n\n2. Made the assignment more inclusive and applicable to any analytical field of study rather than referencing a specific methodology that wasn't explained.\n\n3. Simplified language throughout to improve clarity while maintaining the professional tone appropriate for Excel High School students.\n\n4. Maintained the overall structure, requirements, and evaluation criteria while making them more accessible to all learner segments identified in the profile.\n\n5.
