# Privacy Case Discussion

## Introduction
Welcome to our collaborative privacy case discussion! In today's digital world, artificial intelligence systems constantly collect, analyze, and share our data, raising important ethical questions about privacy and consent. This activity will give you the opportunity to evaluate real-world AI data-sharing dilemmas that are relevant to your daily life and develop thoughtful recommendations based on ethical principles and privacy considerations.

Through this discussion, you'll develop critical thinking skills about privacy issues, practice articulating and defending your position on complex ethical questions, and learn from different perspectives. These skills will help you navigate privacy considerations in both your academic and personal lives.

## Activity Guidelines

### Participation Requirements
1. Analyze your assigned case study using the framework provided
2. Include a clear recommendation with supporting justification
3. Base your analysis on ethical frameworks and privacy principles discussed in the course

### Case Study Options
You will be assigned one of the following AI data-sharing dilemmas:

1. **Social Media Photo Analysis**: A popular social media app used by many teens has been analyzing users' photos to improve its filters and features. A marketing company wants to purchase this data to target ads to specific age groups. The app is considering sharing anonymized data without asking users first since the terms of service mentioned "improving user experience."

2. **Gaming Platform Data**: A popular gaming platform collects data on players' gaming habits, chat conversations, and in-game purchases. The company wants to share this data with game developers to create more engaging games, but hasn't specifically told users about this data sharing practice.

3. **School AI Tutoring System**: Your school has implemented an AI tutoring system that tracks how students learn, what mistakes they commonly make, and how long they spend on different problems. The school is considering sharing this data with the local community college to help them prepare programs for incoming students. Students weren't told their learning patterns would be shared outside the school.

4. **Music Streaming App**: A music streaming service popular with teens has collected years of data about listening habits, creating detailed profiles of users' preferences and moods. A research company wants this data to study teen mental health patterns based on music choices. The streaming service must decide whether to share this data.

### Analysis Framework
When analyzing your assigned case, address the following questions:

1. **Stakeholder Identification**: Who are all the parties affected by this decision?
2. **Privacy Implications**: What privacy rights might be violated?
3. **Informed Consent**: Was appropriate consent obtained? If not, what would proper consent look like?
4. **Risk Assessment**: What potential harms could come from sharing this data?
5. **Benefits Analysis**: What potential benefits might result from sharing the data?
6. **Alternative Solutions**: Are there compromise solutions that could balance competing interests?

### Submission Format
Your submission should include:

1. **Case Summary**: Briefly restate the key facts (1-2 sentences)
2. **Analysis**: Apply the framework questions to evaluate the situation
3. **Recommendation**: Clearly state what you believe the organization should do
4. **Justification**: Defend your recommendation using ethical principles, privacy laws, or relevant frameworks
