<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Explain the purpose and benefits of portfolio-based assessment at Excel High School</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Navigate the portfolio evaluation process from submission to feedback</span></li>
<li>Apply best practices to create a successful portfolio submission that demonstrates competency
A portfolio submission is a collection of your work that demonstrates your mastery of specific learning objectives. Unlike traditional tests that capture performance at a single moment, portfolios showcase your development over time and your ability to apply knowledge in authentic contexts. Your portfolio might include projects, written assignments, multimedia presentations, or other artifacts that reflect your learning journey.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
At Excel High School, we value this approach because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to demonstrate knowledge in ways that align with your strengths</li>
<li>Provides a more comprehensive view of your abilities than traditional testing</li>
<li>Encourages deeper learning through application and reflection</li>
<li>Develops skills that transfer to real-world contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>Your portfolio submission will be evaluated against a detailed rubric that clearly outlines the expectations for demonstrating competency in each learning objective.
This rubric is accessible within your course materials and serves as the foundation for both creating and evaluating your work.</p>
<h3>The Evaluation Process</h3>
<p>When you submit your portfolio, it undergoes a thorough evaluation process designed to provide fair assessment and constructive feedback:</p>
<p><br/>
1. <strong>Initial Submission</strong>: You'll upload your completed portfolio materials through the learning platform.</p>
<p><br/>
2. <strong>Rubric-Based Evaluation</strong>: Your submission will be assessed using a detailed rubric that outlines specific criteria for demonstrating competency. This evaluation may be conducted by:</p>
<ul>
<li>An instructor who reviews your work and provides personalized feedback</li>
<li>Our AI-assisted evaluation system that analyzes your submission against the rubric criteria</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Feedback Generation</strong>: You'll receive comprehensive feedback highlighting your strengths and areas for improvement, aligned with the rubric criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/>
4. <strong>Competency Verification</strong>: Based on the rubric assessment, your submission will be evaluated to determine if you've demonstrated sufficient mastery of the learning objectives.</p>
<p><br/>
If your submission requires revisions, you'll receive specific guidance on improvements needed to demonstrate competency.
5. <strong>Next Module Access</strong>: Upon verification of competency, the next learning module will be automatically unlocked, allowing you to progress in your educational journey.</p>
<h2>Preparing Your Portfolio Submission</h2>
<h3>Understanding the Rubric</h3>
<p>The rubric is your roadmap to success. It clearly outlines what constitutes competent performance across various dimensions of learning. Before beginning your portfolio work, carefully review the rubric to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific criteria being evaluated</li>
<li>The levels of performance for each criterion</li>
<li>The weight or importance of different components</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Think of the rubric as your checklist for success. Refer to it frequently as you work on your portfolio to ensure you're meeting all requirements.</p>
<h3>Best Practices for Portfolio Creation</h3>
<p>To maximize your success with portfolio submission, consider these strategies:</p>
<p><br/>
1. <strong>Start Early</strong>: Give yourself ample time to create thoughtful, polished work.</p>
<p><br/>
2. <strong>Address All Requirements</strong>: Ensure your submission addresses each component outlined in the assignment guidelines and rubric.</p>
<p><br/>
3. <strong>Demonstrate Application</strong>: Show not just what you know, but how you can apply that knowledge to solve problems or create meaningful work.</p>
<p><br/>
4. <strong>Reflect on Your Learning</strong>: Include reflections on your process, challenges you overcame, and insights you gained.</p>
<p><br/>
5. <strong>Review Before Submission</strong>: Carefully proofread and review your work against the rubric before submitting.</p>
<p><br/>
6. <strong>Seek Feedback</strong>: When possible, have peers, family members, or mentors review your work and provide input before final submission.
These resources can provide valuable guidance on structuring your portfolio, refining your work, and ensuring alignment with rubric requirements.</p>
<p><br/>
7. <strong>Use Available Resources</strong>: Take advantage of Excel High School's Writing Lab, Success Coach Pro, and BRYTE AI Tutor if you need additional support.</p>
