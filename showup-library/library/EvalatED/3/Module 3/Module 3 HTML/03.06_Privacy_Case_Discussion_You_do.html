Welcome to our collaborative privacy case discussion! In today's digital world, artificial intelligence systems constantly collect, analyze, and share our data, raising important ethical questions about privacy and consent. This activity will give you the opportunity to evaluate real-world AI data-sharing dilemmas that are relevant to your daily life and develop thoughtful recommendations based on ethical principles and privacy considerations.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
Through this discussion, you'll develop critical thinking skills about privacy issues, practice articulating and defending your position on complex ethical questions, and learn from different perspectives. These skills will help you navigate privacy considerations in both your academic and personal lives.</p>
<h2>Activity Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Participation Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>Analyze your assigned case study using the framework provided</li>
<li>Include a clear recommendation with supporting justification</li>
<li>Base your analysis on ethical frameworks and privacy principles discussed in the course</li>
</ol>
<h3>Case Study Options</h3>
<p>Each case study presents a realistic scenario where AI and data sharing intersect with privacy concerns. These situations mirror challenges that organizations face today when balancing technological innovation with ethical responsibilities. As you review the options below, consider how these scenarios might relate to your own experiences with technology and data sharing.</p>
<p><br/>
You will be assigned one of the following AI data-sharing dilemmas:</p>
<p><br/>
1. <strong>Social Media Photo Analysis</strong>: A popular social media app used by many teens has been analyzing users' photos to improve its filters and features. A marketing company wants to purchase this data to target ads to specific age groups. The app is considering sharing anonymized data without asking users first since the terms of service mentioned "improving user experience."</p>
<p><br/>
2. <strong>Gaming Platform Data</strong>: A popular gaming platform collects data on players' gaming habits, chat conversations, and in-game purchases. The company wants to share this data with game developers to create more engaging games, but hasn't specifically told users about this data sharing practice.</p>
<p><br/>
3. <strong>School AI Tutoring System</strong>: Your school has implemented an AI tutoring system that tracks how students learn, what mistakes they commonly make, and how long they spend on different problems. The school is considering sharing this data with the local community college to help them prepare programs for incoming students. Students weren't told their learning patterns would be shared outside the school.</p>
<p><br/>
For a thorough analysis, you'll need a structured approach to evaluate each case. The framework below provides key questions to guide your thinking process. Working through these questions systematically will help you uncover the ethical complexities in each scenario and develop well-reasoned recommendations based on privacy principles.</p>
<h3>Analysis Framework</h3>
<p>Your submission should include:</p>
<p><br/>
1. <strong>Stakeholder Identification</strong>: Who are all the parties affected by this decision?
2. <strong>Privacy Implications</strong>: What privacy rights might be violated?
4. <strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: What are the potential harms of sharing this data?
5. <strong>Benefit Analysis</strong>: What are the potential benefits of sharing this data?
6. <strong>Alternative Solutions</strong>: Are there compromise solutions that could balance competing interests?</p>
<p><br/>
After completing your analysis, you'll need to organize your thoughts into a clear, structured response. The submission format outlined below will help you present your reasoning in a logical way that demonstrates your understanding of both the technical and ethical dimensions of the case. This format also ensures your instructor can effectively evaluate your critical thinking skills.</p>
<h3>Submission Format</h3>
<p>Your submission should include:</p>
<p><br/>
1. <strong>Case Summary</strong>: Briefly restate the key facts (1-2 sentences)
2. <strong>Analysis</strong>: Apply the framework questions to evaluate the situation
3. <strong>Recommendation</strong>: Clearly state what you believe the organization should do
4. <strong>Justification</strong>: Defend your recommendation using ethical principles, privacy laws, or relevant frameworks</p>
<h3>Example Submission Structure</h3>
<pre><code>Case Summary: [Brief restatement of the case facts]
&lt;br/&gt;
Analysis:
- Stakeholders include: [List relevant parties]
- Privacy implications: [Discuss potential privacy violations]
- Consent considerations: [Evaluate whether proper consent exists]
- Risks of data sharing: [Identify potential harms]
- Benefits of data sharing: [Identify potential benefits]
- Alternative approaches: [Suggest compromise solutions]
Recommendation: [Clear statement of what should be done]
&lt;br/&gt;
Justification: [Explanation of why this recommendation is ethically sound]
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that there are rarely perfect solutions to these complex dilemmas. The goal is not to find the "right" answer but to demonstrate thoughtful ethical reasoning. Your instructor will evaluate the depth of your analysis, the clarity of your recommendation, and the strength of your justification.</p>
