<h2>Discussion Prompt</h2>

<li>How has this experience influenced how you approach goal-setting now?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Response Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Share your personal experience with specific details to help your classmates understand your situation.</li>

<h2>Example Discussion Post</h2>
<p><em>I'd like to share my experience adapting my academic goals during my sophomore year. I originally planned to complete a dual concentration in Business and Computer Science, taking 18 credits each semester. This was important to me because I wanted to graduate with specialized skills that would make me competitive in the tech industry.</em></p>
<p><em>Three weeks into my second semester, my mother was diagnosed with a serious illness, and I needed to take on additional family responsibilities while she underwent treatment. Suddenly, my carefully planned academic schedule became impossible to maintain.</em></p>
<p><em>Initially, I felt like a failure for not being able to handle everything. I struggled with guilt about reducing my course load and worried about delaying my graduation. The most difficult part was accepting that I couldn't control the circumstances—only my response to them.</em></p>
<p><em>I eventually spoke with my academic advisor, who helped me create a more flexible timeline. I reduced my course load to 12 credits, prioritized classes that aligned with both concentrations, and found online options that allowed me to study during the hours I wasn't helping at home.</em></p>
<p><em>This experience taught me that adaptability isn't about giving up on goals—it's about finding new paths to what matters most. I learned to distinguish between my actual priorities (gaining skills for my career) and the specific timeline I had attached to them (graduating by a certain date).</em></p>
<p><em>Now when I set goals, I focus more on the "why" behind them rather than the exact "how" or "when." I've become more intentional about building flexibility into my plans from the beginning, and I'm better at recognizing when my attachment to a specific approach is getting in the way of my larger purpose.</em></p>
<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<p>Now it's your turn to share. Remember that vulnerability creates connection, and your experience of adapting goals might provide valuable insights for your classmates. There is no "perfect" way to handle changing circumstances—we all navigate challenges differently based on our unique situations, resources, and perspectives.</p>
