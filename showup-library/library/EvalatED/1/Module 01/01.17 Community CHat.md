## Example Discussion Post

*If I were helping my younger brother develop a growth mindset, I'd start by explaining it this way:*

*"A growth mindset is believing your abilities can improve with effort and practice—like a muscle that gets stronger when you work it out. It's the difference between thinking 'I'm just not good at math' versus 'I haven't figured out how to solve these problems yet.' The first stops you from trying; the second keeps the door open for improvement."*

*I'd share how this changed my own experience with basketball. Last year, I couldn't make free throws consistently and almost quit the team because I thought I just "wasn't athletic." My coach suggested I track my progress instead of focusing on failures. After two months of daily practice and keeping a progress journal, my free throw percentage improved from 30% to 65%. The skill didn't magically appear—it developed through consistent effort and learning from mistakes.*

*The most helpful strategy for me has been replacing "I can't" with "I can't yet." This tiny word makes a huge difference in how I approach challenges. I'd suggest they try this simple language shift for just one week and notice how it changes their perspective.*

*Rather than lecturing someone stuck in a fixed mindset, I'd ask curious questions like: "What's something you're really good at now that you once struggled with?" or "Remember when you learned to ride a bike? What would have happened if you'd given up after the first fall?" These questions help people recognize their own growth history.*

*To encourage reflection, I might ask: "What's something you've always wanted to learn but felt you couldn't?" Then follow up with: "What would happen if you gave yourself permission to be bad at it while learning?"*
