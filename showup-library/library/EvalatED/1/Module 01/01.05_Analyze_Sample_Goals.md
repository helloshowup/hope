# 1.5 Analyze Sample Goals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Evaluate goal statements against the five SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Identify common weaknesses in poorly constructed goals
- Transform vague goal statements into effective SMART goals that drive results

Setting goals is one thing, but setting effective goals that drive results is another skill entirely. In this section, we'll put our SMART goal knowledge into practice by examining real examples. By analyzing sample goals against the SMART criteria, we'll develop our critical eye for goal-setting and learn to identify common pitfalls. This practical exercise will help you transform vague intentions into powerful, actionable objectives that can guide your academic journey at Excel High School.

## Evaluating Sample Goals

Let's examine several goal statements together and evaluate them against our SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For each example, we'll identify strengths and weaknesses, then discuss how to improve them.

### Example 1: "I want to do better in school."

Let's evaluate this against our SMART criteria:
- **Specific**: ❌ Not specific at all. What does "better" mean? Which subjects?
- **Measurable**: ❌ No way to measure "better" as stated.
- **Achievable**: ❓ Without specifics, we can't determine if it's achievable.
- **Relevant**: ✅ Improving academically is relevant for a student.
- **Time-bound**: ❌ No timeframe mentioned.

**Improved Version**: "I will raise my Algebra grade from a C to a B by the end of the current semester by completing all homework assignments and attending weekly tutoring sessions."

This improved goal specifies the subject (Algebra), defines "better" (C to B), includes a timeframe (end of semester), and outlines specific actions to achieve it.

### Example 2: "I will read more books."

Let's evaluate:
- **Specific**: ❌ What types of books? How many is "more"?
- **Measurable**: ❌ "More" isn't quantifiable without a baseline.
- **Achievable**: ❓ Cannot determine without specifics.
- **Relevant**: ❓ Reading is generally beneficial, but the relevance to specific goals is unclear.
- **Time-bound**: ❌ No deadline or timeframe.

**Improved Version**: "I will read four fiction books (at least 200 pages each) by the end of this quarter to improve my reading comprehension and vocabulary for English class."

The improved goal specifies quantity (four books), type (fiction), minimum length (200 pages), timeframe (end of quarter), and connects to a specific purpose (improving reading comprehension and vocabulary).

### Example 3: "I'll finish my Excel High School diploma someday."

Let's evaluate:
- **Specific**: ✅ The goal mentions completing a diploma at Excel High School.
- **Measurable**: ✅ Completion of diploma is measurable.
- **Achievable**: ✅ Presumably achievable as the student is enrolled.
- **Relevant**: ✅ Very relevant to educational progress.
- **Time-bound**: ❌ "Someday" is not a specific timeframe.

**Improved Version**: "I will complete my Excel High School diploma by May 2024 by finishing two courses each month and meeting with my academic advisor quarterly to stay on track."

This improved goal maintains the specificity but adds a concrete deadline and outlines the pace needed to achieve it.

## Key Takeaways
- Effective goals must satisfy all five SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to transform vague intentions into actionable objectives that drive results.
- Common weaknesses in goal statements include using ambiguous terms like "better" or "more," lacking concrete timeframes, and failing to specify measurable outcomes.
- Transforming a weak goal into a SMART goal requires adding specificity about what will be accomplished, quantifiable metrics to track progress, and clear deadlines that create accountability.
