# 1.10 Submit Motivation Plan

Congratulations on developing your personalized motivation plan and tracking system! This important milestone represents your commitment to understanding and managing your own motivationâ€”a critical skill for academic success. Before we move forward to explore resilience strategies, it's essential to ensure your motivation plan is comprehensive, realistic, and tailored to your specific needs. Submitting your plan now allows for valuable feedback that will strengthen your approach and help you build a solid foundation for the resilience concepts ahead.

## Why This Submission Matters

Your motivation plan submission serves multiple important purposes:
- It provides an opportunity for constructive feedback on your strategies and tracking methods
- The submission process itself reinforces your commitment to following through
- This checkpoint ensures you have a solid motivational framework before adding resilience skills

The relationship between motivation and resilience is deeply interconnected. While motivation drives you forward, resilience helps you bounce back when obstacles arise. Having a strong motivation plan in place first ensures you'll be able to more effectively integrate resilience strategies into your overall approach to academic success.

## What to Include in Your Submission

Your submission should include these two key components:

1. **Your Weekly Motivation Plan**:
   - Your identified motivational strengths and challenges
   - Specific strategies you've selected to enhance intrinsic motivation
   - Methods for managing extrinsic motivators
   - Clear, achievable goals with timelines
   - Anticipated obstacles and plans to overcome them
   - Resources or support systems you'll utilize

2. **Your Motivation Tracker**:
   - The format you've created to monitor your motivation levels
   - How you'll record daily/weekly motivation observations
   - Your method for identifying patterns or triggers
   - How you'll measure progress toward your goals
   - Your system for adjusting strategies based on tracking data

Ensure both components reflect thoughtful consideration of the concepts we've explored throughout the motivation module. Your plan should be personalized to your unique circumstances, learning style, and academic goals.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your motivation plan and tracker:

1. Review both documents for completeness and clarity
2. Ensure all sections include specific, actionable information
3. Check that your tracking system is practical and sustainable
4. Verify that your plan incorporates key motivation principles from previous lessons
5. Submit both documents through the assignment submission area below
6. Be prepared to make revisions based on feedback

## Next Steps

After submitting your motivation plan and tracker, you'll receive feedback within 3-5 business days. This feedback will highlight strengths in your approach and suggest potential refinements. You may be asked to make adjustments before proceeding to the resilience module.

While waiting for feedback, continue implementing your motivation strategies and using your tracker. This practical experience will provide valuable insights that may inform any revisions you make. The goal is not perfection but rather creating a workable system that genuinely supports your academic journey.
