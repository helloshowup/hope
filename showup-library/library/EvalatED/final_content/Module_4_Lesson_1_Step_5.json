Once approved, you'll automatically gain access to the next concept in this module.\n\n### Reflection Tips\n- Focus on specific examples rather than generalizations\n- Consider both immediate and potential long-term impacts\n- Relate your experience to your personal values or future goals\n- Be honest about challenges you encountered\n\nThis checkpoint ensures you've meaningfully processed your community service experience before continuing with the curriculum.\n\n**Note:** Focus on authentic reflection rather than length or production quality. If you need accommodations for the audio portion, please contact your Success Coach.\n\n### Need Help?\nIf you have questions or need technical assistance with your submission, contact the Excel High School Support Team through your Student Portal or at support@excelhighschool.com.",
