This interactive walkthrough will guide you through the essential features of our parent portal, designed to keep you connected with your student's educational journey. The parent portal serves as your window into your student's academic progress, allowing you to communicate with teachers, approve certain activities, and monitor overall advancement. By mastering these tools, you'll be equipped to actively participate in your student's education, providing the support and guidance they need to succeed at Excel High School.\n\n## Messaging System\n\nThe messaging system is your direct line of communication with teachers, counselors, and administrators. This feature eliminates the need for phone tag or delayed email responses, creating an efficient channel for addressing questions or concerns.\n\nTo access the messaging center, click on the \"Messages\" icon in the left navigation panel. You'll see a clean interface with folders for inbox, sent messages, and archived communications. Creating a new message is simple - click the \"Compose\" button, select the recipient from the dropdown menu (which includes all your student's teachers and support staff), enter a subject, type your message, and click \"Send.\"\n\nThe messaging system also allows you to attach files when necessary, such as doctor's notes for absences or supporting documents for academic accommodations. All messages are securely stored in your account history, creating a documented record of all communications that you can reference at any time.\n\n## Approvals Center\n\nThe Approvals Center is where you'll review and authorize various student activities and requests. This feature ensures you stay informed about important decisions while giving your student appropriate independence.\n\nNavigate to the \"Approvals\" tab in the top menu to access this section. Here, you'll find pending requests organized by category: academic (course changes, test retakes), extracurricular (field trips, club participation), and administrative (information release forms, policy acknowledgments).\n\nEach approval request includes detailed information about what you're authorizing, any associated costs, deadlines, and contact information for questions. To approve or deny a request, simply select the appropriate button and add any comments if needed. The system maintains a complete history of all approvals, which you can filter by date, type, or status for easy reference.\n\n## Progress Monitoring\n\nThe Progress Monitoring section provides comprehensive visibility into your student's academic journey, allowing you to celebrate successes and identify areas where additional support might be needed.\n\nAccess this feature by clicking on the \"Progress\" tab in the main navigation. The dashboard presents an overview of your student's current courses, grades, assignment completion rates, and attendance records. Color-coded indicators make it easy to quickly assess status \u2013 green for on-track, yellow for areas needing attention, and red for immediate concerns.\n\nFor a deeper dive into any course, simply click on the course name to view detailed information about individual assignments, upcoming due dates, and teacher feedback. The progress section also includes a calendar view that displays upcoming assignments, tests, and project deadlines across all courses, helping you and your student plan effectively.\n\nOne particularly useful feature is the ability to set up custom alerts for grade thresholds, missing assignments, or attendance issues, ensuring you're promptly notified about matters requiring your attention.\n\nBy regularly utilizing these three core features of the Excel High School Parent Portal, you'll establish a strong foundation for supporting your student's educational journey while fostering the independence they need to grow academically.\n</educational_content>",
