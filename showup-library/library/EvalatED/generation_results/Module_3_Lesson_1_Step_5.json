Today, we'll work together to navigate a realistic situation where you might be tempted to use AI in ways that could potentially violate academic integrity policies. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into education, understanding how to use AI tools ethically is an essential skill. In previous lessons, we explored Excel High School's academic integrity policies and the appropriate uses of AI tools. Now, we'll apply that knowledge to a specific case study, making decisions together about the ethical boundaries of using AI feedback in your coursework. This collaborative exercise will help you develop critical thinking skills for making sound ethical judgments when working with AI tools in your academic journey.\n\n## The Scenario: History Essay Assignment\n\n### Setting the Stage\n\nYour history teacher has assigned a 1,000-word analytical essay on the causes of World War I. The assignment requires you to:\n- Analyze at least three major causes of the war\n- Support your analysis with specific historical evidence\n- Develop an original thesis statement\n- Include proper citations using MLA format\n\nYou've been researching the topic and have gathered some information, but you're struggling with organizing your thoughts and developing a compelling thesis. You decide to use an AI tool to help you with your assignment.\n\n## Decision Point 1: Initial Research Support\n\nYou're considering using ChatGPT to help you understand the complex historical factors that led to World War I.\n\n**Option A:** Ask ChatGPT: \"Write me a 1,000-word essay on the causes of World War I with an original thesis and MLA citations.\"\n\n**Option B:** Ask ChatGPT: \"Can you explain the major causes of World War I in simple terms? I'm trying to understand the relationships between nationalism, militarism, and alliance systems.\"\n\n**Let's Analyze Together:**\n\nOption A requests the AI to complete the entire assignment for you. This would be a clear violation of academic integrity as you would be submitting work that isn't your own.\n\nOption B uses AI as a learning tool to help clarify complex concepts. This is similar to consulting an encyclopedia or asking a tutor for an explanation. You're still responsible for writing your own analysis and forming your own thesis.\n\n**Class Decision:** Option B represents an ethical use of AI. It's similar to using any other reference material to better understand your topic.\n\n## Decision Point 2: Developing Your Thesis\n\nYou've done your research and understand the major causes, but you're struggling to develop a compelling thesis statement.\n\n**Option A:** Ask ChatGPT: \"Based on my understanding that nationalism, militarism, and alliance systems contributed to WWI, can you help me brainstorm some potential thesis angles that I could explore in my essay?\"\n\n**Option B:** Ask ChatGPT: \"Give me a strong thesis statement about the causes of World War I that I can use in my essay.\"\n\n**Let's Analyze Together:**\n\nOption A asks the AI to help you brainstorm potential approaches based on your own understanding. You're still developing the final thesis yourself and using AI as a thought partner.\n\nOption B asks for a complete thesis that you would directly use without modification. This would mean presenting someone else's ideas as your own.\n\n**Class Decision:** Option A represents ethical use of AI as a brainstorming tool. It's similar to discussing ideas with a classmate or teacher to refine your thinking, but you'll still craft your own thesis.\n\n## Decision Point 3: Refining Your Writing\n\nYou've written a first draft of your essay, but you're not confident about your writing style and grammar.\n\n**Option A:** Submit your entire draft to ChatGPT with the prompt: \"Can you review this essay for grammar, clarity, and flow? Please suggest specific improvements but don't rewrite it completely.\"\n\n**Option B:** Ask ChatGPT: \"Rewrite this paragraph to make it sound more sophisticated and academic,\" and then copy the improved version directly into your final essay.\n\n**Let's Analyze Together:**\n\nOption A uses AI as an editing tool, similar to using Grammarly or asking a peer for feedback. You're still responsible for making the final decisions about what changes to implement.\n\nOption B asks the AI to generate new content that you would present as your own without understanding the changes or why they improve the writing.\n\n**Class Decision:** Option A represents ethical use of AI as a feedback tool. Using AI to help identify areas for improvement is acceptable as long as you understand the suggestions and implement them yourself.\n\n## Final Reflection\n\nThrough this guided scenario, we've explored how to make ethical decisions about using AI in your academic work. The key principles we've identified include:\n\n1. Use AI to enhance your understanding, not to replace your own thinking\n2. Always acknowledge any assistance you receive, whether from AI or human sources\n3. Ensure that the final work represents your own ideas and understanding\n4. When in doubt, ask your teacher about acceptable uses of AI for specific assignments\n\nRemember that the goal of education is to develop your own skills and understanding. AI tools can be valuable resources when used ethically, but they should support\u2014not replace\u2014your learning process.\n\nWhat other scenarios might you encounter where you'd need to make ethical decisions about using AI in your coursework? How would you apply the principles we've discussed today?\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Ethical Scenario Walk-through (We Do)\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to our guided case study on ethical AI usage! In today's digital learning environment, artificial intelligence tools offer powerful assistance for academic work. However, using these tools responsibly requires careful consideration of academic integrity policies. Today, we'll work through a realistic scenario together, analyzing how to ethically incorporate AI feedback into your assignments without crossing ethical boundaries. This exercise builds on our previous discussions about Excel High School's academic integrity policies and will help you develop a framework for making sound ethical decisions when using AI tools in your coursework. By the end of this walk-through, you'll have practiced applying ethical principles to real academic situations.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Identifying the Ethical Dilemma\n\nLet's begin with our case study scenario:\n\n**Scenario: Research Paper Feedback**\n*Jamie is working on a 5-page research paper for History class about the Civil Rights Movement. After struggling with organization and clarity in the first draft, Jamie decides to use an AI writing assistant. Jamie inputs the entire draft and asks the AI to \"improve this paper and make it better.\"*\n\nBefore we determine what Jamie should do, let's identify the potential ethical issues at play. When using AI for academic work, we need to consider:\n\n1. The purpose of the assignment (what skills is it meant to develop?)\n2. The level of contribution from the AI (minor editing vs. substantial rewriting)\n3. The school's specific policies on AI usage\n4. Whether the AI contribution is being properly acknowledged\n\nIn Jamie's case, asking the AI to broadly \"improve\" the paper without specific guidance could result in the AI substantially rewriting content, potentially crossing from legitimate assistance into academic dishonesty. The vague instruction doesn't set appropriate boundaries for the AI's contribution.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Evaluating Alternative Approaches\n\nNow that we've identified the ethical concerns in Jamie's approach, let's explore better alternatives. When using AI tools, it's helpful to:\n\n1. **Be specific with prompts** - Request targeted feedback rather than general improvements\n2. **Maintain authorial control** - Use AI as a consultant, not a co-author\n3. **Focus on process improvement** - Use AI to learn how to improve your skills\n4. **Practice transparency** - Be prepared to disclose how AI was used\n\nLet's consider how Jamie might revise the approach:\n\n**Alternative 1:** Jamie could ask the AI specific questions like \"Can you help me identify places where my paragraph transitions are weak?\" or \"Is my thesis statement clear and supported throughout the paper?\"\n\n**Alternative 2:** Jamie could request feedback on a particular section rather than the entire paper, maintaining more control over the final product.\n\n**Alternative 3:** Jamie could ask the AI to explain principles of good organization rather than directly editing the paper, then apply those principles independently.\n\nWhich of these approaches do you think best maintains academic integrity while still benefiting from AI assistance? [Pause for class discussion]\n\n## Core Concept 3: Making and Justifying Ethical Decisions\n\nAfter considering our options, let's develop a revised approach for Jamie that aligns with ethical standards:\n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n1. Jamie should first review Excel High School's specific policies on AI usage for assignments\n2. Rather than submitting the entire paper, Jamie should ask the AI specific questions about structure, clarity, or grammar\n3. Jamie should use the AI's suggestions as guidance, implementing changes independently\n4. If required by school policy, Jamie should disclose the use of AI assistance to the teacher\n\nThis approach maintains Jamie as the primary author while using AI as a learning tool rather than a replacement for developing writing skills. It respects the educational purpose of the assignment while still benefiting from technological assistance.\n\nLet's practice articulating why this approach is ethically sound:\n- It preserves the learning objectives of the assignment\n- It uses AI as a tool for improvement rather than outsourcing the work\n- It maintains transparency about the assistance received\n- It helps Jamie develop both writing skills and ethical decision-making\n\n## Application Exercise\n\nNow, let's apply what we've learned to modify Jamie's original prompt. Working together as a class, how might we rewrite Jamie's request to the AI to make it more ethically sound?\n\nOriginal: \"Improve this paper and make it better.\"\n\nPossible ethical revisions:\n- \"Can you identify three areas where my paragraph organization could be improved?\"\n- \"Please review my introduction and suggest ways to make my thesis statement clearer.\"\n- \"What grammatical patterns do you notice that I should work on improving?\"\n\n[Class discussion to refine these prompts]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough this guided case study, we've practiced identifying ethical concerns when using AI for academic work, evaluated alternative approaches, and developed guidelines for responsible AI usage. Remember that the goal of your education at Excel High School is to develop your skills and knowledge. AI tools can support that journey when used ethically, but they should enhance rather than replace your learning process. As you encounter your own situations requiring ethical judgment, apply the framework we've practiced today: identify the ethical concerns, consider alternatives, and choose approaches that maintain academic integrity while maximizing learning opportunities.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Ethical Scenario Walk-through (We do)\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to our guided ethical scenario analysis! Today, we'll work together through a case study that addresses a common challenge students face: how to ethically incorporate AI feedback into your academic work. As technology evolves, so do the ethical questions surrounding its use in education. This walk-through will help you develop a framework for making sound ethical decisions about AI use that align with Excel High School's academic integrity policies. By analyzing this scenario together, you'll strengthen your critical thinking skills and learn to navigate the sometimes blurry line between helpful technological assistance and academic dishonesty.\n\n## Case Study: \"The Research Paper Dilemma\"\n\n### Scenario Background\n\nJamie is a junior at Excel High School working on a research paper for History class. The assignment requires:\n- A 5-page analysis of the causes and effects of a significant historical event\n- At least 5 credible sources\n- Original analysis and commentary\n- Proper citations in MLA format\n\nJamie has been struggling with organizing thoughts and developing a compelling thesis statement. A classmate suggests using an AI writing assistant to help with the paper.\n\n## Analysis Phase 1: Understanding AI Capabilities and Limitations\n\nLet's first consider what AI tools can do and how they might be used in this scenario:\n\n**AI Writing Capabilities:**\n- Generate ideas and suggest organizational structures\n- Help refine thesis statements and arguments\n- Provide feedback on grammar and style\n- Create citations in proper format\n- Generate complete paragraphs or even entire essays\n\n**Questions to Consider:**\n1. What specific challenges is Jamie facing with the assignment?\n2. Which of these AI capabilities might address those challenges?\n3. Which capabilities might cross the line into academic dishonesty?\n\n*Teacher-led discussion: Let's identify together where Jamie's specific needs align with appropriate AI assistance versus where they might lead to policy violations.*\n\n## Analysis Phase 2: Reviewing the Academic Integrity Policy\n\nNow let's examine Excel High School's academic integrity policy as it relates to AI use:\n\n**Key Policy Elements:**\n- Work submitted must represent the student's own efforts and understanding\n- Outside assistance must be acknowledged appropriately\n- Proper citation is required for all source material\n- The use of technological tools to bypass learning is prohibited\n- The process of creating work is as important as the final product\n\n*Teacher-led discussion: How do these policy elements apply to Jamie's situation? What specific guidance do they provide about using AI tools?*\n\n## Analysis Phase 3: Making Ethical Decisions\n\nLet's develop a plan for how Jamie could use AI assistance ethically:\n\n**Ethical Applications of AI:**\n- Using AI to brainstorm initial ideas, but developing them independently\n- Getting AI feedback on grammar and style in Jamie's original writing\n- Using AI to help format citations for sources Jamie has actually read\n- Having AI suggest organizational structures but creating the outline independently\n\n**Unethical Applications of AI:**\n- Having AI generate the entire paper or complete sections\n- Using AI-generated analysis without understanding it\n- Incorporating AI-suggested sources without evaluating them\n- Not acknowledging AI assistance when it substantially shaped the work\n\n*Teacher-led discussion: What's your reasoning for categorizing these applications as ethical or unethical? Are there gray areas we should explore further?*\n\n## Decision Framework\n\nBased on our analysis, let's create a decision framework Jamie could use:\n\n1. **Identify the learning objectives** - What skills is this assignment meant to develop?\n2. **Assess personal knowledge gaps** - Where specifically is help needed?\n3. **Consider appropriate AI applications** - Which AI functions support learning rather than replace it?\n4. **Plan for transparency** - How will AI use be disclosed to the teacher?\n5. **Apply the \"learning integrity\" test** - Is the process building genuine skills and knowledge?\n\n*Teacher-led application: Let's apply this framework to Jamie's specific situation and develop a plan that supports learning while maintaining academic integrity.*\n\n## Conclusion: Jamie's Ethical Path Forward\n\nAfter our analysis, we've determined that Jamie could ethically:\n- Use AI to help brainstorm potential thesis statements, then choose and refine one independently\n- Submit drafts to AI for grammar and style feedback, but make revisions personally\n- Use AI to help organize thoughts into a coherent outline, then write the paper independently\n- Have AI help format citations for sources Jamie has actually read and understood\n- Disclose to the teacher how AI was used in the process\n\nThis approach allows Jamie to benefit from technological assistance while still developing essential research, writing, and analytical skills. Most importantly, the final paper will genuinely represent Jamie's own work and learning.\n\n*Final reflection: What other scenarios might you encounter where you'll need to make similar ethical decisions about AI use? How will you apply this decision framework to those situations?*\n</educational_content>"
