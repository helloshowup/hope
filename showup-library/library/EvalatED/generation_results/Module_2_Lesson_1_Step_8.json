What resulted from this new relationship?\n\n4. **Lessons Learned**: What did this experience teach you about the role of communication in networking? What would you do the same or differently next time?\n\n### Example Response Structure\n\nWhile your experience will be unique, here's how you might structure your response:\n\n\"At [event/situation], I needed to [goal].
