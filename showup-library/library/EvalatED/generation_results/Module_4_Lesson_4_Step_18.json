    "<educational_content>\n# Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections\n\nIn this activity, you'll work in groups of three to exchange and evaluate each other's reflections, specifically identifying evidence of growth in your peers' work.\n\n## Process:\n\n1. **Exchange Reflections**: Share your completed reflection with the other two members of your triad.\n\n2. **Review & Analyze**: As you read your peers' reflections, look specifically for evidence of:\n   - Clear connections between experiences and learning\n   - Specific examples demonstrating growth\n   - Thoughtful self-assessment\n   - Application of course concepts\n\n3. **Provide Feedback**: For each reflection you review, highlight at least 2-3 specific examples where you see evidence of growth or learning. Use the \"Comment\" feature to tag these moments with constructive feedback.\n\n4. **Discuss Together**: After individual reviews, meet as a triad to discuss the patterns of growth you observed across all reflections and how this peer review process deepened your understanding of the reflection process itself.\n\nThis collaborative evaluation helps you develop critical analysis skills while gaining new perspectives on your own learning journey.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections\n\nIn this activity, you'll work in groups of three to provide meaningful feedback on each other's reflections. This collaborative process helps deepen understanding through critical evaluation of peers' work.\n\n## Process:\n1. Exchange your reflections with your triad members\n2. Read each reflection carefully, looking specifically for evidence of growth and learning\n3. Provide constructive feedback by \"tagging\" specific sentences or paragraphs that demonstrate:\n   - Clear self-awareness\n   - Specific examples of skill development\n   - Thoughtful connections between concepts\n   - Areas where additional reflection could strengthen understanding\n\nWhen providing feedback, use the \"I notice...\" and \"I wonder...\" format to frame your observations constructively. For example: \"I notice you provided strong evidence of growth in your time management skills. I wonder how these skills might transfer to other courses?\"\n\nThis peer review process helps you develop critical thinking skills while gaining new perspectives on your own learning journey.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections\n\nIn this activity, you'll work in groups of three to evaluate and provide feedback on each other's reflections, focusing specifically on identifying evidence of growth.\n\n## How It Works:\n1. Each member of your triad will share their written reflection with the other two members.\n2. As you review your peers' reflections, look for specific examples that demonstrate growth in understanding, skills, or perspective.\n3. Use the \"tagging\" method - highlight or comment on specific sentences or paragraphs where you see evidence of growth.\n4. Provide constructive feedback that is specific, actionable, and supportive.\n\n## Why This Matters:\nBy critically analyzing others' reflections, you'll develop a deeper understanding of what meaningful reflection looks like. This process helps you recognize patterns of growth that you might apply to your own learning journey. The collaborative nature of this exercise creates a supportive community of learners who help each other progress through thoughtful critique.\n\nWhen providing feedback, remember to be respectful, specific, and growth-oriented.\n</educational_content>"
