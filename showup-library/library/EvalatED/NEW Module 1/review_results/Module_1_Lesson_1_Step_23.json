  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance the content for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Added a specific placeholder for the deadline with format and time zone for clarity\n2. Removed the vague \"designated submission link below\" and replaced it with clear instructions to use the \"Submit Assignment\" button\n3. Added a \"Success Tips\" section with targeted advice for different learner segments from the profile\n4. Included a reference to the BRYTE AI Tutor as a support resource\n5. Added a \"Need Help?\" section at the end with specific Excel High School support options (Success Coach, Writing Lab)\n6. Maintained the overall structure while making the content more specific to Excel's asynchronous learning environment\n7. Ensured language is appropriate for all age groups in the learner profile\n\nThese changes make the instructions more specific to Excel High School's systems, provide differentiated guidance for various learner segments, and incorporate the available support resources mentioned in the learner profile."
