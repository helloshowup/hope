By exchanging goals with a classmate, you gain fresh perspectives that can help identify blind spots, strengthen weak areas, and enhance overall goal quality. This collaborative process not only improves your goals but also builds community connections and develops your critical thinking skills as you provide feedback to others.\n\n## The Peer Review Process\n\n### Step 1: Exchange Goals\nPartner with a classmate and exchange your SMART goals. Take time to thoroughly read and understand their goals before providing feedback.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Use the Excel High School discussion forums or messaging system to connect with a peer if you're completing this course asynchronously.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Using the SMART Criteria\nWhen reviewing your peer's goals, assess them against each SMART criterion:\n- **Specific**: Is the goal clear and well-defined? Does it answer who, what, where, when, and why?\n- **Measurable**: Are there concrete metrics to track progress? How will they know when the goal is achieved?\n- **Achievable**: Is the goal realistic given available resources and constraints?\n- **Relevant**: Does this goal align with broader objectives and priorities?\n- **Time-bound**: Is there a clear deadline or timeframe?\n\n### Step 3: Provide Actionable Feedback\nEffective feedback is:\n- **Specific**: Point to exact elements that need improvement\n- **Constructive**: Suggest concrete ways to strengthen the goal\n- **Balanced**: Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement\n- **Respectful**: Phrase feedback thoughtfully and supportively\n\n**Example feedback:** \"Your goal to 'improve math skills' could be more specific by identifying which math concepts you want to master. Consider changing it to 'master quadratic equations by completing 20 practice problems with 90% accuracy by October 15th.'\"\n\n**Feedback Template:**\n```\nStrengths of your SMART goal:\n\u2022 [List 1-2 strong elements]\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\u2022 Specific: [Comment on specificity]\n\u2022 Measurable: [Comment on measurement]\n\u2022 Achievable: [Comment on achievability]\n\u2022 Relevant: [Comment on relevance]\n\u2022 Time-bound: [Comment on timeframe]\n\nMy revised version of your goal might look like:\n[Provide a sample revision if helpful]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement Improvements\nAfter receiving feedback, revise your goals accordingly. Consider each suggestion carefully, but remember that you make the final decision about which changes to implement.\n\n### Step 5: Reflect on the Process\nTake a moment to consider:\n- How did the peer review process change your understanding of SMART goals?\n- Which feedback was most valuable to you and why?\n- How might you apply this collaborative approach to other areas of your academic journey?\n\nRemember: The purpose of peer review isn't criticism but collaboration toward excellence. Approach the process with openness and appreciation for your peer's insights.\n\n## Submission Requirements\n- Your original SMART goal\n- The feedback you received from your peer\n- Your revised SMART goal\n- A brief reflection (100-150 words) on how the peer review process improved your goal-setting skills",
  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the content for Excel High School's asynchronous learners:\n\n1. Added a \"Pro Tip\" about how to connect with peers in an asynchronous environment, addressing a key challenge for online students.\n\n2. Included a structured feedback template to guide students in providing comprehensive, organized feedback.\n\n3. Added a fifth step focused on reflection, encouraging metacognition about the peer review process.\n\n4. Added clear submission requirements at the end to set expectations for the assignment.\n\n5. Expanded the example feedback to be more concrete and actionable.\n\nThese changes support Excel's instructional design drivers by:\n- Enhancing self-direction aids with clearer structure\n- Supporting flexibility with structure through templates and clear expectations\n- Fostering community and presence through guided peer interaction\n- Incorporating reflection to deepen learning and support mastery"
