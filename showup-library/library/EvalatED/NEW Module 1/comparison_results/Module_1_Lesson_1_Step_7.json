This collaborative process will help you better understand each component of effective goal-setting.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Form pairs with another student\n2. Review the vague goal example provided below\n3. Work together to transform it into a SMART goal\n4. Be prepared to share your revised goal with the class\n\n### Example Vague Goal:\n\n**\"I want to improve my grades.\"**\n\nThis goal lacks specificity, measurability, and a timeframe. Let's transform it together!\n\n### Collaborative Transformation Process:\n\n1. **Make it Specific**: Discuss which subject needs improvement and by how much\n   - *Example discussion question*: \"Which specific subject are you struggling with most?\"\n\n2. **Add Measurability**: Determine how progress will be tracked\n   - *Example discussion question*: \"What grade would represent success for you?\"\n\n3. **Ensure it's Achievable**: Consider current performance and realistic improvement\n   - *Example discussion question*: \"Based on your current grade, what improvement is realistic?\"\n\n4. **Confirm Relevance**: Connect to larger educational goals\n   - *Example discussion question*: \"How will improving in this subject help your future plans?\"\n\n5. **Set a Timeframe**: Establish a deadline\n   - *Example discussion question*: \"By when do you want to achieve this improvement?\"\n\n### Sample SMART Goal Transformation:\n\n**Vague**: \"I want to improve my grades.\"\n\n**SMART**: \"I will raise my Algebra II grade from a C to a B by the end of this semester by completing all homework assignments, attending after-school tutoring twice weekly, and creating study guides for each unit test.\"\n\n### Your Turn:\n\nWith your partner, transform one of these vague goals into a SMART goal:\n1. \"I need to read more books.\"\n2. \"I should exercise more.\"\n3. \"I want to save money.\"\n\nRemember to discuss each SMART element thoroughly and be specific about actions needed to achieve the goal!",
