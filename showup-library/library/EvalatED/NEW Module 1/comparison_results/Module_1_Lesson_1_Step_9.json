By exchanging goals with a classmate, you gain fresh perspectives that can help identify blind spots, strengthen weak areas, and enhance overall goal quality. This collaborative process not only improves your goals but also builds community connections and develops your critical thinking skills as you provide feedback to others.\n\n## The Peer Review Process\n\n### Step 1: Exchange Goals\nPartner with a classmate and exchange your SMART goals. Take time to thoroughly read and understand their goals before providing feedback.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Using the SMART Criteria\nWhen reviewing your peer's goals, assess them against each SMART criterion:\n- **Specific**: Is the goal clear and well-defined? Does it answer who, what, where, when, and why?\n- **Measurable**: Are there concrete metrics to track progress? How will they know when the goal is achieved?\n- **Achievable**: Is the goal realistic given available resources and constraints?\n- **Relevant**: Does this goal align with broader objectives and priorities?\n- **Time-bound**: Is there a clear deadline or timeframe?\n\n### Step 3: Provide Actionable Feedback\nEffective feedback is:\n- **Specific**: Point to exact elements that need improvement\n- **Constructive**: Suggest concrete ways to strengthen the goal\n- **Balanced**: Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement\n- **Respectful**: Phrase feedback thoughtfully and supportively\n\nExample feedback: \"Your goal to 'improve math skills' could be more specific by identifying which math concepts you want to master. Consider changing it to 'master quadratic equations by completing 20 practice problems with 90% accuracy by October 15th.'\"\n\n### Step 4: Implement Improvements\nAfter receiving feedback, revise your goals accordingly. Consider each suggestion carefully, but remember that you make the final decision about which changes to implement.\n\nRemember: The purpose of peer review isn't criticism but collaboration toward excellence. Approach the process with openness and appreciation for your peer's insights.",
