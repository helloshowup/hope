In your journal, write about a specific time when you faced a difficult situation or obstacle and overcame it by adopting a growth mindset.\n\nConsider these questions as you write your reflection:\n\n1. What was the specific challenge you faced? Describe the situation clearly.\n\n2. What was your initial reaction to this challenge? Did you experience any negative thoughts or self-doubt?\n\n3. How did you shift from a fixed mindset (\"I can't do this\") to a growth mindset (\"I can learn to do this\")?\n\n4. What specific actions did you take to overcome the challenge?\n\n5. What resources, support, or strategies did you use to help you through this process?\n\n6. What did you learn about yourself through this experience?\n\n7. How has this experience changed how you approach new challenges?\n\nYour journal entry should be thoughtful and personal. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014this is about your authentic experience with applying a growth mindset in your life.\n\n### Tips for Success:\n* Start with a specific example rather than a general situation\n* Include both your thoughts/feelings AND your actions\n* If you're struggling to identify an example, consider challenges in:\n  - Learning a new skill\n  - Adapting to a new situation\n  - Overcoming a setback in school or work\n  - Mastering a difficult concept in a course\n\n### What is a Growth Mindset?\nA growth mindset means believing your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and learning from feedback. People with a growth mindset:\n* View challenges as opportunities\n* Persist in the face of setbacks\n* Learn from criticism\n* Find inspiration in others' success\n* Use phrases like \"I'm not good at this YET\" instead of \"I can't do this\"\n\nTake your time with this reflection. Writing about our experiences helps us process them more deeply and recognize patterns in our thinking and behavior.\n\n**Length Expectation:** 300-500 words\n**Submission Format:** Text entry or document upload",
