# Crafting a SMART Goal Together

# Crafting a SMART Goal Together

## Partner Activity: Converting Vague Goals to SMART Goals

In this activity, you'll work with a partner to transform unclear goals into SMART goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This collaborative process will help you better understand each component of effective goal-setting.

### Instructions:

1. Form pairs with another student in your Excel High School online course
2. Connect via the course messaging system or use the recommended collaboration tools
3. Review the vague goal example provided below
4. Work together to transform it into a SMART goal
5. Submit your revised goal through the assignment portal by the due date

### Example Vague Goal:

**"I want to improve my grades."**

This goal lacks specificity, measurability, and a timeframe. Let's transform it together!

### Collaborative Transformation Process:

1. **Make it Specific**: Discuss which subject needs improvement and by how much
   - *Example discussion question*: "Which specific subject are you struggling with most?"

2. **Add Measurability**: Determine how progress will be tracked
   - *Example discussion question*: "What grade would represent success for you?"

3. **Ensure it's Achievable**: Consider current performance and realistic improvement
   - *Example discussion question*: "Based on your current grade, what improvement is realistic?"

4. **Confirm Relevance**: Connect to larger educational goals
   - *Example discussion question*: "How will improving in this subject help your future plans?"

5. **Set a Timeframe**: Establish a deadline
   - *Example discussion question*: "By when do you want to achieve this improvement?"

### Sample SMART Goal Transformation:

**Vague**: "I want to improve my grades."

**SMART**: "I will raise my Algebra II grade from a C to a B by the end of this semester by completing all homework assignments, attending after-school tutoring twice weekly, and creating study guides for each unit test."

### Your Turn:

With your partner, transform one of these vague goals into a SMART goal:
1. "I need to read more books."
2. "I should exercise more."
3. "I want to save money."
4. "I want to improve my time management for online courses."

**Collaboration Tips for Online Learning:**
* Schedule a specific time to meet virtually
* Use shared documents to draft your SMART goal together
* If synchronous collaboration is difficult due to schedules, consider using the discussion board to post drafts and provide feedback
* Remember that BRYTE AI Tutor is available if you need additional guidance

**Submission Requirements:**
* Your final SMART goal
* A brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of how each SMART element is addressed
* A short reflection on how this goal-setting process might help you in your Excel High School courses

Remember to discuss each SMART element thoroughly and be specific about actions needed to achieve the goal!
