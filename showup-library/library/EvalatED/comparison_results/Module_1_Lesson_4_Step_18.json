When we share our reflections with peers and receive thoughtful feedback, we gain new perspectives and insights that might otherwise remain hidden. This peer feedback loop creates a powerful mechanism for deepening understanding and accelerating personal development. In this activity, you'll work in triads to exchange reflections and identify evidence of growth in each other's work.\n\n## The Value of Peer Feedback\nPeer feedback transforms individual reflection into collaborative learning. When you review a classmate's reflection, you not only help them see blind spots in their thinking, but you also strengthen your own analytical skills. By identifying evidence of growth in others' work, you develop a keener eye for recognizing progress in your own learning journey.\n\nThe process of giving and receiving feedback builds critical communication skills that extend far beyond the classroom. In professional settings, the ability to provide constructive, evidence-based feedback is highly valued, as is the capacity to receive feedback with openness and apply it meaningfully.\n\n## How the Triad Exchange Works\nIn your assigned triad group, you'll exchange your written reflections with two peers. Each member will:\n\n1. **Read carefully**: Review both peers' reflections thoroughly, noting specific examples of growth, insight, or learning.\n\n2. **Tag evidence**: Identify and highlight at least three specific statements or passages that demonstrate growth. Use comments or annotations to explain why these represent development.\n\n3. **Ask questions**: Pose at least two thoughtful questions that might help your peer extend their thinking or consider new perspectives.\n\n4. **Provide constructive feedback**: Offer specific suggestions for how the reflection could be strengthened, focusing on content rather than mechanics.\n\n5. **Acknowledge strengths**: Highlight what was particularly effective or insightful about the reflection.\n\nWhen receiving feedback, listen openly and resist the urge to defend or explain. The goal is not to justify your reflection but to gain new insights from how others perceive your work.\n\nRemember that effective feedback is specific, actionable, and balanced. Vague comments like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement\" offer little value. Instead, point to particular statements and explain their impact or potential for enhancement.\n\nThrough this structured exchange, you'll develop a deeper understanding of both the content you're reflecting on and the reflection process itself.",
