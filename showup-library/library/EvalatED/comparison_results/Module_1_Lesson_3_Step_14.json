In this activity, you'll finalize your weekly schedule by setting SMART goals and incorporating Focusmate sessions to maintain productivity. This personal balanced plan will serve as your roadmap for success at Excel High School, helping you transform good intentions into measurable progress.\n\n## Setting SMART Goals for Your Weekly Schedule\n\nSMART goals provide structure and trackability to your academic plans. As you finalize your weekly schedule, ensure each goal meets these criteria:\n\n- **Specific**: Clearly define what you aim to accomplish\n- **Measurable**: Include concrete criteria to track progress\n- **Achievable**: Set realistic goals within your capabilities\n- **Relevant**: Ensure goals align with your academic priorities\n- **Time-bound**: Establish deadlines for completion\n\nFor example, instead of \"Study more math,\" a SMART goal would be: \"Complete 20 practice problems from Chapter 3 by Thursday at 6 PM, scoring at least 80%.\"\n\n## Incorporating Focusmate Sessions\n\nFocusmate provides structured accountability through virtual co-working sessions. As you finalize your weekly schedule:\n\n1. Identify your most challenging or procrastination-prone tasks\n2. Schedule 2-3 Focusmate sessions specifically for these tasks\n3. Place these sessions at times when your energy levels match task demands\n4. Label each session with your specific SMART goal for that time block\n\nFor example: \"Monday, 4:00-4:50 PM Focusmate: Write outline for English essay on 'The Great Gatsby'\"\n\n## Creating Your Balanced Weekly Plan\n\nNow, combine your SMART goals and Focusmate sessions into a comprehensive weekly schedule:\n\n1. Start with fixed commitments (classes, family obligations, etc.)\n2. Add your SMART goal work blocks, highlighting Focusmate sessions\n3. Ensure balance by including:\n   - Study time for each subject\n   - Breaks between intense work periods\n   - Personal time for rest and recreation\n   - Weekly review sessions to assess progress\n\nYour final schedule should be realistic, sustainable, and include accountability mechanisms. Remember that this plan is a living document\u2014review and adjust it weekly based on your experiences and changing priorities.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Finalize your weekly schedule with at least 3-5 SMART goals\n2. Schedule your Focusmate sessions for the coming week\n3. Commit to following your plan for one full week\n4. Reflect on what worked and what needs adjustment",
