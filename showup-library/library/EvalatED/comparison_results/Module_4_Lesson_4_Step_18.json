  "best_version": "# Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections\n\nIn this activity, you'll work in groups of three to provide meaningful feedback on each other's reflections. This collaborative process helps deepen understanding through critical evaluation of peers' work.\n\n## Process:\n1. Exchange your reflections with your triad members\n2. Read each reflection carefully, looking specifically for evidence of growth and learning\n3. Provide constructive feedback by \"tagging\" specific sentences or paragraphs that demonstrate:\n   - Clear self-awareness\n   - Specific examples of skill development\n   - Thoughtful connections between concepts\n   - Areas where additional reflection could strengthen understanding\n\nWhen providing feedback, use the \"I notice...\" and \"I wonder...\" format to frame your observations constructively. For example: \"I notice you provided strong evidence of growth in your time management skills. I wonder how these skills might transfer to other courses?\"\n\nThis peer review process helps you develop critical thinking skills while gaining new perspectives on your own learning journey.",
