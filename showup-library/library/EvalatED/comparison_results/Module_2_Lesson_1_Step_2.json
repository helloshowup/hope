This activity helps reinforce your understanding of the BC_NET concept by engaging in meaningful discussion with peers.\n\n### Instructions for Small Group Discussion\n\n1. Form small groups of 3-4 students as directed by your instructor.\n\n2. Each group should have a copy of the One Pager document to review together.\n\n3. As a group, carefully read through the One Pager, paying special attention to:\n   - Main concepts related to connections\n   - Supporting evidence or examples\n   - Practical applications of these ideas\n\n4. Using highlighters or digital annotation tools, mark passages that your group identifies as particularly significant.\n\n5. Discuss with your group members why these points stand out. Consider:\n   - How does this point help clarify the concept of connections?\n   - Why is this information essential to understanding the bigger picture?\n   - How might this point apply to real-world situations?\n\n6. Through your discussion, reach a consensus on the **top three takeaways** from the One Pager.\n\n7. For each of your top three takeaways:\n   - Highlight the relevant text on your One Pager\n   - Write a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) about why your group selected this point\n   - Consider how this point connects to other concepts you've learned\n\n8. Prepare to share your group's top three takeaways with the class. Select a spokesperson who can explain:\n   - What points your group highlighted\n   - Why these points were deemed most significant\n   - How these points relate to the overall concept of connections\n\n### Tips for Productive Group Discussion\n\n- Listen actively to all group members' perspectives\n- Build on each other's ideas rather than dismissing them\n- Ask clarifying questions if someone's point isn't clear\n- Connect the content to your own experiences when relevant\n- Focus on understanding the material deeply rather than just completing the task\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nThis collaborative annotation exercise helps you process information more deeply through discussion and analysis. By identifying key points together, you'll gain multiple perspectives on the material and strengthen your understanding of connections as a concept. The skills you practice here\u2014critical reading, collaborative discussion, and prioritizing information\u2014are valuable across all academic disciplines and professional settings.\n\nBe prepared to share your group's insights during the whole-class discussion that follows.",
