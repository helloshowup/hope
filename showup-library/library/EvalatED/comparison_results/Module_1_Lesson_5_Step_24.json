This plan ensures everyone is on the same page regarding timeline expectations, necessary resources, and safety considerations. By working together to complete this plan, students and parents establish clear communication and shared responsibility for the service learning project.\n\n## Creating Your Joint Service Plan\n\n### Timeline Planning\nTogether with your parent or guardian, establish a realistic timeline for your service project:\n\n* **Start and End Dates**: Determine when your service will begin and when it should conclude.\n* **Milestone Checkpoints**: Identify key points to assess progress (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% completion).\n* **Weekly Time Commitment**: Decide how many hours per week you'll dedicate to service.\n* **Scheduling Considerations**: Account for other commitments like school assignments, family events, or extracurricular activities.\n\n### Resource Identification\nList all resources needed to successfully complete your service project:\n\n* **Materials and Supplies**: What physical items will you need?\n* **Transportation**: How will you get to and from your service location?\n* **Financial Resources**: Will there be any costs associated with your service?\n* **Support Network**: Who can you turn to for guidance or assistance?\n* **Technology Needs**: What digital tools or access might be required?\n\n### Safety Checklist\nCreate a comprehensive safety plan with your parent/guardian:\n\n* **Location Safety**: Assess the safety of where you'll be performing service.\n* **Adult Supervision**: Determine what level of supervision is appropriate.\n* **Emergency Contacts**: List primary and secondary contacts in case of emergency.\n* **Health Considerations**: Note any relevant health concerns or medications.\n* **Communication Plan**: Establish how and when you'll check in during service activities.\n* **Weather/Environmental Factors**: Plan for potential environmental challenges.\n\n### Finalizing Your Plan\nOnce you've completed all sections of your Joint Service Plan:\n1. Review the document together to ensure nothing has been overlooked\n2. Both student and parent/guardian should sign and date the plan\n3. Keep a copy accessible for reference throughout your service project\n4. Submit a copy to your Excel High School advisor as required\n\nRemember, this plan is a living document. As circumstances change, you may need to revisit and adjust elements of your plan with your parent/guardian's input and approval.",
