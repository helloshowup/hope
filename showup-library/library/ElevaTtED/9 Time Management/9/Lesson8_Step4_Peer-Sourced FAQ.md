# Peer-Sourced FAQ

# Peer-Sourced FAQ: Creating a Collaborative Resource

## Overview
In this activity, you will create a valuable peer-sourced FAQ document that compiles the most common questions and answers about time management from your fellow students. This resource will serve as a reference guide for your entire cohort and help everyone improve their organizational skills—a critical success factor for asynchronous learning at Excel High School.

## Learning Objectives
- Collect and organize peer knowledge about time management
- Create a concise, user-friendly reference document
- Share resources that support effective time management strategies
- Apply collaborative learning techniques to solve common challenges

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Gather Questions and Answers
1. Create a simple survey using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms to collect:
   - Common time management challenges students face in an asynchronous environment
   - Questions about organizing coursework effectively across multiple Excel High School courses
   - Successful strategies students have implemented to stay on track
   - Resources students have found helpful for balancing school with other responsibilities

2. Share the survey with your cohort and set a deadline for responses (recommended: 3-5 days).

### Step 2: Analyze and Select Content
1. Review all submissions and identify patterns in the questions.
2. Select the top ten most frequently asked questions.
3. For each question, craft a clear, concise answer (2-3 sentences) based on peer responses.
4. Identify 1-2 resource links for each question that provide additional information.
   - **Tip**: Include at least one Excel High School resource (such as the Success Coach Pro or Writing Lab) where applicable.

### Step 3: Design Your FAQ Document
1. Create a PDF document with:
   - A clear title: "Peer-Sourced Time Management FAQ for Excel High School Students"
   - A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document
   - The top ten questions with their answers
   - Resource links organized by topic
   - Acknowledgment of contributors (with permission)
   - Contact information for further questions

2. Format tips:
   - Use headings to organize content
   - Include a table of contents with clickable links
   - Use bullet points for clarity
   - Add visual elements like icons to highlight key points
   - Ensure consistent formatting throughout
   - Keep accessibility in mind—use alt text for images and maintain good color contrast

### Step 4: Share and Implement
1. Share the completed PDF with your instructor for review through your Student Portal.
2. Distribute the approved document to your entire cohort.
3. Consider creating a brief 2-3 minute video highlighting the top three time management strategies.
4. Collect feedback for potential updates to the document using a simple rating system (1-5 stars).

## Assessment
Your peer-sourced FAQ will be evaluated based on:
- Comprehensiveness of questions and answers
- Quality and relevance of resource links
- Organization and visual design of the PDF
- Usefulness to the cohort as reported in feedback
- Application of time management strategies to Excel High School's asynchronous learning environment

## Extension Activities
- Create a "Time Management Success Stories" companion document that highlights specific strategies that worked well for your peers, complete with concrete examples and implementation tips.
- Design a weekly time management template specifically for Excel High School courses that students can customize.
- Develop a set of digital badges that recognize different time management skills that can be shared in the student community.
