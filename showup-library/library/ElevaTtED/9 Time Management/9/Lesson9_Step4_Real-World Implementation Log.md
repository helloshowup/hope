2. **Adjustment Log**:
   * What change did you make to your original plan?
   * Why did you make this adjustment?
   * How did this adjustment impact your productivity?

3. **Strategy Modifications**: Note any modifications to your time management techniques (e.g., "Changed Pomodoro intervals from 25 minutes to 35 minutes" or "Added buffer time between tasks").

**Remember**: Adjustments aren't failures—they're improvements to your system!
