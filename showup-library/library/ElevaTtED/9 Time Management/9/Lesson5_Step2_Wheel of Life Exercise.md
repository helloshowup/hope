# Wheel of Life Exercise

# Wheel of Life Exercise

## Introduction
The Wheel of Life is a powerful self-assessment tool that helps you evaluate balance across different areas of your life. This exercise will help you identify which aspects of your life need more attention and create a plan for improvement that supports your academic success at Excel High School.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Complete Your Wheel of Life Chart
1. **Create your wheel:** Either use the downloadable template provided or draw a circle and divide it into 8 equal sections (like a pizza).
2. **Label each section** with one of these life domains:
   - Academic Performance
   - Physical Health
   - Family Relationships
   - Social Connections
   - Personal Growth
   - Recreation/Hobbies
   - Mental/Emotional Wellbeing
   - Future Planning

### Step 2: Rate Each Domain
1. For each section, rate your satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 (1 = completely dissatisfied, 10 = completely satisfied).
2. Mark your rating on each section, with 1 being close to the center and 10 at the outer edge.
3. Connect the marks to create your "wheel." (See example image)

### Step 3: Identify Gaps
1. Look at your completed wheel. Is it round or bumpy?
2. Identify the domains with the lowest scores - these represent areas of imbalance.
3. Reflect on how these imbalances affect your academic performance and overall wellbeing.
4. In your journal or the provided worksheet, write down 1-2 observations about what your wheel reveals.

### Step 4: Set SMART Focus Actions
Choose one domain to focus on improving and create a SMART goal:
- **S**pecific: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
- **M**easurable: How will you track progress?
- **A**chievable: Is this realistic given your current situation?
- **R**elevant: How does this connect to your academic success?
- **T**ime-bound: Set a deadline

**Example SMART Goals:**
- "To improve my Physical Health domain (currently a 4/10), I will exercise for 30 minutes three times per week for the next month."
- "To enhance my Academic Performance domain (currently a 5/10), I will use the Excel High School tutoring center once weekly for the next three weeks."

### Step 5: Implementation Plan
Create a simple action plan by answering these questions:
1. What specific weekly actions will help me reach my goal? (Break it down)
2. What obstacles might I face, and how will I overcome them?
3. How will I track my progress? (Digital tracker, journal, calendar, etc.)
4. When will I review my progress? (Set a specific date)

## Reflection Questions
Answer these questions in your journal or the provided worksheet:
- How might improving your lowest-rated domain positively impact your academic performance at Excel High School?
- What connections do you notice between different domains?
- How can you maintain balance while prioritizing your academic obligations?
- What resources at Excel High School could help you improve in your focus area?

## Submission
Submit your completed wheel and reflection responses through the assignment portal. Your Success Coach is available to discuss your results and help you refine your action plan if needed.

Remember, the Wheel of Life is a tool for awareness and growth. There's no "perfect" wheel - the goal is to find a balance that works for your unique situation and supports your academic success at Excel High School.
