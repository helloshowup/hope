# Blueprint Review Checklist

## Success Indicators for Your Time Management Blueprint

Use this self-audit checklist to ensure your blueprint for balancing academic obligations with personal interests meets all necessary criteria:

- [ ] **Clear Prioritization System**: Blueprint includes a specific method for ranking tasks by importance and urgency (Example: Eisenhower Matrix or color-coding system)
- [ ] **Realistic Time Allocation**: Schedule accounts for both academic requirements and personal activities with appropriate time blocks that reflect your actual availability and energy levels
- [ ] **Flexibility Mechanisms**: Plan includes specific strategies for adapting when unexpected events occur (such as buffer time, contingency plans, or decision trees)
- [ ] **Progress Tracking Method**: Blueprint contains a concrete system to monitor and evaluate time management effectiveness (like weekly reflection prompts or measurable success metrics)

**Auto-Pass Threshold**: Your blueprint must satisfy at least 3 of the 4 indicators to meet the minimum requirements for successful implementation.

**Self-Assessment Tips:**
* Be honest about what's realistic for your personal situation
* Consider your existing commitments when allocating time
* Remember that effective time management reduces stress, not adds to it
* Your Success Coach is available if you need guidance refining your blueprint

Review your blueprint carefully and make adjustments as needed before final submission.
