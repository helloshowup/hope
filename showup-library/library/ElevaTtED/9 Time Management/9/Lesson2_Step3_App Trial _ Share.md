# App Trial & Share

# App Trial & Share Activity

## Overview
In this activity, you will select a time management app to try for a week, document your experience, and share your insights with classmates through a micro-blog post. This exercise helps you evaluate digital tools for improving your productivity while learning from peers' experiences.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, you will:
- Evaluate digital productivity tools for personal effectiveness
- Apply time management strategies in your academic routine
- Analyze and document your experience with educational technology
- Engage in constructive peer feedback

## Micro-Blog Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Select a Time Management App
Choose one time management app to download and use for at least one week. Some suggestions include:
- Focus apps (Forest, Freedom, Focus@Will)
- Task management apps (Todoist, Microsoft To Do, TickTick)
- Time tracking apps (Toggl, RescueTime, Time Doctor)
- Pomodoro technique apps (Focus Keeper, Be Focused, Pomodoro Timer)
- Calendar/scheduling apps (Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, Any.do)

**Tip:** Choose an app that addresses a specific challenge you face in managing your study time.

### Step 2: Use the App for One Week
During your trial period:
- Use the app consistently for at least 5 days
- Take notes about what works and what doesn't
- Track any improvements in your productivity
- Save a screenshot of your progress (with no personal information)

### Step 3: Create Your Micro-Blog Post
After your trial period, create a micro-blog post that includes:

1. **App Selection Rationale** (2-3 sentences)
   - Name the app you selected
   - Explain why you chose this particular app
   - Describe what problem you hoped it would solve

2. **First-Day Challenge** (2-3 sentences)
   - Share one challenge you encountered when first using the app
   - Explain how you overcame this challenge

3. **Success Metric** (2-3 sentences)
   - Describe how you measured the app's effectiveness
   - Share specific results (e.g., "I completed 25% more homework assignments" or "My study sessions were 15 minutes longer on average")
   - State whether you'll continue using the app and why/why not

4. **Screenshot**
   - Include one screenshot showing the app in use (ensure no personal information is visible)
   - Add a brief caption explaining what the screenshot shows

5. **Tag**
   - End your post with the hashtag #ToolFeedback

### Example Micro-Blog Post:

> I selected Forest app because I'm easily distracted by my phone when studying. I wanted something that would motivate me to stay focused through positive reinforcement rather than just blocking apps.
> 
> My first-day challenge was deciding on appropriate work/break intervals. I initially set 50-minute focus sessions but found them too long. I adjusted to 25-minute sessions with 5-minute breaks, which worked much better for my attention span.
> 
> To measure success, I tracked completed focus sessions per day. Before Forest, I averaged 2 hours of focused study. With Forest, I consistently achieved 3.5 hours daily and felt less mentally drained. I'll definitely continue using it and might try the premium version for additional features.

### Commenting Guidelines

After posting your micro-blog, engage with at least two other posts by:

1. Asking at least one specific question about their experience
2. Sharing a relevant insight from your own app trial
3. Suggesting a feature or technique they might try next
4. Keeping comments constructive and supportive

**Remember:** The goal is to learn from each other's experiences, not to judge app choices or usage patterns.
