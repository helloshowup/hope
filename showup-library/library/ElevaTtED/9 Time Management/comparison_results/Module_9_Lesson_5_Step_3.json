What changes have I noticed in my stress levels and overall satisfaction?\n2. Which action steps were most effective in creating balance?\n3. What unexpected challenges arose, and how did I handle them?\n4. How might I adjust my plan for the coming weeks?\n5. What have I learned about my priorities and time management style?\n\nRemember that creating balance is an ongoing process that requires regular reflection and adjustment!",
