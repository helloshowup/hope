This exercise will help you identify which aspects of your life need more attention and create a plan for improvement.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Complete Your Wheel of Life Chart\n1. Draw a circle and divide it into 8 equal sections (like a pizza).\n2. Label each section with one of these life domains:\n   - Academic Performance\n   - Physical Health\n   - Family Relationships\n   - Social Connections\n   - Personal Growth\n   - Recreation/Hobbies\n   - Mental/Emotional Wellbeing\n   - Future Planning\n\n### Step 2: Rate Each Domain\n1. For each section, rate your satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 (1 = completely dissatisfied, 10 = completely satisfied).\n2. Mark your rating on each section, with 1 being close to the center and 10 at the outer edge.\n3. Connect the marks to create your \"wheel.\"\n\n### Step 3: Identify Gaps\n1. Look at your completed wheel. Is it round or bumpy?\n2. Identify the domains with the lowest scores - these represent areas of imbalance.\n3. Reflect on how these imbalances affect your academic performance and overall wellbeing.\n4. Write down 1-2 observations about what your wheel reveals.\n\n### Step 4: Set SMART Focus Actions\nChoose one domain to focus on improving and create a SMART goal:\n- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish\n- **Measurable**: How will you track progress?\n- **Achievable**: Is this realistic given your current situation?\n- **Relevant**: How does this connect to your academic success?\n- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline\n\nExample: \"To improve my Physical Health domain (currently a 4/10), I will exercise for 30 minutes three times per week for the next month.\"\n\n### Step 5: Implementation Plan\n1. Break your SMART goal into smaller weekly actions\n2. Identify potential obstacles and solutions\n3. Determine how you'll track progress\n4. Schedule a review date to reassess your wheel\n\n## Reflection Questions\n- How might improving your lowest-rated domain positively impact your academic performance?\n- What connections do you notice between different domains?\n- How can you maintain balance while prioritizing your academic obligations?\n\nRemember, the Wheel of Life is a tool for awareness and growth. There's no \"perfect\" wheel - the goal is to find a balance that works for your unique situation and supports your academic success.",
