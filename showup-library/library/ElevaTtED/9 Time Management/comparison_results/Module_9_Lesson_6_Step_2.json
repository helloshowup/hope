In this lesson, you'll learn how to create a customized habit tracker in Notion that will help you monitor your daily routines, visualize your progress, and stay accountable to your goals.\n\n## Setting Up Your Habit Tracker\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Database\n1. Open Notion and click the \"+ New Page\" button in the sidebar\n2. Select \"Table - Database\" from the options\n3. Name your database \"Habit Tracker\" at the top of the page\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Properties\nLet's customize your database with the right properties to track your habits effectively:\n\n1. Create a \"Habit\" property (this is your default Title column)\n2. Add a \"Category\" property (Select type) with options like:\n   - Health\n   - Productivity\n   - Learning\n   - Personal\n3. Add a \"Frequency\" property (Select type) with options:\n   - Daily\n   - Weekly\n   - Monthly\n4. Add a \"Completion\" property (Formula type) - we'll set this up later\n5. Add a \"Days Completed\" property (Number type)\n6. Add a \"Target Days\" property (Number type)\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Formulas\nFor the \"Completion\" property, enter this formula:\n```\nround(prop(\"Days Completed\") / prop(\"Target Days\") * 100) + \"%\"\n```\n\nThis will calculate your completion percentage automatically.\n\n### Step 4: Create a Progress Bar\n1. Add a \"Progress\" property (Formula type)\n2. Enter this formula:\n```\nslice(\"\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\", 0, floor(prop(\"Days Completed\") / prop(\"Target Days\") * 10)) + slice(\"\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\", 0, 10 - floor(prop(\"Days Completed\") / prop(\"Target Days\") * 10))\n```\n3. This creates a visual progress bar using filled and empty squares\n\n### Step 5: Add Your Habits\nBegin adding habits to your tracker:\n1. Click \"+ New\" to add a habit\n2. Name it (e.g., \"Daily Reading\")\n3. Select a category\n4. Set frequency\n5. Enter target days (e.g., 30 for a monthly goal)\n6. Start with 0 for days completed\n\n## Syncing to Mobile\n\n1. Download the Notion app on your mobile device\n2. Log in with the same account credentials\n3. Navigate to your workspace\n4. Find and bookmark your Habit Tracker for easy access\n5. Enable notifications in Notion settings for daily reminders\n\n## Daily Usage Tips\n\n1. Update your tracker daily by increasing the \"Days Completed\" number\n2. Watch your progress bar fill up as you maintain consistency\n3. Review weekly to identify patterns and areas for improvement\n4. Adjust target days as needed based on your progress\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour Notion habit tracker serves as both a checkpoint system and a visual nudge to maintain progress on your goals. By documenting your habits and seeing your progress, you're applying effective self-direction techniques that support your time management skills.",
