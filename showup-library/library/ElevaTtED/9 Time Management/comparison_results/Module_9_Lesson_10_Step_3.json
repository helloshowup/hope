Your question should invite others to share their experiences or perspectives.\n\n### Guidelines for Responding to Peers:\n\nWhen responding to your classmates' posts, please:\n- Be specific and reference details from their post\n- Share relevant personal experiences that connect to their insight\n- Offer constructive suggestions when appropriate\n- Respond thoughtfully to their question\n- Limit responses to 100-150 words to maintain focus\n\n### Practicing Empathy:\n\nRemember that everyone's time management journey is unique.
