Drag and resize your widgets by clicking and holding the corners\n2. Add headings and dividers using `/heading` and `/divider` commands\n3. Create these additional sections to support your Excel High School journey:\n   - Daily priorities (top 3 academic tasks)\n   - Course progress tracker\n   - Assignment due dates\n   - Study session planner\n   - Notes section for each course\n   - Weekly academic goals\n   - Links to Excel High School resources (Student Portal, BRYTE AI Tutor, Writing Lab)\n\n### Step 6: Share Your Dashboard (Optional)\n\n1.
