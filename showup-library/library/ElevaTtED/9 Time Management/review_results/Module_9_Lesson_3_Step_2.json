This activity will guide you through decluttering both your physical desk and digital desktop, creating an environment that supports your learning goals at Excel High School.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy completing this activity, you will:\n- Create an organized physical and digital workspace that supports your learning\n- Identify strategies to maintain an effective study environment\n- Reflect on how your environment impacts your academic performance\n\n## Physical Workspace Decluttering Checklist\n\n1. **Clear Everything Off**: Remove all items from your desk surface\n2. **Sort Items**: Create three piles:\n   - Keep (items you use daily/weekly)\n   - Store (items needed occasionally)\n   - Discard (items you no longer need)\n3. **Clean Surface**: Wipe down your desk completely\n4. **Organize Essentials**: Return only necessary items to your desk\n5. **Create Zones**: Designate specific areas for:\n   - Current schoolwork\n   - Writing tools\n   - Technology\n   - Reference materials\n6. **Manage Cables**: Use clips or ties to keep cords organized\n7. **Add Inspiration**: Include one meaningful item that motivates you\n\n![Example of organized desk with labeled zones](https://example.com/organized-desk.jpg)\n*Example: Notice how this desk has clear zones for different activities*\n\n**Time Management Tip:** If you're short on time, set a timer for just 15 minutes and complete as many steps as possible. Even small improvements can make a difference!\n\n## Digital Desktop Decluttering Checklist\n\n1. **Screenshot Current State**: Take a \"before\" picture of your desktop\n2. **Create Temporary Folder**: Make a folder called \"Desktop Items\"\n3. **Move Everything**: Place all desktop files into this folder\n4. **Sort Digital Files**: Create folders for:\n   - Excel High School coursework (organized by subject)\n   - Personal projects\n   - Reference materials\n   - Downloads (to be processed)\n5. **Return Essentials Only**: Place only frequently used program shortcuts on desktop\n6. **Organize Icons**: Arrange remaining icons in a logical pattern\n7. **Set Professional Background**: Choose a simple, distraction-free wallpaper\n\n![Example of organized digital desktop](https://example.com/organized-desktop.jpg)\n*Example: Clean desktop with minimal icons and organized folders*\n\n**Accessibility Note:** If you're using screen readers or other assistive technology, focus on creating a simple folder structure with descriptive names rather than visual organization.\n\n## Reflection Prompts\n\nAfter completing your workspace makeover, respond to at least three of these questions:\n\n1. What immediate difference do you notice in how your workspace feels?\n2. Which items did you discover you don't actually need?\n3. What was the most challenging part of this decluttering process?\n4. How might your newly organized workspace improve your study habits?\n5. What organizational system will you implement to maintain this order?\n6. How does your physical environment affect your ability to focus?\n7. What is one additional change you could make to further improve your workspace?\n\n## Maintenance Plan\n\nCreate a simple 5-minute daily routine to maintain your organized workspace. Write down three specific actions you'll take each day to prevent clutter from returning.\n\n**Example Maintenance Actions:**\n- Clear desk of dishes/trash at the end of each study session\n- File completed assignments in appropriate folders immediately\n- Delete or organize downloaded files weekly\n\n## Application to Excel High School Success\n\nConsider how your organized workspace will specifically support your Excel High School coursework. How might this environment help you:\n- Complete assignments more efficiently\n- Prepare effectively for assessments\n- Maintain focus during extended online learning sessions\n- Track your progress across multiple courses\n\nRemember: Your workspace reflects and affects your mental state. A clear desk contributes to a clear mind, supporting your success as an Excel High School student.",
