  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the reflection quiz:\n\n1. Added a specific question about time management challenges related to Excel High School coursework to make the reflection more contextually relevant and actionable.\n\n2. Added a multiple-choice question about specific time management strategies from the lesson to help students connect their reflection to concrete techniques they've learned.\n\n3. Added a \"Next Steps\" section that creates accountability and provides clear direction on what happens after completing the reflection.\n\n4. Maintained the original reflection questions while adding more structure to guide students toward practical application.\n\nThese changes better align with the learner profile by:\n- Supporting \"Self-Direction Aids\" through more specific reflection prompts\n- Providing \"Flexibility WITH Structure\" by offering clear next steps\n- Addressing the needs of adult learners and credit recovery students who benefit from practical relevance\n- Creating a stronger feedback loop that connects reflection to action"
