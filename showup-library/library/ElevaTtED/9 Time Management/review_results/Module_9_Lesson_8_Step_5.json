  "edit_summary": "I've enhanced the content by adding two additional multiple-choice questions that align with the Excel High School learner profile. These new questions:\n\n1. Address the multiple support channels available to students (BRYTE AI Tutor, Success Coach Pro, Writing Lab, etc.) which is a key feature of the Excel High School platform.\n\n2. Highlight the competency-based education model with multiple-attempt assessments, which is central to Excel's educational approach.\n\nThese additions make the FAQ check more comprehensive and better aligned with the school's instructional design drivers, particularly the \"Self-Direction Aids\" and \"Mastery-Led Feedback\" components mentioned in the learner profile. The new questions also help reinforce important aspects of the Excel High School experience that students should understand."
