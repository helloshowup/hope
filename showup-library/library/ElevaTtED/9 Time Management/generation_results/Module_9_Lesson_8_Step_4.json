    "<educational_content>\n# Peer-Sourced FAQ: Creating a Collaborative Resource\n\n## Overview\nIn this activity, you will create a valuable peer-sourced FAQ document that compiles the most common questions and answers about time management from your fellow students. This resource will serve as a reference guide for your entire cohort and help everyone improve their organizational skills.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Collect and organize peer knowledge about time management\n- Create a concise, user-friendly reference document\n- Share resources that support effective time management strategies\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### Step 1: Gather Questions and Answers\n1. Create a simple survey using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms to collect:\n   - Common time management challenges students face\n   - Questions about organizing coursework effectively\n   - Successful strategies students have implemented\n   - Resources students have found helpful\n\n2. Share the survey with your cohort and set a deadline for responses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze and Select Content\n1. Review all submissions and identify patterns in the questions.\n2. Select the top ten most frequently asked questions.\n3. For each question, craft a clear, concise answer (2-3 sentences) based on peer responses.\n4. Identify 1-2 resource links for each question that provide additional information.\n\n### Step 3: Design Your FAQ Document\n1. Create a PDF document with:\n   - A clear title: \"Peer-Sourced Time Management FAQ\"\n   - A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document\n   - The top ten questions with their answers\n   - Resource links organized by topic\n   - Acknowledgment of contributors (with permission)\n   - Contact information for further questions\n\n2. Format tips:\n   - Use headings to organize content\n   - Include a table of contents\n   - Use bullet points for clarity\n   - Add visual elements like icons to highlight key points\n   - Ensure consistent formatting throughout\n\n### Step 4: Share and Implement\n1. Share the completed PDF with your instructor for review.\n2. Distribute the approved document to your entire cohort.\n3. Consider presenting the key findings in a brief class discussion.\n4. Collect feedback for potential updates to the document.\n\n## Assessment\nYour peer-sourced FAQ will be evaluated based on:\n- Comprehensiveness of questions and answers\n- Quality and relevance of resource links\n- Organization and visual design of the PDF\n- Usefulness to the cohort as reported in feedback\n\n## Extension Activity\nConsider creating a \"Time Management Success Stories\" companion document that highlights specific strategies that worked well for your peers, complete with concrete examples and implementation tips.\n</educational_content>",
