Complete your empathy map using the following sections:\n\n1. **THINKS**: What might this person be thinking?\n2. **FEELS**: What emotions might they be experiencing?\n3. **SAYS**: What do they express verbally?\n4. **DOES**: What actions do they take?\n5. **PAIN POINTS**: What frustrations or challenges do they face?\n6. **GOALS**: What are they trying to achieve?\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Create Your Empathy Map\nChoose someone you interact with regularly (family member, friend, classmate) and complete an empathy map from their perspective. Use the template sections above to guide your work.\n\n### Step 2: Post Your Completed Map\nShare your completed empathy map in the discussion forum. Include a brief explanation of who you chose and why understanding their perspective matters to you.\n\n### Step 3: Peer Evaluation\nReview your classmates' empathy maps and select one to evaluate. Provide constructive feedback using these criteria:\n\n- **Depth of Understanding**: How thoroughly did they explore each section?\n- **Perspective Taking**: Did they effectively step into the other person's shoes?\n- **Insights**: What valuable observations did they make about relationships?\n- **Areas for Growth**: What additional perspectives might they consider?\n\n### Step 4: Guided Feedback\nWhen providing feedback, use this structure:\n- One specific strength you noticed\n- One thoughtful question that might deepen their understanding\n- One suggestion for enhancing their empathy map\n\nRemember that effective feedback is specific, constructive, and respectful.\n\n## Reflection Question\nHow might using empathy mapping improve your relationships with others?\n</educational_content>",

    "<educational_content>\n# Empathy Map Discussion\n\n## Introduction\nWelcome to our Empathy Map Discussion activity! In this exercise, we'll practice understanding others' perspectives through empathy mapping and provide constructive feedback to our peers. Empathy is a crucial skill that helps us build stronger relationships and communicate more effectively.\n\n## Empathy Map Template\nAn empathy map helps us visualize what another person thinks, feels, sees, hears, says, and does. Use the following template to complete your empathy map:\n\n* **THINKS & FEELS**: What might this person be thinking? What matters to them?\n* **SEES**: What does this person observe in their environment?\n* **HEARS**: What messages is this person receiving from others?\n* **SAYS & DOES**: How does this person behave publicly? What are they saying?\n* **PAINS**: What frustrations or challenges might this person face?\n* **GAINS**: What would success look like for this person?\n\n## Assignment Instructions\n1. Choose someone in your life (a friend, family member, classmate) or a character from media.\n2. Complete the empathy map template for this person.\n3.

Remember to be respectful and supportive in your evaluation.\n</educational_content>"
