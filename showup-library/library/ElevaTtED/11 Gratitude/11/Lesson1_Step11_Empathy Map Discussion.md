# Empathy Map Discussion

# Empathy Map Discussion

## Overview
In this activity, you will create an empathy map to better understand someone else's perspective, share your map with peers, and provide thoughtful feedback on a classmate's work. This skill will help you build stronger relationships and develop emotional intelligence that's valuable in both personal and professional settings.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, you will:
- Apply empathy mapping techniques to understand others' perspectives
- Analyze relationships through structured observation
- Provide constructive peer feedback using specific criteria
- Reflect on how empathy impacts interpersonal communication

## Empathy Map Template
An empathy map helps us visualize and understand another person's experience. Complete your empathy map using the following sections:

1. **THINKS**: What might this person be thinking? What occupies their mind?
2. **FEELS**: What emotions might they be experiencing? Consider both positive and challenging feelings.
3. **SAYS**: What do they express verbally? Note specific phrases or communication patterns.
4. **DOES**: What actions do they take? What behaviors do you observe?
5. **PAIN POINTS**: What frustrations or challenges do they face?
6. **GOALS**: What are they trying to achieve? What motivates them?

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your Empathy Map (30-40 minutes)
Choose someone you interact with regularly (family member, friend, classmate) and complete an empathy map from their perspective. Use the template sections above to guide your work.

**Pro Tip:** For best results, focus on a specific situation or context rather than trying to map their entire personality.

### Step 2: Post Your Completed Map (10-15 minutes)
Share your completed empathy map in the discussion forum. Include:
- A brief explanation of who you chose (first name or relationship only for privacy)
- Why understanding their perspective matters to you
- One insight that surprised you during this process

### Step 3: Peer Evaluation (20-30 minutes)
Review your classmates' empathy maps and select one to evaluate. Provide constructive feedback using these criteria:

- **Depth of Understanding**: How thoroughly did they explore each section?
- **Perspective Taking**: Did they effectively step into the other person's shoes?
- **Insights**: What valuable observations did they make about relationships?
- **Areas for Growth**: What additional perspectives might they consider?

### Step 4: Guided Feedback Structure
When providing feedback, use this structure:
- One specific strength you noticed in their empathy map
- One thoughtful question that might deepen their understanding
- One suggestion for enhancing their empathy map

Remember that effective feedback is specific, constructive, and respectful.

## Reflection Question
How might using empathy mapping improve your relationships with others? Provide at least one specific example of how you could apply this technique in your life.

## Submission Requirements
- Complete all steps by the due date in your course calendar
- Your initial post should be 200-300 words
- Your peer feedback should be 100-150 words
- Use proper grammar and spelling in all communications
