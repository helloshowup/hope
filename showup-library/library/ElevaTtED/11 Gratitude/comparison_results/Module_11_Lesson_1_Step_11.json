Complete your empathy map using the following sections:\n\n1. **THINKS**: What might this person be thinking?\n2. **FEELS**: What emotions might they be experiencing?\n3. **SAYS**: What do they express verbally?\n4. **DOES**: What actions do they take?\n5. **PAIN POINTS**: What frustrations or challenges do they face?\n6. **GOALS**: What are they trying to achieve?\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Create Your Empathy Map\nChoose someone you interact with regularly (family member, friend, classmate) and complete an empathy map from their perspective. Use the template sections above to guide your work.\n\n### Step 2: Post Your Completed Map\nShare your completed empathy map in the discussion forum. Include a brief explanation of who you chose and why understanding their perspective matters to you.\n\n### Step 3: Peer Evaluation\nReview your classmates' empathy maps and select one to evaluate. Provide constructive feedback using these criteria:\n\n- **Depth of Understanding**: How thoroughly did they explore each section?\n- **Perspective Taking**: Did they effectively step into the other person's shoes?\n- **Insights**: What valuable observations did they make about relationships?\n- **Areas for Growth**: What additional perspectives might they consider?\n\n### Step 4: Guided Feedback\nWhen providing feedback, use this structure:\n- One specific strength you noticed\n- One thoughtful question that might deepen their understanding\n- One suggestion for enhancing their empathy map\n\nRemember that effective feedback is specific, constructive, and respectful.\n\n## Reflection Question\nHow might using empathy mapping improve your relationships with others?",
