# I Do — Building Your Citizenship Portfolio (Spiral 1)

# Building Your Citizenship Portfolio (Spiral 1)

## Introduction

Welcome to the first phase of creating your Citizenship Portfolio! This portfolio will showcase your civic learning journey and demonstrate how you've made a positive impact in your community. In this guide, we'll explore the required artifacts, optional enrichments, and impact criteria that will help you build a compelling portfolio.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
* Create a personal civic statement that reflects your values and understanding of citizenship
* Analyze a community issue using research and multiple perspectives
* Develop an actionable civic engagement plan
* Document and assess the impact of your civic activities

## Required Artifacts

Your Citizenship Portfolio must include these five essential components:

1. **Personal Civic Statement** (1-2 pages)
   * A reflection on your understanding of citizenship
   * Your civic values and beliefs
   * How you see yourself as an active citizen

2. **Community Issue Analysis** (2-3 pages)
   * Identification of a local community issue
   * Research on the causes and effects of this issue
   * Multiple perspectives on the issue from different stakeholders

3. **Civic Action Plan** (1-2 pages)
   * Detailed steps you will take to address your chosen issue
   * Timeline for implementation
   * Resources needed and potential partners

4. **Documentation of Civic Engagement** (varies)
   * Photos, videos, or written accounts of your civic activities
   * Minimum of 5 hours of documented civic engagement
   * Reflection on what you learned through the experience

5. **Impact Assessment** (1-2 pages)
   * Evaluation of your civic action's effectiveness
   * Feedback from community members or stakeholders
   * Lessons learned and recommendations for future action

## Optional Enrichments

Enhance your portfolio with these optional elements:

* **Interviews with Community Leaders**
  * Conduct and document conversations with local officials or community organizers

  * Present your findings and actions to classmates, school board, or community group

* **Collaborative Project**
  * Partner with other students or community organizations

* **Extended Research**
  * Deeper investigation into the historical context or comparative analysis of your issue

## Impact Criteria

Your portfolio will be evaluated based on these impact criteria:

| Criteria | Basic | Proficient | Advanced |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| Depth of Understanding | Identifies surface-level aspects of civic issue | Analyzes causes and effects of civic issue | Evaluates complex interconnections and systemic factors |
| Community Engagement | Minimal interaction with community | Active participation in community activities | Sustained collaboration with community stakeholders |
| Action Implementation | Planned but limited action steps | Completed meaningful civic action | Implemented action with measurable community impact |
| Reflection Quality | Basic description of activities | Thoughtful analysis of civic learning | Critical examination of personal growth and societal implications |
