# We Do — Privacy Settings Walk-through

# We Do — Privacy Settings Walk-through

## Introduction

Welcome to our hands-on privacy settings tutorial! Today, we'll practice adjusting privacy and security settings on a mock social network called "ConnectSphere." Understanding how to protect your digital privacy is an essential skill in today's interconnected world. Let's walk through this process together.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Navigate to privacy settings on a social media platform
- Enable two-factor authentication for account security
- Adjust profile visibility settings to protect personal information
- Review and manage third-party app permissions
- Verify that your privacy settings are working as intended

## Step 1: Accessing Privacy Settings

1. Log in to your ConnectSphere mock account using the credentials provided in the assignment.
2. Look for the menu icon (typically represented by three horizontal lines or dots) in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Click on the menu and select "Settings and Privacy" from the dropdown options.

**Checkpoint:** Can you find the Settings and Privacy menu? If you're having trouble, use the BRYTE AI Tutor for assistance.

## Step 2: Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a second verification step beyond your password.

1. In the Settings menu, select "Security and Account Access."
2. Click on "Security."
3. Find and select "Two-Factor Authentication."
4. Click "Enable 2FA."
5. Choose your preferred 2FA method:
   - Text message verification
   - Authentication app (like Google Authenticator)
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup.
7. Be sure to save the provided backup codes in a secure location.

**Pro Tip:** Using an authentication app is generally more secure than text message verification because it doesn't rely on your phone number, which can sometimes be compromised.

## Step 3: Restricting Profile Visibility

Controlling who can see your information is crucial for maintaining privacy.

1. Return to the main Settings menu.
2. Select "Privacy and Safety."
3. Click on "Profile Visibility."
4. Adjust the following settings:
   - Set "Who can see my profile?" to "Friends Only"
   - Set "Who can see my posts?" to "Friends Only"
   - Toggle "Allow search engines to link to your profile" to OFF
   - Set "Who can tag you in photos?" to "Friends Only"
5. Review your choices and click "Save Changes."

**Real-World Application:** These same principles apply to platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. Regularly reviewing these settings on your actual accounts helps protect your digital footprint.

## Step 4: Revoking App Access Tokens

Many apps and services connect to your social media accounts. It's important to review and revoke access for apps you no longer use.

1. Navigate back to "Security and Account Access."
2. Select "Apps and Sessions."
3. Review the list of connected applications.
4. For any app you don't recognize or no longer use:
   - Click on the app name
   - Select "Revoke Access"
   - Confirm your choice when prompted
5. Pay special attention to apps with extensive permissions.

**Quick Check:** Why is it important to revoke access for unused apps? Think about what information these apps might have access to.

## Step 5: Verification and Review

Let's confirm all our changes have been properly saved:

1. Log out of ConnectSphere completely.
2. Log back in (you should now be prompted for your 2FA verification).
3. Visit your profile page while logged out of your account in another browser to verify your content is no longer publicly visible.
4. Check that previously connected apps can no longer access your account.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully enhanced the privacy and security of your mock social media account. Remember to regularly review these settings on your actual social media accounts, as platforms frequently update their privacy options and new apps may request access to your information.

## Next Steps
- Complete the "Your Turn" activity where you'll apply these same principles to another mock platform
- Take the brief quiz to test your understanding of key privacy concepts
- Share one new thing you learned about digital privacy in the discussion forum
