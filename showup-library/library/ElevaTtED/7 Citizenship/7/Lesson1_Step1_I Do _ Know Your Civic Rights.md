## Animated Video Script

**NARRATOR:** Welcome to "Know Your Civic Rights"! Today, we're exploring what it means to be an active citizen in our democracy.

**NARRATOR:** As citizens, we have both rights AND responsibilities. Let's start with our civic rights.

**NARRATOR:** Civic rights are freedoms guaranteed to all citizens. These include:

1. **Freedom of Speech** - You can express your opinions without fear of government punishment.

2. **Right to Vote** - You can help choose your representatives in government.
   **[ANIMATION: Character placing ballot in voting box]**

3. **Right to a Fair Trial** - If accused of a crime, you're entitled to a fair and speedy trial.
   **[ANIMATION: Balanced scales of justice]**

**NARRATOR:** But with rights come responsibilities!

**[SCENE CHANGE: Historical black and white footage style animation]**

**NARRATOR:** Throughout history, people have fought to expand and protect civic rights. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s shows us how citizens used their rights to create change.

**[ANIMATION: Scenes of peaceful protests, voting rights marches]**

**NARRATOR:** Leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used free speech to advocate for equal rights. Ordinary citizens marched, spoke out, and voted to end segregation and discrimination.

**[SCENE CHANGE: Modern day setting with smartphones and computers]**

**NARRATOR:** Today, we exercise our civic rights in new ways. Let's look at an example.

**[ANIMATION: Character notices a problem in their community - a park in disrepair]**

**NARRATOR:** When Maya noticed her community park needed repairs, she started an online petition.

**[ANIMATION: Character creating petition on computer, sharing with friends]**

**NARRATOR:** She exercised her free speech rights by speaking up about a community issue. Other citizens signed her petition, and together they presented it at a city council meeting.

**[ANIMATION: Group presenting petition to city officials]**

**NARRATOR:** The council listened and approved funding for park repairs. By understanding and using her civic rights, Maya fulfilled her responsibility to improve her community.

**[FINAL SCENE: Diverse group of citizens engaged in various civic activities]**

**NARRATOR:** Now it's your turn to reflect: What civic issue matters to you, and how might you use your rights responsibly to make a difference?

**[TEXT APPEARS ON SCREEN: "What civic issue matters to you?"]**
