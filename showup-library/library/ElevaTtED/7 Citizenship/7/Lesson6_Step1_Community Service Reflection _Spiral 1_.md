### Impact Analysis (100-125 words)
Reflect on the impact your service had:
* How did your contributions directly benefit others in the community?
* What tangible outcomes resulted from the service project?
* Were there any unexpected effects of your service?
* How might the impact of your service continue beyond your direct involvement?
* What needs in the community does this service address?

* What moments during your service were most meaningful to you and why?
* How might this experience influence your future choices or actions?
* What did you learn about yourself through this service experience?

## Writing Tips
* **Be specific**: Use concrete examples from your experience rather than general statements.
* **Show depth**: Focus on quality of reflection rather than covering every prompt superficially.
* **Be authentic**: Share genuine insights, including challenges you faced or moments of uncertainty.
* **Make connections**: Link your service experience to concepts from your coursework when relevant.
