# You Do — Motivate Your Peers

# You Do — Motivate Your Peers

## Lesson Objective
Learn to create persuasive motivational content that inspires peers toward active citizenship.

## Introduction
Motivational writing is a powerful tool for inspiring action and creating positive change in your community. In this activity, you'll craft a short motivational post that encourages your peers to engage in active citizenship. Your message should be concise yet impactful, using persuasive techniques to inspire others.

## Activity Instructions

### Step 1: Understanding the Components
A strong motivational post includes:
- **Hook**: An attention-grabbing opening that draws readers in
- **Benefits**: Clear reasons why the action matters and how it benefits individuals or the community
- **Call to Action**: A specific, actionable request that tells readers exactly what to do next

### Step 2: Brainstorming
Before writing, consider:
- What citizenship activity are you promoting? (volunteering, voting, community service, etc.)
- Who is your target audience among your peers?
- What would motivate this specific audience?
- What objections might they have, and how can you address them?

### Step 3: Drafting Your Motivational Post
Compose a 150-word motivational post that includes:
1. An engaging hook (1-2 sentences)
2. Clear benefits of participation (2-3 sentences)
3. A specific call to action (1-2 sentences)

Remember to:
- Use positive, energetic language
- Appeal to emotions and values
- Keep your message concise and focused
- Make your call to action clear and achievable

### Step 4: Reflection and Self-Assessment
After completing your motivational post:
1. Review your work using the rubric below
2. Make any necessary revisions
3. Submit your final draft

## Assessment Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (3) | Satisfactory (2) | Needs Improvement (1) |
|----------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Hook | Opening immediately captures attention and creates interest | Opening somewhat captures attention | Opening is weak or missing |
| Benefits | Clearly explains multiple compelling benefits with specific details | Mentions benefits but lacks detail or persuasiveness | Benefits are unclear or unconvincing |
| Call to Action | Specific, clear direction that is easy to follow | Action requested is somewhat clear | Action requested is vague or missing |
| Persuasiveness | Language is highly motivating and compelling | Somewhat motivating language | Not particularly motivating |
| Conciseness | Stays within word count while being impactful | Slightly over/under word count but effective | Significantly over/under word count or ineffective use of words |
