# You Do — Feedback Loop Check

# You Do — Feedback Loop Check

## Understanding the Mastery Feedback Loop

In this lesson, we'll explore a significant 2018 study about mastery feedback and how it can improve your learning process. This research provides valuable insights into how feedback loops can enhance your educational experience and develop important skills that will benefit you both academically and personally.

### The 2018 Mastery Feedback Study: Key Findings

In 2018, researchers conducted a comprehensive study examining how structured feedback affects student mastery of key competencies. The study involved over 1,200 high school students across diverse educational settings and revealed several important findings:

Students who received regular, targeted feedback on their work showed a 32% improvement in mastery of key concepts compared to those who received only general comments or grades. This improvement was particularly notable in developing important competencies such as critical analysis, understanding complex processes, and constructing evidence-based arguments.

What made this study particularly valuable was its focus on the feedback loop process. Students weren't just receiving comments; they were actively engaging with feedback through a structured process:

1. Initial work submission
2. Receiving specific, actionable feedback
3. Reflecting on feedback
4. Revising work based on feedback
5. Demonstrating improved understanding

**Comprehension Check #1:** According to the 2018 study, by what percentage did students who received targeted feedback improve their mastery of key concepts compared to those who received only general comments?
- A) 12%
- B) 22% 
- C) 32%
- D) 42%

### Benefits of Mastery-Led Feedback

The study highlighted several significant benefits of implementing mastery-led feedback approaches:

**Enhanced Learning Retention:** Students who engaged with feedback and made revisions retained information 40% longer than those who simply moved on to new material after receiving a grade.

**Improved Critical Thinking:** The process of analyzing feedback and determining how to implement it developed stronger critical thinking skills, with students showing increased ability to evaluate information from multiple perspectives.

**Greater Student Agency:** Students reported feeling more ownership of their learning process when they had opportunities to revise and improve their work.

**Transferable Skills:** The skills developed through feedback engagement transferred to other subjects and real-world applications.

**Reduced Learning Anxiety:** Students experienced less anxiety about assessments when they knew they would have opportunities to learn from mistakes and demonstrate growth.

**Comprehension Check #2:** Which of the following was NOT listed as a benefit of mastery-led feedback?
- A) Enhanced learning retention
- B) Improved critical thinking
- C) Automatic grade improvement
- D) Greater student agency

### Implementing Feedback Loops in Your Learning at Excel High School

At Excel High School, you'll experience this mastery-led feedback approach in your courses. Here are several strategies to help you maximize the benefits of feedback loops:

1. **Active Engagement:** Don't just read feedback—interact with it by asking questions, seeking clarification, and planning specific revisions. Use the BRYTE AI Tutor when you need additional help understanding feedback.

2. **Reflection Time:** Schedule dedicated time to process feedback before attempting revisions. This might mean taking a short break after receiving feedback before starting your revisions.

3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for recurring feedback themes across different assignments to identify areas for focused improvement. Your Success Coach can help you identify these patterns.

4. **Peer Feedback:** Consider supplementing teacher feedback by using Excel's Writing Lab for additional perspectives on your work.

5. **Self-Assessment:** Before submitting revisions, evaluate your own work using the same criteria your teacher uses. This self-check step can significantly improve your final submission.

**Comprehension Check #3:** What was one of the recommended strategies for students to maximize the benefits of feedback loops?
- A) Waiting several weeks before reviewing feedback
- B) Focusing only on positive comments
- C) Active engagement with feedback
- D) Requesting fewer feedback opportunities

By understanding and implementing these research-based approaches to feedback, you can significantly enhance your learning experience at Excel High School and develop stronger competencies that will serve you well beyond the classroom.

**Answers to Comprehension Checks:**
1. C) 32%
2. C) Automatic grade improvement
3. C) Active engagement with feedback
