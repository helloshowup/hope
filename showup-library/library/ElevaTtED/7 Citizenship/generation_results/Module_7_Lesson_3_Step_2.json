This guided activity will walk you through adjusting privacy and security settings on a mock social network called \"ConnectSphere.\" By following these steps, you'll learn practical skills that can be applied to real social media platforms.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Configure two-factor authentication (2FA)\n- Adjust profile visibility settings\n- Revoke access tokens from third-party applications\n\n## Step 1: Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a second verification method beyond your password.\n\n1. Log in to your ConnectSphere account\n2. Navigate to \"Settings\" by clicking the gear icon in the top-right corner\n3. Select \"Security and Login\" from the left menu\n4. Find \"Two-Factor Authentication\" and click \"Edit\"\n5. Choose your preferred 2FA method:\n   - Text message verification\n   - Authentication app (recommended)\n6. If selecting the authentication app option:\n   - Download an authenticator app if you don't already have one (like Google Authenticator)\n   - Scan the QR code displayed on screen with your app\n   - Enter the 6-digit code generated by your app\n7. Save your backup codes in a secure location\n8. Click \"Enable 2FA\" to complete the process\n\n## Step 2: Restricting Profile Visibility\n\nControlling who can see your information helps protect your privacy.\n\n1. Return to \"Settings\"\n2. Select \"Privacy\" from the left menu\n3. Under \"Who can see my profile information,\" adjust the following:\n   - Set \"Who can see my future posts\" to \"Friends only\"\n   - Change \"Who can see my friend list\" to \"Only me\"\n   - Adjust \"Who can look me up using my email/phone\" to \"Friends\"\n4. Scroll down to \"Profile details privacy\" section\n   - Set your birthday visibility to \"Only show month and day\"\n   - Change work history to \"Friends\"\n   - Set education history to \"Friends\"\n5. Click \"Save Changes\" at the bottom of the page\n\n## Step 3: Revoking App Tokens\n\nThird-party applications that connect to your social media can access your data. Regularly reviewing and revoking unnecessary access is important.\n\n1. Go back to \"Settings\"\n2. Select \"Apps and Websites\" from the left menu\n3. Review the list of connected applications\n4. For each app you no longer use or don't recognize:\n   - Click on the app name\n   - Review what permissions it has\n   - Click \"Remove\" button\n   - Confirm removal when prompted\n5. For apps you want to keep but limit:\n   - Click on the app name\n   - Uncheck unnecessary permissions\n   - Click \"Save Changes\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've successfully enhanced the security of your mock ConnectSphere account by enabling 2FA, restricting profile visibility, and managing third-party app access. These same principles apply to real social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others. Remember to regularly review your privacy settings on all platforms as companies often update their privacy options.\n</educational_content>",
