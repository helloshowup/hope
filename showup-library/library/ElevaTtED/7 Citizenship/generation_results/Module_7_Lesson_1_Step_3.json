    "<educational_content>\n# You Do \u2014 Forum Debate: Duty vs Right\n\n## Assignment Overview\n\nIn this forum debate, you will explore the complex relationship between civic duty and individual rights in a democratic society. This activity challenges you to think critically about when, if ever, civic responsibilities should take precedence over personal freedoms.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Evaluate competing civic values in democratic societies\n- Construct evidence-based arguments on civic issues\n- Analyze and respond thoughtfully to peers' perspectives\n- Practice civil discourse on controversial topics\n\n## Assignment Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Initial Post (250 words)\nWrite a 250-word argument addressing the following question:\n**Should civic duty override individual rights in a democratic society?**\n\nYour initial post must:\n- Take a clear position (either supporting or opposing the prioritization of civic duty)\n- Include at least one real-life example that supports your position\n- Cite at least one credible source to strengthen your argument\n- Consider potential counterarguments to your position\n- Follow standard writing conventions (grammar, spelling, punctuation)\n\n### Part 2: Peer Responses (100 words each)\nAfter submitting your initial post, read your classmates' arguments and respond to at least two peers who have taken positions different from yours. Each response should be approximately 100 words and must:\n- Acknowledge the strengths of your peer's argument\n- Respectfully challenge at least one aspect of their reasoning\n- Ask a thoughtful question that encourages further discussion\n- Maintain a civil, academic tone\n\n## Grading Criteria\nYour participation will be evaluated based on:\n- Quality and clarity of your initial argument (15 points)\n- Effective use of real-life examples and sources (10 points)\n- Thoughtfulness of peer responses (10 points)\n- Adherence to length requirements and writing conventions (5 points)\n- Overall contribution to a respectful exchange of ideas (10 points)\n\n## Tips for Success\n- Research both sides of the issue before forming your argument\n- Consider historical and contemporary examples where this tension has emerged\n- Remember that complex issues rarely have simple answers\n- Focus on the merits of arguments rather than attacking individuals\n- Use specific examples rather than broad generalizations\n- Cite reputable sources (government documents, academic journals, established news outlets)\n\n## Example Topics to Consider\n- Mandatory voting laws\n- Jury duty participation\n- Military service and draft requirements\n- Taxation for public services\n- Public health measures during emergencies\n- Environmental regulations and individual property rights\n\nRemember that the goal of this exercise is not to \"win\" an argument but to deepen your understanding of the complex relationship between individual freedoms and collective responsibilities in a democratic society.\n\n**Due Date:** Your initial post is due by [specific date], and your two peer responses are due by [specific date].\n</educational_content>",

This forum debate will help you develop critical thinking skills while evaluating the sometimes competing interests of personal freedom and societal responsibility.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Analyze the relationship between civic duties and individual rights\n- Construct a well-reasoned argument supported by evidence\n- Evaluate peer perspectives and provide thoughtful responses\n- Practice respectful academic discourse\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Your Initial Post\nWrite a 250-word argument addressing the following question:\n**Should civic duty override individual rights in a democratic society?**\n\nYour post should:\n- Take a clear position (either supporting that civic duties should override individual rights OR that individual rights should take precedence)\n- Include at least one real-life example that supports your position\n- Cite at least one credible source to strengthen your argument\n- Consider potential counterarguments\n- Follow standard writing conventions (proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation)\n\n### Part 2: Peer Responses\nAfter submitting your initial post, read through your classmates' arguments and respond to at least two peers who took positions different from yours. Each response should be approximately 100 words and:\n- Acknowledge the strengths of your peer's argument\n- Respectfully challenge a specific point with a counterargument\n- Ask a thought-provoking question that extends the discussion\n- Maintain a respectful, academic tone\n\n## Sample Approach\n\n**If arguing that civic duty should sometimes override individual rights:**\nYou might discuss mandatory vaccination programs during public health emergencies, military draft during wartime, or tax obligations that fund essential public services.\n\n**If arguing that individual rights should generally take precedence:**\nYou might discuss freedom of speech cases, religious exemptions, or historical examples where government overreach led to rights violations.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nYour participation will be evaluated based on:\n- The clarity and persuasiveness of your argument\n- Effective use of evidence and examples\n- Quality of engagement with peers' ideas\n- Demonstration of critical thinking\n- Adherence to the assignment guidelines\n\n## Submission Timeline\n- Initial post due: [INSTRUCTOR TO INSERT DATE]\n- Peer responses due: [INSTRUCTOR TO INSERT DATE]\n\nRemember that the goal of this forum is not simply to \"win\" an argument but to thoughtfully explore the complex relationship between our obligations to society and our personal freedoms.\n</educational_content>",
