    "<educational_content>\n# You Do \u2014 Editorial Analysis Quiz\n\n## Interactive Fallacy and Evidence Quality Assessment\n\nTest your critical thinking skills with this 10-question quiz. For each example, identify the logical fallacy present and rate the quality of evidence.\n\n### Question 1\n**Statement:** \"Senator Johnson must be corrupt because all politicians are corrupt.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Hasty generalization\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This is a hasty generalization that assumes all members of a group share the same characteristic without sufficient evidence.\n\n### Question 2\n**Statement:** \"If we allow same-day voter registration, next thing you know, people will be voting multiple times and elections will be meaningless.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Slippery slope\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Excellent! This is a slippery slope fallacy that assumes one action will inevitably lead to extreme consequences without evidence.\n\n### Question 3\n**Statement:** \"According to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Political Science, districts with mail-in voting showed no statistically significant increase in fraud cases over a 20-year period.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** No fallacy present\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Strong\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This statement cites specific research from a credible source with a substantial time frame.\n\n### Question 4\n**Statement:** \"My opponent wants to increase education funding, but can we trust someone who got a C in economics during college?\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Ad hominem\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Right! This attacks the person rather than addressing their argument.\n\n### Question 5\n**Statement:** \"The mayor claims the new highway will reduce traffic, but she's just saying that because construction companies donated to her campaign.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Genetic fallacy\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This dismisses an argument based on its origin rather than its merits.\n\n### Question 6\n**Statement:** \"Either we cut taxes dramatically or the economy will collapse.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** False dilemma\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Excellent! This presents only two extreme options when many alternatives exist.\n\n### Question 7\n**Statement:** \"A recent survey of 50 people at the mall showed that 80% oppose the new zoning law.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** No clear fallacy, but sampling bias\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Weak\n> **Feedback:** Correct! While not technically a fallacy, this uses a small, non-representative sample to draw broad conclusions.\n\n### Question 8\n**Statement:** \"The city council's proposal must be good because it was approved unanimously.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Appeal to popularity\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Right! This assumes something is correct simply because many people support it.\n\n### Question 9\n**Statement:** \"Climate legislation is unnecessary because it was cold last winter.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Anecdotal evidence\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Very poor\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This uses a single personal observation to contradict systematic scientific evidence.\n\n### Question 10\n**Statement:** \"According to three independent economic analyses, the infrastructure bill would create approximately 2 million jobs over five years, though estimates vary by \u00b115%.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** No fallacy present\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Strong\n> **Feedback:** Excellent! This presents specific data from multiple sources while acknowledging limitations.\n</educational_content>",

For each example, identify the logical fallacy present and rate the quality of evidence on a scale of 1-5 (1=poor, 5=excellent).\n\n### Question 1\n\"Senator Lee must be corrupt because three of his campaign donors were investigated for tax fraud.\"\n* Fallacy: Guilt by Association\n* Evidence Quality: 2\n* Feedback: This assumes wrongdoing based on connections without direct evidence linking the senator to any improper actions.\n\n### Question 2\n\"If we allow citizens to protest this policy, next thing you know, there will be complete anarchy in the streets.\"\n* Fallacy: Slippery Slope\n* Evidence Quality: 1\n* Feedback: This makes an extreme prediction without evidence that one action will inevitably lead to the extreme outcome.\n\n### Question 3\n\"Over 500 economists from diverse political backgrounds signed a statement supporting this tax reform.\"\n* Fallacy: None present\n* Evidence Quality: 4\n* Feedback: This cites a specific number of relevant experts with diverse perspectives, though more details about their reasoning would strengthen it further.\n\n### Question 4\n\"My opponent wants to increase education funding, but can we trust someone who got a C in high school economics?\"\n* Fallacy: Ad Hominem\n* Evidence Quality: 1\n* Feedback: This attacks the person's past academic performance rather than addressing the actual policy proposal.\n\n### Question 5\n\"The mayor claims crime is down, but I know someone who was robbed last month.\"\n* Fallacy: Anecdotal Evidence\n* Evidence Quality: 1\n* Feedback: This substitutes a single personal experience for statistical data that would show actual crime trends.\n\n### Question 6\n\"According to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Public Policy, cities that implemented this program saw a 15% reduction in homelessness over three years.\"\n* Fallacy: None present\n* Evidence Quality: 5\n* Feedback: This cites specific research with measurable results from a credible source.\n\n### Question 7\n\"Either we cut environmental regulations or watch our economy collapse.\"\n* Fallacy: False Dilemma\n* Evidence Quality: 1\n* Feedback: This presents only two extreme options when many alternative approaches exist.\n\n### Question 8\n\"The new healthcare bill must be good because it's 2,000 pages long.\"\n* Fallacy: Appeal to Size/Complexity\n* Evidence Quality: 1\n* Feedback: The length of legislation doesn't indicate its quality or effectiveness.\n\n### Question 9\n\"Most Americans support this policy according to a survey of 1,500 registered voters across all 50 states, with a margin of error of \u00b13%.\"\n* Fallacy: None present\n* Evidence Quality: 4\n* Feedback: This provides specific sample information and acknowledges limitations through the margin of error.\n\n### Question 10\n\"We've always elected mayors from established political families, so we should continue this tradition.\"\n* Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition\n* Evidence Quality: 2\n* Feedback: This assumes past practices should continue without evaluating their merit or effectiveness.\n</educational_content>",
