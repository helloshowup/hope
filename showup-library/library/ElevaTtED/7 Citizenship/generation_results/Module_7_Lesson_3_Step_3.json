If you disagree with me, you're part of the problem!\"\n\n## Scenario 2: Misinformation\n**Forum Post:** \"I read online that you don't need to cite sources in academic writing anymore. My cousin's friend is in college and says nobody checks citations anyway. So I'm not going to bother with references for this project since it's all just busy work.\"\n\n## Scenario 3: Trolling\n**Forum Post:** \"lol why is everyone trying so hard in this class? none of this matters in real life. just copy answers from google like i do. teachers don't even read our work anyway \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\"\n\n## Submission Requirements\nFor each scenario, submit:\n1.

So I'm not bothering with citations for my research paper. It saves time and nobody really checks anyway.\"\n\n### Scenario 3: Trolling\n**Original Post:** \"LOL this class is so boring!!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Why do we even need to learn this stuff?
