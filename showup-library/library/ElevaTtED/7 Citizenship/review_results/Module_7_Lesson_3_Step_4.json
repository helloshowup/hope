  "reviewed_content": "# Personal Digital Citizenship Pledge\n\n## Introduction\nIn today's digital world, how we behave online reflects who we are as individuals. Creating a personal digital citizenship pledge helps you commit to positive online behavior while developing healthy digital habits. Today, you'll create your own customized digital citizenship pledge using Canva that outlines your commitment to being a responsible digital citizen.\n\n## Learning Objective\nBy the end of this activity, you will create a personal digital citizenship pledge that demonstrates your commitment to respectful and responsible online behavior.\n\n## Time Required\n* Approximately 30-45 minutes to complete all steps\n\n## Materials Needed\n* Computer or mobile device with internet access\n* Canva account (free)\n\n## Creating Your Digital Citizenship Pledge\n\n### Step 1: Access Canva\n1. Go to [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) and sign in to your account (or create a free account if needed)\n2. Search for \"certificate\" or \"pledge\" templates in the search bar\n3. Select a template that appeals to you and can be customized for your pledge\n\n**Pro Tip:** If you're new to Canva, take a few minutes to explore the basic tools. You can hover over icons to see what they do!\n\n### Step 2: Craft Your Pledge Statement\nYour pledge statement should be a clear, meaningful promise about how you'll conduct yourself online. \n\n**Your pledge should reflect YOUR personal values and commitments.**\n\nHere are some examples to inspire you:\n* \"I pledge to be a responsible digital citizen who treats others with respect, protects personal information, and contributes positively to online communities.\"\n* \"As a digital citizen, I commit to using technology ethically and responsibly, being mindful of my digital footprint, and standing against cyberbullying.\"\n\n### Step 3: Develop Three Actionable Habits\nIdentify three specific, actionable habits that support your pledge. These should be concrete behaviors you can practice daily. \n\n**Choose habits that are meaningful to YOU and that you can realistically maintain.**\n\nExamples might include:\n\n1. \"I will think before I post, ensuring my content is respectful and kind.\"\n2. \"I will protect my personal information and respect others' privacy online.\"\n3. \"I will give proper credit when sharing others' work and ideas.\"\n4. \"I will report harmful content and support those experiencing cyberbullying.\"\n5. \"I will maintain a healthy balance between online and offline activities.\"\n\n### Step 4: Add Your Personal Signature\nInclude a space at the bottom of your pledge for your signature. This symbolizes your personal commitment to the pledge you've created.\n\n### Step 5: Design and Export\n1. Customize colors, fonts, and design elements to make your pledge visually appealing\n2. Proofread your content carefully\n3. Export your pledge as an image file (PNG or JPG)\n\n**Accessibility Tip:** Choose font colors that contrast well with your background for easy reading.\n\n### Step 6: Submit Your Pledge\nSubmit your digital citizenship pledge image through the assignment submission area in your Excel High School course portal. \n\n## Reflection Questions\nTake a few minutes to consider these questions. Your responses may be part of a follow-up discussion:\n\n1. How might following your pledge positively impact your digital experiences and relationships?\n2. What challenges might you face in upholding your pledge, and how will you overcome them?\n3. Which of your three habits do you think will be most important for your digital life, and why?\n\n## Why This Matters\nYour digital citizenship pledge isn't just a one-time assignment\u2014it's a commitment to ongoing responsible behavior in all your online interactions. The habits you're developing now will serve you throughout your academic career and beyond.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you encounter technical difficulties with Canva or have questions about this assignment, reach out to your Success Coach through the Excel High School Student Portal.",
