This activity encourages you to evaluate your understanding of personal civic responsibilities and societal contributions through asynchronous debate, fostering critical thinking skills.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Initial Post (250 words)\nWrite a well-reasoned argument addressing the following question:\n**Should civic duty override individual rights in a democratic society?**\n\nYour initial post should:\n- Take a clear position (either supporting or opposing)\n- Include at least one real-life example that supports your position\n- Cite at least one credible source to strengthen your argument\n- Be approximately 250 words in length\n- Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation\n\n### Part 2: Response Posts (100 words each)\nAfter posting your initial argument, read through your classmates' posts and respond to at least two peers who have taken positions different from yours. Each response should:\n- Acknowledge their perspective respectfully\n- Offer a counterpoint or extension to their argument\n- Be approximately 100 words in length\n- Continue to use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nYour contributions will be evaluated based on:\n1. Quality of reasoning and evidence presented\n2. Clarity and coherence of your position\n3. Respectful engagement with opposing viewpoints\n4. Proper citation of sources\n5. Adherence to length requirements and writing mechanics\n\n## Example Approaches\n\nWhen considering your position, you might explore questions such as:\n- When, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to limit individual freedoms for the common good?\n- What historical precedents exist for prioritizing civic duty over individual rights?\n- How do different philosophical traditions view the relationship between the individual and society?\n- What contemporary issues highlight this tension (e.g., public health measures, taxation, military service)?\n\n## Sample Sources to Consider\n- U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights\n- Philosophical works by John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, or John Stuart Mill\n- Supreme Court decisions on civil liberties\n- Current news articles on relevant social issues\n- Academic journals in political science, law, or ethics\n\nRemember that the goal of this forum is not necessarily to \"win\" an argument but to deepen our collective understanding of complex civic issues through reasoned debate. Your willingness to engage thoughtfully with different perspectives demonstrates intellectual maturity and civic mindedness.\n\n**Deadline:** Please post your initial argument by [DATE] and your responses by [DATE].\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you need assistance with this assignment, please contact your instructor or visit the writing center for support with developing your argument or citing sources properly.",
