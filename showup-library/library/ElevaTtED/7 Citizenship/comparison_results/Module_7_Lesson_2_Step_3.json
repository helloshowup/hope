For each example, identify the logical fallacy present and rate the quality of evidence.\n\n### Question 1\n**Statement:** \"Senator Johnson must be corrupt because all politicians are corrupt.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Hasty generalization\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This is a hasty generalization that assumes all members of a group share the same characteristic without sufficient evidence.\n\n### Question 2\n**Statement:** \"If we allow same-day voter registration, next thing you know, people will be voting multiple times and elections will be meaningless.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Slippery slope\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Excellent! This is a slippery slope fallacy that assumes one action will inevitably lead to extreme consequences without evidence.\n\n### Question 3\n**Statement:** \"According to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Political Science, districts with mail-in voting showed no statistically significant increase in fraud cases over a 20-year period.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** No fallacy present\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Strong\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This statement cites specific research from a credible source with a substantial time frame.\n\n### Question 4\n**Statement:** \"My opponent wants to increase education funding, but can we trust someone who got a C in economics during college?\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Ad hominem\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Right! This attacks the person rather than addressing their argument.\n\n### Question 5\n**Statement:** \"The mayor claims the new highway will reduce traffic, but she's just saying that because construction companies donated to her campaign.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Genetic fallacy\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This dismisses an argument based on its origin rather than its merits.\n\n### Question 6\n**Statement:** \"Either we cut taxes dramatically or the economy will collapse.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** False dilemma\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Excellent! This presents only two extreme options when many alternatives exist.\n\n### Question 7\n**Statement:** \"A recent survey of 50 people at the mall showed that 80% oppose the new zoning law.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** No clear fallacy, but sampling bias\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Weak\n> **Feedback:** Correct! While not technically a fallacy, this uses a small, non-representative sample to draw broad conclusions.\n\n### Question 8\n**Statement:** \"The city council's proposal must be good because it was approved unanimously.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Appeal to popularity\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor\n> **Feedback:** Right! This assumes something is correct simply because many people support it.\n\n### Question 9\n**Statement:** \"Climate legislation is unnecessary because it was cold last winter.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** Anecdotal evidence\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Very poor\n> **Feedback:** Correct! This uses a single personal observation to contradict systematic scientific evidence.\n\n### Question 10\n**Statement:** \"According to three independent economic analyses, the infrastructure bill would create approximately 2 million jobs over five years, though estimates vary by \u00b115%.\"\n- **Identify the fallacy:** No fallacy present\n- **Rate evidence quality:** Strong\n> **Feedback:** Excellent! This presents specific data from multiple sources while acknowledging limitations.",
