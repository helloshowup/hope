Today, we're focusing on servant leadership\u2014a powerful approach where leaders prioritize the needs of others above their own.\n\nServant leadership isn't about being in charge; it's about empowering others and creating positive change. As Robert K. Greenleaf, who developed this concept, said: \"The servant-leader is servant first... It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve.\"\n\n## Servant Leadership Traits (0:30-1:15)\n\n**[Visual: Graphics highlighting each trait as it's mentioned]**\n\nWhat makes a servant leader? Let's explore key traits:\n\n1. **Listening** - Servant leaders listen deeply to understand others' perspectives and needs\n2. **Empathy** - They put themselves in others' shoes to better support them\n3. **Awareness** - They stay conscious of how their actions impact the community\n4. **Commitment to growth** - They help everyone around them develop and thrive\n5. **Building community** - They bring people together around shared goals\n\nConsider Malala Yousafzai, who demonstrates these traits by amplifying the voices of girls seeking education worldwide. She listens to their struggles, empathizes with their challenges, and builds a global community of advocates.\n\n## Youth-Led Examples (1:15-2:15)\n\n**[Visual: Images of youth leaders and their initiatives]**\n\nYoung people across the world are embodying servant leadership:\n\n**Greta Thunberg** started as a single student protesting climate inaction. Rather than positioning herself as the center of attention, she uses her platform to amplify scientific voices and encourage youth worldwide to take action in their communities.\n\n**Jack Andraka** developed a breakthrough pancreatic cancer test as a teenager. Instead of keeping his research private, he openly shares his methods and encourages other young scientists to solve problems.\n\n**Local example:** Students at Carson High School noticed food insecurity in their community and created a student-run food pantry. Instead of managing everything themselves, they built a system where different student groups take responsibility, creating sustainability beyond any single leader.\n\n## Civic Impact Connections (2:15-3:00)\n\n**[Visual: Community transformation scenes showing before/after impacts]**\n\nWhen you apply servant leadership to civic action, remarkable things happen:\n\n1. **Sustainability**: Projects last beyond any single leader\n2. **Deeper impact**: By listening to community needs, solutions address real problems\n3. **Ripple effects**: As you empower others, they develop leadership skills too\n4. **Trust building**: Communities develop greater trust in youth-led initiatives\n\nRemember: The most effective civic leaders don't just solve problems\u2014they build capacity in others to create ongoing positive change.\n\nAs you consider your own leadership journey, ask yourself: \"How can I serve my community while helping others develop their own leadership potential?\"\n\n**[Closing visual: Call to action screen with reflection questions]**\n\nWhat community need could you address through servant leadership? Who might you empower along the way?",
