You'll create either a three-slide presentation or an infographic containing three key elements:\n\n1. A powerful motivational quote\n2. A social media call-to-action \n3. A reward incentive\n\n### Creating Your Motivation Toolkit\n\n#### Option 1: Three-Slide Presentation Template\n\n**Slide 1: Motivational Quote**\n- Choose or create an inspiring quote about community involvement\n- Use a compelling background image that reinforces the message\n- Include a brief explanation of why this quote matters for active citizenship\n- Example: *\"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" - Margaret Mead*\n\n**Slide 2: Social Media Call-to-Action**\n- Design a clear, specific action for peers to take\n- Include relevant hashtags to expand reach\n- Add a striking visual element that captures attention\n- Example: *\"Post a photo of your community service with #YouthCitizenshipChallenge and tag 3 friends to join the movement!\"*\n\n**Slide 3: Reward Incentive**\n- Outline the benefits of participation (both personal and community benefits)\n- Consider both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards\n- Use positive, encouraging language\n- Example: *\"Participants who complete the challenge will be featured on our school's Community Leaders Wall and receive a certificate of recognition. More importantly, you'll experience the fulfillment of making a real difference!\"*\n\n#### Option 2: Infographic Design\n\nCreate a single infographic that incorporates all three elements in a visually appealing format. Use color, icons, and an organized layout to guide viewers through your motivation toolkit.\n\n## Sharing With Peers\n\nAfter creating your motivation toolkit:\n1. Present your slide deck or infographic to a small group of peers\n2. Post it (with permission) on appropriate school platforms\n3. Collect feedback on which elements were most motivating\n4. Reflect on how your toolkit influenced peer engagement\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Creative and original motivational content\n- Clear, specific call-to-action that's easy to follow\n- Appealing visual design that captures attention\n- Appropriate incentives that match the target audience\n- Evidence of sharing with peers and collecting feedback\n\nRemember, the most effective motivation comes from authentic enthusiasm about the cause. Choose themes and approaches that genuinely inspire you!",
