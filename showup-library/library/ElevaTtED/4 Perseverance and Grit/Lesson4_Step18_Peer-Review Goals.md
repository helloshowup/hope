# Peer-Review Goals

## Discussion Board Assignment

### Instructions
In this activity, you will create a SMART academic goal and receive feedback from your peers. This process will help you refine your goals and build a supportive learning community.

**Part 1: Post Your Goal (Due: [specific date])**
Create a specific academic goal using the SMART criteria:
- **S**pecific: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
- **M**easurable: Include concrete criteria to measure progress
- **A**chievable: Make sure it's realistic given your resources and constraints
- **R**elevant: Ensure it aligns with your educational priorities
- **T**ime-bound: Set a deadline for completion

Post your goal to the discussion board, explaining:
- What your goal is
- Why it matters to you
- How you plan to achieve it (specific action steps)
- When you expect to accomplish it
- How you'll track your progress

**Example:** "I will improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of this quarter by completing 30 minutes of practice problems every day, attending weekly tutoring sessions, and reviewing my notes before each test."

**Part 2: Peer Feedback (Due: [specific date])**
Respond to at least two of your classmates' goals, offering constructive feedback using the rubric below.

### Feedback Rubric
When reviewing your peers' goals, evaluate them based on these three criteria:

1. **SMART Elements** - Does the goal include all SMART components? Is it specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound?
   - *Suggestion:* "Your goal to 'study more' could be more specific. Consider changing it to 'study biology for 45 minutes each day.'"

2. **Action Steps** - Are the steps to achieve the goal clear and realistic? Are there potential obstacles that haven't been addressed?
   - *Suggestion:* "You might want to add a plan for what to do if work commitments make it difficult to study on certain days."

3. **Accountability** - Has your peer included ways to track progress and stay accountable?
   - *Suggestion:* "Consider using a study tracking app or creating a simple chart to monitor your daily progress."

### Netiquette Reminder
Remember to maintain respectful communication when providing feedback:
- Focus on the goal, not the person
- Begin with positive observations before suggesting improvements
- Offer specific, actionable suggestions rather than vague criticism
- Use a supportive tone that encourages growth
- Ask thoughtful questions that prompt deeper reflection
