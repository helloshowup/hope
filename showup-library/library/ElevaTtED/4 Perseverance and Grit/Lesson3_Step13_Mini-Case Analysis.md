## Scenario
Jaime was excited about joining the school basketball team but didn't make the final cut after tryouts. The coach mentioned Jaime needed to improve ball-handling skills and defensive footwork. Jaime feels embarrassed and is considering giving up basketball altogether.

## Reflection Question
What would be the most effective mindset shift for Jaime?

A) "I'm just not athletic enough for basketball. I should find something else I'm naturally good at."
B) "The coach was unfair. I played better than some people who made the team."
C) "This feedback shows exactly what I need to practice. I can work on these skills and try again next season."
D) "I'll just focus on a different sport where I don't need those specific skills."

## Analysis
The optimal answer is C. This response demonstrates a growth mindset by viewing the setback as information rather than failure. Jaime recognizes that skills can be developed through dedicated practice, embraces the coach's feedback as a roadmap for improvement, and maintains persistence toward the goal.
