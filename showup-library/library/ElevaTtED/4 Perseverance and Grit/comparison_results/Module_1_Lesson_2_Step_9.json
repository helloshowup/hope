Have volunteers share their experiences and what motivated them to continue.\n\nIntroduce the concepts of perseverance and grit:\n- **Perseverance**: Steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success\n- **Grit**: Passion and perseverance for long-term goals (Angela Duckworth's definition)\n\nShare Angela Duckworth's TED Talk clip on grit (first 3 minutes) and discuss how grit predicts success better than IQ or talent alone.\n\n## Blog Post Structure (20 minutes)\nExplain the components of an effective motivational blog post:\n\n1. **Engaging Hook**: Start with a compelling question, surprising statistic, or relatable story\n2. **Main Content**: Include research-backed information about perseverance and grit\n3. **Personal Connection**: Relate the topic to readers' lives and experiences\n4. **Call-to-Action**: End with a specific, actionable suggestion for readers\n\n## Research Component (15 minutes)\nGuide students to research one study on perseverance/grit. Provide these starter resources:\n- Angela Duckworth's research on grit\n- Carol Dweck's studies on growth mindset\n- Studies on resilience in athletics and academics\n\nStudents should find at least one specific study to cite in their blog post.\n\n## Writing Workshop (30 minutes)\nStudents will draft their 250-word blog posts following these guidelines:\n\n1. Create an engaging hook that captures attention\n2. Explain why perseverance and grit matter using clear examples\n3. Cite at least one research study to support claims\n4. Connect the concepts to readers' everyday lives\n5. End with a specific call-to-action\n\n## Editorial Checklist (10 minutes)\nProvide students with this checklist to review their work:\n\n- [ ] Is my blog post approximately 250 words?\n- [ ] Does my hook grab attention in the first sentence?\n- [ ] Have I cited at least one research study correctly?\n- [ ] Is my tone positive and motivational?\n- [ ] Does my call-to-action give readers a specific next step?\n- [ ] Have I used clear, concise language without jargon?\n- [ ] Is my blog post free of grammatical and spelling errors?\n\n## Peer Review (15 minutes)\nPair students to exchange blog posts and provide feedback using the editorial checklist.\n\n## Sample Blog Post\nShare this example of a completed blog post:\n\n---\n\n**The Power of Not Giving Up**\n\nHave you ever felt like throwing in the towel when faced with a challenge? You're not alone. The difference between those who succeed and those who don't often comes down to one quality: grit.\n\nPsychologist Angela Duckworth's groundbreaking research found that grit\u2014the combination of passion and perseverance\u2014is a stronger predictor of success than IQ or talent. In her study of West Point cadets, National Spelling Bee contestants, and sales professionals, Duckworth discovered that grittier individuals were significantly more likely to achieve their goals.\n\nThis matters for your academic journey. When you encounter a difficult math problem or struggle with a complex essay, your ability to persist through frustration determines your outcome. Grit isn't about never failing; it's about getting back up every time you do.\n\nThe good news? Grit can be developed. Start by identifying a meaningful goal and breaking it into smaller milestones. Celebrate progress, but focus on the process rather than just results. When obstacles arise\u2014and they will\u2014view them as opportunities to grow stronger.\n\nToday, choose one challenge you've been avoiding and commit to working on it for just 15 minutes. Small, consistent efforts build the perseverance muscle that will carry you through life's biggest challenges.\n\nWhat will you not give up on today?\n\n---\n\n## Assessment\nStudents will submit their final 250-word blog posts for evaluation based on:\n- Adherence to the 250-word guideline\n- Inclusion of an engaging hook\n- Proper citation of at least one study\n- Effective call-to-action\n- Overall persuasiveness and motivational tone\n\n## Extension Activity\nFor students who finish early, suggest creating a visual companion piece (infographic or social media post) that highlights the key message from their blog post.",
