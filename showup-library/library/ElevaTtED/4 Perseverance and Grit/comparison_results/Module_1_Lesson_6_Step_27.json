This skill will help you recognize perseverance strategies in real-world situations.\n\n## What is Annotation?\nAnnotation is a reading strategy where we mark important parts of a text to help us understand it better. When we highlight examples of perseverance, we're training ourselves to recognize what persistence looks like in action.\n\n## Instructor Demonstration: Annotating for Perseverance\n\n### Sample Story: \"The Marathon Runner\"\n\n> Maria had trained for six months for the city marathon. On race day, the weather turned stormy with heavy rain. At mile 15, she developed a painful blister on her foot. Though she considered quitting, Maria remembered her training goal to finish no matter what. She slowed her pace but kept moving forward. When she finally crossed the finish line three hours later, her shoes were soaked, but her smile was bright.\n\n**Watch as I highlight examples of perseverance:**\n- \"trained for six months\" (showing long-term commitment)\n- \"developed a painful blister\" (facing an obstacle)\n- \"considered quitting\" (acknowledging the challenge)\n- \"remembered her training goal\" (using motivation technique)\n- \"slowed her pace but kept moving forward\" (adapting strategy)\n- \"finally crossed the finish line\" (achieving goal despite difficulties)\n\nNotice how I identified both the challenges Maria faced AND the strategies she used to overcome them.\n\n## Your Turn: Practice Annotation\n\n### Story: \"The Science Project\"\n\n> Alex had only two weeks to complete his science project. After his first experiment failed completely, he felt discouraged. His classmates seemed so far ahead. That night, he made a schedule breaking the project into small daily tasks. When his second attempt also didn't work, he asked his teacher for feedback instead of giving up. Working through lunch periods and after school, Alex completed his project just in time. Though it wasn't perfect, he was proud that he had pushed through the difficulties.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Read the story carefully first\n2. Use the online highlighter tool to mark:\n   - Challenges or obstacles faced (highlight in yellow)\n   - Perseverance strategies used (highlight in green)\n   - Results of perseverance (highlight in blue)\n3. After highlighting, reflect: Which strategy from the story could you apply to a challenge in your own life?\n\n## Why This Matters\nLearning to identify perseverance strategies in stories helps us build our own \"perseverance toolkit\" that we can use when facing challenges. The more strategies we recognize, the more options we have when we need to persist through difficult situations in school, sports, or personal goals.\n\n## Next Steps\nAfter completing this annotation exercise, we'll discuss the different strategies we identified and create our class \"Perseverance Strategy Guide\" that everyone can reference when facing challenges.",
