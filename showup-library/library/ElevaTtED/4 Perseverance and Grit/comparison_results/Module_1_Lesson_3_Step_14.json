This video will allow you to apply what you've learned about how adopting a growth mindset fosters perseverance in different learning situations.\n\n## Your PSA Checklist\n\n### Content Requirements\nYour 60-second PSA must include:\n\n1. **Hook Statement** - Start with an attention-grabbing statement that makes viewers want to listen. This could be a surprising fact, a thought-provoking question, or a bold statement about mindset.\n\n2. **Brief Personal Story** - Share a short example from your own life where you demonstrated (or needed) a growth mindset. This makes your message authentic and relatable.\n\n3. **One Actionable Tip** - Provide one specific, practical strategy that viewers can use to develop their growth mindset. Make sure it's something they can start doing right away.\n\n### Technical Guidelines\n\n**Recording Instructions:**\n- Use your smartphone to record your PSA\n- Find a quiet location with good lighting\n- Position your phone horizontally (landscape mode)\n- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace\n- Keep your video exactly 60 seconds (practice timing beforehand)\n- Check that your audio is clear and background noise is minimal\n\n**Upload Instructions:**\n1. Save your video file with the naming format: \"LastName_FirstName_MindsetPSA\"\n2. Upload your completed video to the designated submission area in the course\n3. Include a brief caption (1-2 sentences) that summarizes your PSA's main message\n\n## Example PSA Outline\n\nHere's a sample structure to help you plan your PSA:\n\n**0:00-0:10** - Hook statement to grab attention\n> \"Did you know that your brain physically changes every time you learn something new? That's right - your intelligence isn't fixed; it grows!\"\n\n**0:10-0:30** - Brief personal story\n> \"Last year, I struggled with algebra and thought I just wasn't a 'math person.' Instead of giving up, I started saying 'I can't do this YET' and broke problems into smaller steps. After two months of consistent effort, I improved from a D to a B+.\"\n\n**0:30-0:50** - One actionable tip with explanation\n> \"My tip for developing your growth mindset is to change your self-talk. When you catch yourself thinking 'I can't do this,' add the word 'yet' to the end. This simple word transforms a fixed mindset statement into a growth mindset opportunity.\"\n\n**0:50-1:00** - Closing statement\n> \"Remember, your abilities aren't set in stone. With effort and the right strategies, you can grow your skills in any area. What will you add 'yet' to today?\"\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nYour PSA will be evaluated on:\n- Inclusion of all required elements (hook, personal story, actionable tip)\n- Clear communication of growth mindset principles\n- Adherence to the 60-second time limit\n- Technical quality (audio clarity, appropriate lighting)\n- Authenticity and engagement\n\nRemember to review your video before submitting to ensure it meets all requirements. Good luck creating your mindset PSA!",
