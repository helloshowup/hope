The coach mentioned Jaime needed to improve ball-handling skills and defensive footwork. Jaime feels embarrassed and is considering giving up basketball altogether.\n\n## What would be the most effective mindset shift for Jaime?\n\nA) \"I'm just not athletic enough for basketball. I should find something else I'm naturally good at.\"\nB) \"The coach was unfair. I played better than some people who made the team.\"\nC) \"This feedback shows exactly what I need to practice. I can work on these skills and try again next season.\"\nD) \"I'll just focus on a different sport where I don't need those specific skills.\"\n\n## Feedback\nThe optimal answer is C. This response demonstrates a growth mindset by viewing the setback as information rather than failure. Jaime recognizes that skills can be developed through dedicated practice, embraces the coach's feedback as a roadmap for improvement, and maintains persistence toward the goal. This mindset shift transforms disappointment into an opportunity for growth.",
