# Goal-Clarity Rubric

## Overview
The Goal-Clarity Rubric is an AI-powered tool designed to evaluate your academic goals and provide immediate feedback on their effectiveness. This rubric analyzes three critical components of your goals:

1. **Specificity**: How clearly defined is your goal? (Example: "Complete Algebra 1 with a B+ or higher" vs. "Do better in math")
2. **Measurability**: Can progress toward your goal be tracked and measured? (Example: "Read 20 pages daily" vs. "Read more")
3. **Timeline**: Does your goal include a realistic deadline? (Example: "Submit all Unit 3 assignments by Friday" vs. "Finish soon")

## How It Works
1. Submit your academic goal in the provided text box
2. The AI evaluates your goal against the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
3. Receive an instant score and specific feedback
4. If your score falls below mastery level (80%), you'll receive suggestions and a link to revise and resubmit your goal

## Benefits for Excel High School Students

- Create more effective academic targets that support sustained effort
- Practice a valuable skill that applies to both academic and career success
- Receive immediate feedback to improve your goal-setting approach

**Pro Tip:** Before submitting, ask yourself: "Would someone else know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish, how I'll measure success, and when I plan to achieve it?"
