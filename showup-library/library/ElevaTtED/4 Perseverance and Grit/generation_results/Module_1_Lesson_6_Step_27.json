Today, we'll practice highlighting examples of perseverance in stories to better understand how people demonstrate grit in challenging situations.\n\n## Instructor Demonstration: Annotating for Perseverance\n\n### Sample Story: \"The Marathon Runner\"\n\n*After months of training through rain and snow, Maria arrived at the starting line of her first marathon. At mile 15, she felt a sharp pain in her knee. Many runners would have stopped, but Maria remembered her grandfather's words: \"Pain is temporary, achievement lasts forever.\" She adjusted her stride and continued. When she hit mile 20, exhaustion threatened to overwhelm her. Maria focused on taking one step at a time, counting her breaths, and visualizing the finish line. Three hours and forty-two minutes after starting, Maria crossed the finish line with tears of joy streaming down her face.*\n\n**Watch as I highlight examples of perseverance:**\n- \ud83d\udfe8 \"months of training through rain and snow\" - *Shows dedication despite obstacles*\n- \ud83d\udfe8 \"felt a sharp pain in her knee\" - *Identifies the challenge*\n- \ud83d\udfe8 \"adjusted her stride and continued\" - *Shows adaptation to overcome*\n- \ud83d\udfe8 \"focused on taking one step at a time\" - *Mental strategy for perseverance*\n- \ud83d\udfe8 \"visualizing the finish line\" - *Goal-oriented thinking*\n\n## Your Turn: Annotation Practice\n\nNow it's your turn to practice annotation using our online highlighter tool. Read the following story and highlight examples of perseverance strategies, challenges faced, and moments of grit.\n\n### Practice Story: \"The Science Project\"\n\n*Jamal had two weeks to complete his science project, but he procrastinated until three days before the deadline. When he finally started, he realized the experiment required materials he didn't have. Instead of giving up, Jamal called five different stores until he found what he needed. He stayed up late for two nights, making mistakes and starting over multiple times. When his experiment failed on the final night, Jamal took a deep breath, reviewed his notes, and identified the error. With only hours remaining, he rebuilt his project, finished his presentation, and arrived at school tired but prepared. His teacher was impressed not only with the project but with Jamal's honest reflection about the importance of time management.*\n\n## Reflection Questions\nAfter completing your annotation:\n1. What specific strategies did the character use to persevere?\n2. How did the character's mindset contribute to their success?\n3. What similarities do you see between the two stories?\n4. How might you apply these perseverance strategies in your own life?\n\nRemember, identifying perseverance strategies in stories helps us recognize and develop these qualities in ourselves!\n</educational_content>",

Today, we'll focus on highlighting examples of perseverance in stories. By marking these examples, we can better understand how characters demonstrate grit and determination in challenging situations.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Learn how to annotate text to identify examples of perseverance\n- Practice recognizing language that signals determination and grit\n- Apply annotation skills to analyze real-world stories\n\n## Instructor Demonstration: \"The Marathon Runner\"\n\nI'll first demonstrate how to annotate a story for perseverance cues. Watch as I highlight and explain my thinking process.\n\n**The Marathon Runner**\n*Maria had trained for six months for this marathon. On race day, the temperature soared to 90 degrees. By mile 15, her legs felt like lead and her water bottle was empty. \"I can't give up now,\" she thought, remembering all those early morning training runs. When a cramp seized her calf at mile 20, she stopped, stretched, and continued at a slower pace. Though many runners were dropping out, Maria focused on putting one foot in front of the other. When she finally crossed the finish line\u2014three hours later than her goal time\u2014she smiled through her exhaustion. Completing the race mattered more than her time.*\n\n### My Annotation Process:\n- I highlighted \"trained for six months\" because it shows Maria's long-term commitment\n- I highlighted \"I can't give up now\" as it demonstrates her determination when facing difficulty\n- I highlighted \"stopped, stretched, and continued\" because it shows how she adapted to overcome an obstacle\n- I highlighted \"putting one foot in front of the other\" as it illustrates her focus on small steps to achieve a larger goal\n- I highlighted \"Completing the race mattered more than her time\" because it shows her perseverance toward the main goal despite setbacks\n\n## Your Turn: \"The Science Project\"\n\nNow it's your turn! Using our online highlighter tool, read the following story and highlight examples of perseverance. Look for:\n- Actions that show determination\n- Thoughts that demonstrate grit\n- Strategies used to overcome obstacles\n- Moments of persistence despite difficulty\n\nAfter highlighting, we'll discuss what you found and why these examples demonstrate perseverance.\n\n**The Science Project**\n*Jamal had three weeks to complete his science project, but he waited until the last weekend to start. When his experiment failed on Saturday, panic set in. Instead of giving up, he called his teacher for advice. Sunday morning, he woke up early and tried a new approach. The second attempt didn't work either, but Jamal kept adjusting his variables. After his fifth try and well past midnight, his project finally worked. Exhausted but proud, he carefully recorded his data and prepared his presentation. Though he promised himself never to procrastinate again, Jamal learned that persistence could overcome even self-created obstacles.*\n</educational_content>",

This skill will help you recognize perseverance strategies in real-world situations.\n\n## What is Annotation?\nAnnotation is a reading strategy where we mark important parts of a text to help us understand it better. When we highlight examples of perseverance, we're training ourselves to recognize what persistence looks like in action.\n\n## Instructor Demonstration: Annotating for Perseverance\n\n### Sample Story: \"The Marathon Runner\"\n\n> Maria had trained for six months for the city marathon. On race day, the weather turned stormy with heavy rain. At mile 15, she developed a painful blister on her foot. Though she considered quitting, Maria remembered her training goal to finish no matter what. She slowed her pace but kept moving forward. When she finally crossed the finish line three hours later, her shoes were soaked, but her smile was bright.\n\n**Watch as I highlight examples of perseverance:**\n- \"trained for six months\" (showing long-term commitment)\n- \"developed a painful blister\" (facing an obstacle)\n- \"considered quitting\" (acknowledging the challenge)\n- \"remembered her training goal\" (using motivation technique)\n- \"slowed her pace but kept moving forward\" (adapting strategy)\n- \"finally crossed the finish line\" (achieving goal despite difficulties)\n\nNotice how I identified both the challenges Maria faced AND the strategies she used to overcome them.\n\n## Your Turn: Practice Annotation\n\n### Story: \"The Science Project\"\n\n> Alex had only two weeks to complete his science project. After his first experiment failed completely, he felt discouraged. His classmates seemed so far ahead. That night, he made a schedule breaking the project into small daily tasks. When his second attempt also didn't work, he asked his teacher for feedback instead of giving up. Working through lunch periods and after school, Alex completed his project just in time. Though it wasn't perfect, he was proud that he had pushed through the difficulties.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Read the story carefully first\n2. Use the online highlighter tool to mark:\n   - Challenges or obstacles faced (highlight in yellow)\n   - Perseverance strategies used (highlight in green)\n   - Results of perseverance (highlight in blue)\n3. After highlighting, reflect: Which strategy from the story could you apply to a challenge in your own life?\n\n## Why This Matters\nLearning to identify perseverance strategies in stories helps us build our own \"perseverance toolkit\" that we can use when facing challenges. The more strategies we recognize, the more options we have when we need to persist through difficult situations in school, sports, or personal goals.\n\n## Next Steps\nAfter completing this annotation exercise, we'll discuss the different strategies we identified and create our class \"Perseverance Strategy Guide\" that everyone can reference when facing challenges.\n</educational_content>"
