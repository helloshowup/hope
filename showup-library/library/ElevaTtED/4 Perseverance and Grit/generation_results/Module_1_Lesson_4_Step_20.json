    "<educational_content>\n# Goal-Clarity Rubric\n\nThe Goal-Clarity Rubric is an AI-powered assessment tool designed to evaluate the quality of your academic goals. When you submit a goal, the AI analyzes three critical components:\n\n1. **Specificity**: How clearly defined is your goal?\n2. **Measurability**: Can progress toward your goal be tracked?\n3. **Timeline**: Does your goal include a realistic timeframe?\n\nAfter submission, you'll receive an instant score with detailed feedback. Goals meeting mastery criteria (80% or higher) are approved. If your score falls below mastery, you'll receive a link to revise and resubmit your goal with specific improvement suggestions.\n\nThis process ensures your academic goals follow SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), setting you up for sustained effort and success.\n</educational_content>",
