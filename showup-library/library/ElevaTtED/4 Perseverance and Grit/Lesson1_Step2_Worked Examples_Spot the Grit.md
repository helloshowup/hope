# 4.2 Worked Examples—Spot the Grit

## Introduction
In this lesson, we'll analyze two real-life situations to identify signs of perseverance and grit. By recognizing these qualities in action, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how they appear in everyday life and how you can apply them to your own challenges.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify specific behaviors that demonstrate grit and perseverance
- Analyze how individuals overcome obstacles through sustained effort
- Apply these concepts to reflect on your own experiences with perseverance

## Vignette 1: The Marathon Runner

> Maya decided to run a marathon despite never having run more than a mile before. <span style="background-color: yellow">She created a six-month training plan</span> and began waking up at 5 AM daily. <span style="background-color: orange">During month three, she developed shin splints but consulted a physical therapist instead of quitting</span>. She modified her training but <span style="background-color: yellow">continued working toward her goal</span>. On race day, <span style="background-color: orange">at mile 20, she hit "the wall" where her body wanted to stop, but she pushed through</span> by focusing on her breathing and remembering her training journey. <span style="background-color: yellow">She finished the marathon in just under 5 hours</span>, achieving her personal goal.

## Vignette 2: The Coding Student

> Jamal enrolled in a coding bootcamp with no prior experience. <span style="background-color: yellow">He spent two hours every evening after work practicing</span>, even when tired. <span style="background-color: orange">When his first project received critical feedback, he felt discouraged but asked his instructor for additional guidance</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow">He revised his approach and put in extra weekend hours</span> to improve. <span style="background-color: orange">During the final project, his computer crashed, losing three days of work. Instead of panicking, he took a deep breath, retrieved what he could from backups, and rebuilt the rest</span>. <span style="background-color: yellow">He graduated with a portfolio strong enough to land a junior developer position</span>.

### Pause and Think
How did Jamal's response to setbacks demonstrate grit? What patterns do you notice in how he approached challenges?

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>

- People with grit:
  - Set long-term goals and create plans to achieve them
  - Maintain consistent effort over time

  - Manage their emotions during challenges
  - Focus on what they can control

## Your Turn: Personal Reflection
Think about your own life. Can you identify a situation where you've shown grit similar to Maya or Jamal? 

In your reflection, consider:
1. What was your long-term goal?
2. What obstacles did you face?
3. How did you respond to these challenges?
4. What specific actions demonstrated your perseverance?
5. What did you learn from this experience that you can apply to future challenges?

*Remember: Developing grit is a process. Even identifying small moments of perseverance in your life can help you build this important quality over time.*
