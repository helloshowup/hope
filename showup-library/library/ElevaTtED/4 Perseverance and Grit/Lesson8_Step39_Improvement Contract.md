## Guidelines for Selecting and Working with an Accountability Partner

### Choosing Your Accountability Partner
* Select someone you trust and respect (parent, guardian, friend, Excel Success Coach)
* Choose someone who will be honest with you, even when it's difficult
* Your partner should be reliable and available for scheduled check-ins
* Consider someone who has demonstrated grit in their own life

### Working Effectively with Your Accountability Partner

1. **Schedule regular check-ins** - Mark these dates on both your calendars and commit to them. For Excel students juggling multiple responsibilities, consider using your Student Portal calendar.

2. **Be transparent** - Share both successes and challenges honestly.

3. **Focus on metrics** - Discuss measurable progress rather than just feelings. For example: "I completed 3 assignments this week" instead of "I feel like I'm doing better."

4. **Request specific feedback** - Ask your partner to point out blind spots or areas where you may be making excuses.

5. **Celebrate milestones** - Acknowledge progress together, even small improvements.

6. **Reset when necessary** - If you fall short, work with your partner to understand why and adjust your approach.

## Examples to Get You Started

**Sample Area for Improvement:** "Completing my Excel coursework consistently without procrastination"

**Sample Actions:**
1. Set aside specific study times on my calendar (Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 7-8:30 PM)
2. Break large assignments into smaller tasks with deadlines
3. Turn off notifications on my phone during study sessions

**Sample Measurement:** "Track the number of days I study for at least 45 minutes; aim for 5 days per week"

Remember that this contract is a living document. You can revise your goals and metrics as you learn more about yourself and what works for you. The important part is maintaining your commitment to growth and perseverance in your Excel High School journey.
