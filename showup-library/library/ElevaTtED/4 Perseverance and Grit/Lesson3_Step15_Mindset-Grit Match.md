# Mindset-Grit Match

## Learning Objective:
By the end of this activity, you will be able to distinguish between fixed and growth mindset statements and understand how mindset affects learning persistence.

## Activity Instructions:
In this activity, you'll identify whether each statement reflects a **fixed mindset** or a **growth mindset**. Drag each statement to the correct category.

## Before You Begin:
Remember that a **growth mindset** views abilities as developable through effort and learning, while a **fixed mindset** sees abilities as static traits that cannot be changed significantly.

## Statements:
1. "I can improve my skills through hard work and practice."
2. "Some people are just naturally good at things; you either have talent or you don't."
3. "When I face challenges, it means I need to try different strategies."
4. "If something is difficult for me, it probably means I'm not cut out for it."
5. "Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow."
6. "Intelligence is something you're born with that doesn't change much."

## Categories:
- **Fixed Mindset**
- **Growth Mindset**
