Included examples of triggers and coping strategies to help students understand what's expected and jumpstart their thinking.\n\n3. Added a new \"Excel Resources\" section (Part 3) that explicitly connects students to the school's support systems mentioned in the learner profile (BRYTE AI Tutor, Success Coach Pro, etc.).\n\n4. Suggested including Excel staff in the support network section to encourage students to utilize institutional resources.\n\n5. Added a \"Plan Review Date\" section to reinforce the idea that resilience planning is an ongoing process.\n\n6. Reorganized the numbering of sections to accommodate the new content.\n\n7. Enhanced the introduction and conclusion to better frame the purpose of the worksheet within the context of online learning at Excel High School.\n\nThese changes better align the worksheet with the learner profile by addressing the needs of self-paced learners across different segments, incorporating Excel's platform features, and supporting the key instructional design drivers, particularly self-direction aids and flexibility with structure."
