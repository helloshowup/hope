Use these prompts to identify fixed mindset thoughts you've had:\n\n1. When starting a new Excel High School course, I often think...\n2. When I receive feedback on an assignment, my first thought is...\n3. When I see other students succeeding where I struggle, I tell myself...\n4.

Write down:\n1. The potential fixed mindset thoughts that might arise\n2. The growth mindset statements you'll use instead\n3. One specific action you'll take to support your growth mindset\n\n## Self-Rating Scale: Mindset Confidence\n\nAfter completing your mindset swaps, rate your confidence in using growth mindset thinking:\n\n1 = **Beginner**: I understand the concept but find it difficult to apply\n2 = **Developing**: I sometimes catch myself in fixed mindset thinking\n3 = **Practicing**: I regularly identify fixed thoughts and can reframe them\n4 = **Confident**: I naturally think with a growth mindset in most situations\n5 = **Expert**: I consistently maintain a growth mindset and help others develop one\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\n* Which fixed mindset phrase do you find yourself thinking most often during your online learning?\n* How might adopting growth mindset thinking help you persevere through challenges in your Excel High School courses?\n* What specific resources at Excel High School (Success Coach Pro, BRYTE AI Tutor, Writing Lab) could help support your growth mindset?\n* How can you apply growth mindset thinking to manage your self-paced learning schedule?\n\n## Next Steps\n\nShare one of your mindset swaps with your Success Coach or parent/guardian.

Be patient with yourself as you practice these new thought patterns in your Excel High School journey!",
