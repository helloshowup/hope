This process will help you refine your goals and build a supportive learning community.\n\n**Part 1: Post Your Goal (Due: [specific date])**\nCreate a specific academic goal using the SMART criteria:\n- **S**pecific: Clearly define what you want to accomplish\n- **M**easurable: Include concrete criteria to measure progress\n- **A**chievable: Make sure it's realistic given your resources and constraints\n- **R**elevant: Ensure it aligns with your educational priorities\n- **T**ime-bound: Set a deadline for completion\n\nPost your goal to the discussion board, explaining:\n- What your goal is\n- Why it matters to you\n- How you plan to achieve it (specific action steps)\n- When you expect to accomplish it\n- How you'll track your progress\n\n**Example:** \"I will improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of this quarter by completing 30 minutes of practice problems every day, attending weekly tutoring sessions, and reviewing my notes before each test.\"\n\n**Part 2: Peer Feedback (Due: [specific date])**\nRespond to at least two of your classmates' goals, offering constructive feedback using the rubric below.\n\n### Feedback Rubric\nWhen reviewing your peers' goals, evaluate them based on these three criteria:\n\n1. **SMART Elements** - Does the goal include all SMART components? Is it specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound?\n   - *Suggestion:* \"Your goal to 'study more' could be more specific. Consider changing it to 'study biology for 45 minutes each day.'\"\n\n2. **Action Steps** - Are the steps to achieve the goal clear and realistic? Are there potential obstacles that haven't been addressed?\n   - *Suggestion:* \"You might want to add a plan for what to do if work commitments make it difficult to study on certain days.\"\n\n3. **Accountability** - Has your peer included ways to track progress and stay accountable?\n   - *Suggestion:* \"Consider using a study tracking app or creating a simple chart to monitor your daily progress.\"\n\n### Netiquette Reminder\nRemember to maintain respectful communication when providing feedback:\n- Focus on the goal, not the person\n- Begin with positive observations before suggesting improvements\n- Offer specific, actionable suggestions rather than vague criticism\n- Use a supportive tone that encourages growth\n- Ask thoughtful questions that prompt deeper reflection\n\n### Grading\nThis assignment is worth [X points]:\n- Goal post meeting all requirements: [X points]\n- Two peer feedback responses meeting rubric criteria: [X points each]\n- Following netiquette guidelines: [X points]\n\nYour participation in this activity helps create a community of learners who support each other's academic success while developing essential goal-setting skills you can use throughout your educational journey at Excel High School and beyond.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the assignment's clarity, structure, and educational effectiveness:\n\n1. Added clear SMART goal explanations with brief definitions of each component\n2. Included a concrete example of a SMART goal to model expectations\n3. Added specific due dates placeholders to establish clear timeframes\n4. Enhanced the feedback rubric with example suggestions to demonstrate quality feedback\n5. Added a grading section with point allocation to clarify expectations and motivate participation\n6. Improved formatting with more consistent visual hierarchy and emphasis on key elements\n7. Added specific mention of tracking progress in the goal requirements\n8. Connected the assignment's relevance to Excel High School and future educational endeavors\n9. Maintained the original assignment structure while making it more accessible for all learner segments\n\nThese changes address the needs of both traditional achievers who need clear structure and adult learners who benefit from practical relevance, while supporting \"second-chance\" learners with scaffolded examples and clear expectations."
