  "edit_summary": "I made the following improvements to enhance the learning experience:\n\n1. Added comprehensive feedback for ALL answer options (not just incorrect ones) to provide valuable learning regardless of student response\n2. Made the feedback more specific and educational by explaining WHY each factor matters, not just stating which section to review\n3. Removed the \"Feedback if incorrect\" label which can feel discouraging and replaced with neutral \"Feedback\"\n4. Added a personal reflection prompt at the end to help students connect the content to their own experiences, supporting deeper learning and application\n5. Maintained clear organization with consistent formatting throughout\n6. Ensured language is accessible for all Excel High School learner segments while maintaining educational rigor\n\nThese changes support Universal Design for Learning principles by providing richer explanation and encouraging personal connection to the material."
