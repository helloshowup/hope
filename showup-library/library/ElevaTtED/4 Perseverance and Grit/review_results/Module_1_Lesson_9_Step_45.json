  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational value for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Renamed \"Automated Scoring\" to \"Scoring Guide\" to avoid confusion about how the portfolio will be evaluated.\n\n2. Expanded the scoring criteria descriptions to provide more specific guidance on what constitutes excellence in each category.\n\n3. Added a \"Submission and Feedback\" section with a more realistic feedback timeline (3 business days instead of 24 hours) and information about support resources.\n\n4. Added a \"Pro Tip\" to encourage students to use the rubric as a self-assessment tool during portfolio creation.\n\n5. Improved formatting for better readability, particularly in the scoring table.\n\nThese changes better support the diverse learner segments at Excel High School, especially \"Second-Chance Learners\" who need clear expectations and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who benefit from practical guidance and flexibility."
