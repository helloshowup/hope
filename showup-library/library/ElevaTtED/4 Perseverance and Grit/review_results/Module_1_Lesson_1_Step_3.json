  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational effectiveness:\n\n1. Expanded the word count range to 150-200 words to give students slightly more flexibility while maintaining conciseness\n2. Added a \"Before You Begin\" section with clear definitions of key concepts to ensure students understand the difference between perseverance and grit\n3. Added specific submission timeline placeholders for instructors to customize\n4. Added paragraph length guidance for peer responses (2-3 paragraphs)\n5. Included a \"Success Tip\" with a practical suggestion for writing and proofreading\n6. Improved formatting with better spacing and visual organization\n7. Made the instructions more direct and action-oriented\n8. Maintained the original structure while enhancing clarity and support elements\n\nThese changes better support Excel High School's diverse learner segments, particularly \"Second-Chance Learners\" who need clear structure and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who benefit from practical guidance. The improvements align with the school's instructional design drivers, especially \"Scaffold & Spiral\" and \"Self-Direction Aids.\""
