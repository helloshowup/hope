This skill will help you recognize perseverance strategies in real-world situations and apply them to your own challenges.\n\n## What is Annotation?\nAnnotation is a reading strategy where we mark important parts of a text to help us understand it better. When we highlight examples of perseverance, we're training ourselves to recognize what persistence looks like in action.\n\n## Instructor Demonstration: Annotating for Perseverance\n\n### Sample Story: \"The Marathon Runner\"\n\n> Maria had trained for six months for the city marathon. On race day, the weather turned stormy with heavy rain. At mile 15, she developed a painful blister on her foot. Though she considered quitting, Maria remembered her training goal to finish no matter what. She slowed her pace but kept moving forward. When she finally crossed the finish line three hours later, her shoes were soaked, but her smile was bright.\n\n**Watch as I highlight examples of perseverance:**\n- \"trained for six months\" (showing long-term commitment)\n- \"developed a painful blister\" (facing an obstacle)\n- \"considered quitting\" (acknowledging the challenge)\n- \"remembered her training goal\" (using motivation technique)\n- \"slowed her pace but kept moving forward\" (adapting strategy)\n- \"finally crossed the finish line\" (achieving goal despite difficulties)\n\nNotice how I identified both the challenges Maria faced AND the strategies she used to overcome them. This dual focus helps us understand not just what makes something difficult, but how we can respond effectively.\n\n## Your Turn: Practice Annotation\n\n### Story: \"The Science Project\"\n\n> Alex had only two weeks to complete his science project. After his first experiment failed completely, he felt discouraged. His classmates seemed so far ahead. That night, he made a schedule breaking the project into small daily tasks. When his second attempt also didn't work, he asked his teacher for feedback instead of giving up. Working through lunch periods and after school, Alex completed his project just in time. Though it wasn't perfect, he was proud that he had pushed through the difficulties.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Read the story carefully first\n2. Use the online highlighter tool to mark:\n   - Challenges or obstacles faced (highlight in yellow)\n   - Perseverance strategies used (highlight in green)\n   - Results of perseverance (highlight in blue)\n3. After highlighting, reflect on these questions:\n   - Which strategy from the story could you apply to a challenge in your own life?\n   - What other strategies might have helped Alex?\n   - How did Alex's mindset change from the beginning to the end of the story?\n\n## Why This Matters\nLearning to identify perseverance strategies in stories helps us build our own \"perseverance toolkit\" that we can use when facing challenges. The more strategies we recognize, the more options we have when we need to persist through difficult situations in school, sports, or personal goals.\n\nResearch shows that perseverance (sometimes called \"grit\") is one of the strongest predictors of success in education and careers. By practicing this skill now, you're developing a valuable life skill.\n\n## Next Steps\nAfter completing this annotation exercise:\n1. Submit your highlighted story through the assignment portal\n2. Respond to the reflection questions in the discussion forum\n3. Review the class \"Perseverance Strategy Guide\" that we'll create from everyone's contributions\n4. Consider how you might apply these strategies to your current coursework at Excel High School\n\n## Additional Resources\n* Video: \"The Power of Perseverance\" (3:45) - Available in the Resources section\n* Interactive quiz: \"What's Your Perseverance Style?\" - Optional extension activity\n* Need help with the highlighting tool?

  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the lesson while maintaining its core structure:\n\n1. Expanded the learning objective to explicitly mention application to personal challenges\n2. Added more context to the instructor demonstration to explain why identifying both challenges and strategies matters\n3. Enhanced the reflection questions to promote deeper thinking and personal connection\n4. Added research-based information about why perseverance matters for educational success\n5. Created a more structured \"Next Steps\" section with clear action items specific to Excel High School\n6. Added an \"Additional Resources\" section with supplementary materials and support options\n7. Incorporated references to Excel High School's support systems (Success Coach, assignment portal)\n8. Improved overall flow with better transitions between sections\n9. Added more explicit instructions for the reflection component to support different learning styles\n\nThese changes better align with Excel's competency-based approach, provide clearer structure for self-pacing, and incorporate UDL principles by offering multiple means of engagement and expression."
