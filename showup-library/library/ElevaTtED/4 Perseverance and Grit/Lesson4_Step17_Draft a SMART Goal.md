# Draft a SMART Goal

## Introduction
Setting effective goals is a crucial skill for academic success. SMART goals provide a structured framework that helps you create clear, achievable objectives. In this activity, you'll learn to craft your own SMART goal to support your academic journey at Excel High School.

## What is a SMART Goal?

A SMART goal is:
- **S**pecific: Clearly defined and focused
- **M**easurable: Includes concrete criteria to track progress
- **A**chievable: Realistic and attainable
- **R**elevant: Aligned with your broader objectives
- **T**ime-bound: Has a defined timeline or deadline

## Instructor Model

**Example SMART Goal:**
"I will improve my math grade from a C to a B by completing all homework assignments, attending two tutoring sessions per week, and studying for 30 minutes daily, to be achieved by the end of the current quarter."

Notice how this goal is:
- **Specific**: Focuses on math grade improvement
- **Measurable**: From C to B grade
- **Achievable**: Uses realistic strategies (homework, tutoring, daily study)
- **Relevant**: Directly relates to academic success at Excel High School
- **Time-bound**: By the end of the quarter
