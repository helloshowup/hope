When you learn something new or practice a skill, your brain physically changes by:\n\n- Creating new neural connections\n- Strengthening existing pathways\n- Adapting to new challenges\n\nThis is called **neuroplasticity**, and it means your brain can literally grow stronger with effort and practice. Just like a muscle gets stronger when you exercise it, your brain develops when you challenge it.\n\n## Mapping Mindsets to Behaviors\n\n| Fixed Mindset Belief | Resulting Behavior | Growth Mindset Belief | Resulting Behavior |\n|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| \"I'm not good at math.\" | Avoids math challenges, gives up quickly | \"Math takes practice, and I can improve.\" | Tackles problems persistently, seeks help when needed |\n| \"I'll never be athletic.\" | Sits out during physical activities | \"With training, I can develop my physical abilities.\" | Participates fully, focuses on personal improvement |\n| \"Making mistakes means I'm failing.\" | Hides mistakes, becomes defensive | \"Mistakes help me learn and grow.\" | Analyzes errors, adjusts approach, tries again |\n| \"If it's hard, I can't do it.\" | Gives up when facing obstacles | \"Challenges help me develop my abilities.\" | Persists through difficulties, tries different strategies |\n\n## Real-Life Examples\n\n**Example 1: Learning a New Skill**\n- **Fixed Mindset Response:** \"I missed the basket again. I'm just not coordinated enough for basketball.\"\n- **Growth Mindset Response:** \"My shooting technique needs work. I'll practice 20 shots daily and ask the coach for tips.\"\n\n**Example 2: Tackling a Difficult Assignment**\n- **Fixed Mindset Response:** \"This assignment is too hard. Some people just aren't good writers.\"\n- **Growth Mindset Response:** \"This is challenging, but I can break it down into smaller parts. I'll start with an outline and seek feedback.\"\n\n**Example 3: Learning Online**\n- **Fixed Mindset Response:** \"I'm not good at self-paced learning. I'll probably fall behind.\"\n- **Growth Mindset Response:** \"Online learning requires different skills. I'll use the calendar tool to set deadlines and reach out to my Success Coach when I need help.\"\n\n## Apply It: Your Turn to Practice\n\n**In your notes, respond to the following prompts:**\n\n1. Think about a recent challenge you faced in school or work. How did your mindset affect how you approached it?\n\n2. Identify one area where you tend to have a fixed mindset. What specific beliefs do you hold?\n\n3. Rewrite those fixed mindset thoughts as growth mindset statements.\n\n4. What specific actions could you take this week to demonstrate perseverance in this area?\n\n5. How might your results change if you consistently applied a growth mindset?\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Your mindset isn't just about positive thinking\u2014it directly influences your actions, which determine your results.\n\n- The link between mindset and perseverance is powerful. When you believe your abilities can grow through effort, you're more likely to persist through challenges.\n\n- Neuroplasticity means your brain physically changes and grows stronger when you challenge yourself and practice new skills.\n\n- You can intentionally shift from a fixed to a growth mindset by recognizing fixed mindset thoughts and reframing them.\n\n**Remember:** At Excel High School, developing a growth mindset is essential for success in our self-paced learning environment.
