  "final_content": "# Evaluate Two Scenarios: Demonstrating Grit\n\nRead the two scenarios below and determine which student demonstrates stronger grit.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\nMia struggled with algebra all semester. After failing her midterm, she felt discouraged but created a study schedule, sought help from her teacher during lunch periods, and joined a study group. Though she still found the material challenging, she persisted with her plan for eight weeks. Her final grade improved from an F to a B-.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\nJordan received a C on his history project. He was disappointed and complained to friends that the teacher graded unfairly. For his next assignment, he put in extra effort the night before it was due and earned a B. Jordan was satisfied with this improvement and maintained his usual study habits afterward.\n\n**Reflection Questions:**\n1. Which student demonstrated stronger grit? Select one:\n   \u25cb Mia\n   \u25cb Jordan\n\n2. Explain your choice by identifying at least two specific behaviors that demonstrate grit:\n   [Text entry field]\n\n3. Think about your own academic journey. Describe a time when you demonstrated grit:\n   [Text entry field]\n\n**Key Elements of Grit:**\n* Perseverance over an extended period\n* Consistent effort despite challenges\n* Seeking resources and support\n* Working toward long-term improvement\n* Maintaining focus on goals despite setbacks\n\n**Sample Response:**\nMia demonstrated stronger grit by creating a systematic plan, seeking help from multiple sources, and maintaining consistent effort over an extended period (eight weeks) despite ongoing challenges. Her approach shows long-term commitment to improvement rather than a short-term reaction.",
