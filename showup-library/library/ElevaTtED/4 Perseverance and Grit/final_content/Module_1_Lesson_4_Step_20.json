This rubric analyzes three critical components of your goals:\n\n1. **Specificity**: How clearly defined is your goal? (Example: \"Complete Algebra 1 with a B+ or higher\" vs. \"Do better in math\")\n2. **Measurability**: Can progress toward your goal be tracked and measured? (Example: \"Read 20 pages daily\" vs. \"Read more\")\n3. **Timeline**: Does your goal include a realistic deadline? (Example: \"Submit all Unit 3 assignments by Friday\" vs. \"Finish soon\")\n\n## How It Works\n1. Submit your academic goal in the provided text box\n2. The AI evaluates your goal against the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)\n3. Receive an instant score and specific feedback\n4. If your score falls below mastery level (80%), you'll receive suggestions and a link to revise and resubmit your goal\n\n## Benefits for Excel High School Students\n- Develop stronger self-direction skills essential for asynchronous learning\n- Create more effective academic targets that support sustained effort\n- Practice a valuable skill that applies to both academic and career success\n- Receive immediate feedback to improve your goal-setting approach\n\n**Pro Tip:** Before submitting, ask yourself: \"Would someone else know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish, how I'll measure success, and when I plan to achieve it?\"",
