The coach mentioned Jaime needed to improve ball-handling skills and defensive footwork. Jaime feels embarrassed and is considering giving up basketball altogether.\n\n## Reflection Question\nWhat would be the most effective mindset shift for Jaime?\n\nA) \"I'm just not athletic enough for basketball. I should find something else I'm naturally good at.\"\nB) \"The coach was unfair. I played better than some people who made the team.\"\nC) \"This feedback shows exactly what I need to practice. I can work on these skills and try again next season.\"\nD) \"I'll just focus on a different sport where I don't need those specific skills.\"\n\n## Analysis\nThe optimal answer is C. This response demonstrates a growth mindset by viewing the setback as information rather than failure. Jaime recognizes that skills can be developed through dedicated practice, embraces the coach's feedback as a roadmap for improvement, and maintains persistence toward the goal.\n\n## Application\nThink about a recent setback you've experienced. In the text box below, describe:\n1. The situation\n2. Your initial reaction\n3. How you could reframe it using a growth mindset approach\n4. One specific action you could take to improve in this area\n\n*Remember: A growth mindset views challenges as opportunities to develop new abilities through effort and practice, not as evidence of fixed limitations.*",
