  "final_content": "# Mindset-Grit Match\n\n## Learning Objective:\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to distinguish between fixed and growth mindset statements and understand how mindset affects learning persistence.\n\n## Activity Instructions:\nIn this activity, you'll identify whether each statement reflects a **fixed mindset** or a **growth mindset**. Drag each statement to the correct category.\n\n## Before You Begin:\nRemember that a **growth mindset** views abilities as developable through effort and learning, while a **fixed mindset** sees abilities as static traits that cannot be changed significantly.\n\n## Statements:\n1. \"I can improve my skills through hard work and practice.\"\n2. \"Some people are just naturally good at things; you either have talent or you don't.\"\n3. \"When I face challenges, it means I need to try different strategies.\"\n4. \"If something is difficult for me, it probably means I'm not cut out for it.\"\n5. \"Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow.\"\n6. \"Intelligence is something you're born with that doesn't change much.\"\n\n## Categories:\n- **Fixed Mindset**\n- **Growth Mindset**\n\n## Success Criteria:\nTo pass this activity, you must correctly categorize at least 5 out of 6 statements (83%).\n\nIf you don't pass on your first attempt, you can retry with hints that will guide you toward the correct answers.\n\n## Why This Matters:\nUnderstanding your own mindset can help you develop greater resilience and persistence in your Excel High School courses and beyond.",
