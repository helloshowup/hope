# Evaluate Two Scenarios: Demonstrating Grit

Read the two scenarios below and determine which student demonstrates stronger grit.

**Scenario 1:**
Mia struggled with algebra all semester. After failing her midterm, she felt discouraged but created a study schedule, sought help from her teacher during lunch periods, and joined a study group. Though she still found the material challenging, she persisted with her plan for eight weeks. Her final grade improved from an F to a B-.

**Scenario 2:**
Jordan received a C on his history project. He was disappointed and complained to friends that the teacher graded unfairly. For his next assignment, he put in extra effort the night before it was due and earned a B. Jordan was satisfied with this improvement and maintained his usual study habits afterward.

**Reflection Questions:**
1. Which student demonstrated stronger grit? Select one:
   ○ Mia
   ○ Jordan

2. Explain your choice by identifying at least two specific behaviors that demonstrate grit:

**Key Elements of Grit:**
* Perseverance over an extended period
* Consistent effort despite challenges
* Seeking resources and support
* Working toward long-term improvement
* Maintaining focus on goals despite setbacks

**Sample Response:**
Mia demonstrated stronger grit by creating a systematic plan, seeking help from multiple sources, and maintaining consistent effort over an extended period (eight weeks) despite ongoing challenges. Her approach shows long-term commitment to improvement rather than a short-term reaction.
