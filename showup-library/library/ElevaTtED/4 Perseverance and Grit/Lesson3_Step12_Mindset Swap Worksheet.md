## Your Turn: Create Your Own Mindset Swaps

Think about times when you've experienced setbacks or challenges in your online learning journey. Use these prompts to identify fixed mindset thoughts you've had:

1. When starting a new Excel High School course, I often think...
2. When I receive feedback on an assignment, my first thought is...
3. When I see other students succeeding where I struggle, I tell myself...
4. When facing a difficult assessment or project, I believe...
5. When I don't understand something right away in my coursework, I think...

For each fixed mindset thought you identify, write a growth mindset alternative.

## Application to Your Learning

Choose one upcoming challenge in your Excel High School coursework (a difficult assignment, test, or concept). Write down:
1. The potential fixed mindset thoughts that might arise
2. The growth mindset statements you'll use instead
3. One specific action you'll take to support your growth mindset

## Self-Rating Scale: Mindset Confidence

After completing your mindset swaps, rate your confidence in using growth mindset thinking:

1 = **Beginner**: I understand the concept but find it difficult to apply
2 = **Developing**: I sometimes catch myself in fixed mindset thinking
3 = **Practicing**: I regularly identify fixed thoughts and can reframe them
4 = **Confident**: I naturally think with a growth mindset in most situations
5 = **Expert**: I consistently maintain a growth mindset and help others develop one
