# Select & Scope Your Initiative

# Select & Scope Your Kindness Initiative

## Introduction
Welcome to the planning phase of your kindness initiative! Creating meaningful change in your community begins with careful planning and clear goals. This guide will walk you through selecting and scoping a kindness initiative that matches your interests and can make a real difference.

## Step 1: Choose Your Kindness Initiative
Begin by brainstorming ideas for kindness initiatives that could positively impact your community. Consider:
- What issues or needs exist in your community?
- What kindness initiatives would address these needs?
- What are you passionate about?

**Activity:** In your digital notebook or a separate document:
1. List 3-5 possible kindness initiatives
2. For each idea, write 1-2 sentences about why it matters to you
3. Note how each idea might benefit others
4. Select the one that you feel most passionate about and believe will create the greatest positive impact

## Step 2: Identify Your Target Group
Determine who will benefit from your kindness initiative:
- Who specifically needs this support or kindness?
- How many people do you aim to reach?
- How will you connect with this group?

**Example:** If your initiative is a "Kindness Cards for Seniors" project, your target group might be "30 residents at Sunny Valley Retirement Home who receive few visitors."

**Quick Check:** Can you clearly describe who will benefit from your initiative and approximately how many people you hope to reach?

## Step 3: Set a SMART Goal
Create a goal that is:
- **Specific**: Clearly define what you will accomplish
- **Measurable**: Include quantities or indicators of progress
- **Achievable**: Be realistic about what you can accomplish
- **Relevant**: Ensure it relates to promoting kindness
- **Time-bound**: Set a specific timeframe

**Example SMART Goal:** "To create and deliver 50 handwritten kindness cards to seniors at Sunny Valley Retirement Home by December 15, bringing joy and connection to residents during the holiday season."

**Pro Tip:** If you're juggling work, family, or other commitments, make sure your timeline is realistic for your schedule. It's better to plan a smaller initiative you can complete successfully than a larger one that becomes overwhelming.

## Step 4: List Needed Resources
Identify everything you'll need to make your initiative successful:
- Materials and supplies
- Helpers or volunteers
- Space or locations
- Permissions or approvals
- Funding (if needed)

**Resource Planning Activity:** Create a simple table with three columns:
1. Resource needed
2. How to obtain it
3. Estimated cost (if any)

## Step 5: Create a Timeline
Develop a realistic schedule that includes:
- Planning phase (research, gathering resources)
- Preparation phase (creating materials, recruiting help)
- Implementation phase (the actual kindness activities)
- Follow-up phase (thank yous, reflection, evaluation)

Be sure to include specific dates for key milestones and completion.

**Time Management Tip:** Break larger tasks into smaller steps with their own mini-deadlines to make your initiative more manageable.

## Planning Worksheet
Use the following format to document your initiative plan:

1. **Selected Initiative**: [Your chosen kindness project]
2. **Target Group**: [Who will benefit and how many]
3. **SMART Goal**: [Your complete SMART goal]
4. **Resources Needed**: [List all required resources]
5. **Timeline**: [Key dates and milestones]
6. **Potential Challenges**: [Obstacles you might face and how you'll address them]
7. **Success Indicators**: [How you'll know your initiative made a difference]

Remember, a well-planned initiative has a much greater chance of success and creating meaningful impact in your community!

## Next Steps
Once you've completed your planning worksheet, you'll be ready to move on to implementing your kindness initiative. Before proceeding, take a moment to review your plan and make any necessary adjustments.

**Reflection Question:** How does your kindness initiative align with your personal values and interests while addressing a real need in your community?
