# Initiative Brainstorm Board

# Initiative Brainstorm Board

## Welcome to Our Kindness Initiative Forum!

In this collaborative space, we'll generate ideas for community initiatives that promote kindness. Your participation will help us identify meaningful projects we can implement together.

### Instructions:

1. **Share Your Ideas:** Post a reply listing THREE initiative ideas that could promote kindness in our community. For each idea:
   - Provide a brief description (2-3 sentences)
   - Tag each idea with a THEME (e.g., #environment, #seniors, #education, #mentalhealth)
   - Indicate the SCALE of each idea (#individual, #smallgroup, #wholeclass, #schoolwide, #community)

2. **Engage With Others:** Review your peers' ideas and interact with at least 3 posts by:
   - Liking ideas that resonate with you
   - Replying with constructive feedback or building upon their ideas
   - Asking thoughtful questions to help develop promising concepts

3. **Collaborative Development:** Our facilitator will summarize the most popular themes and ideas after everyone has participated, creating a shortlist of potential initiatives for further development.

### Tips for Success:
- **Time Management:** Set aside 20-30 minutes to develop your ideas and another 15-20 minutes to engage with peers' posts.
- **Be Specific:** The more detailed your initiative description, the easier it will be for others to understand and build upon.
- **Consider Resources:** Think about what resources (time, materials, support) would be needed to implement your ideas.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure your initiatives could include participants with diverse abilities and backgrounds.

Remember, effective initiatives can range from simple individual actions to complex community-wide projects. Be creative, practical, and considerate of available resources.

Let's brainstorm together and discover how we can make a meaningful difference through kindness!
