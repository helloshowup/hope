This challenge will help you develop a habit of kindness while making a positive impact in your community.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this challenge, you will:
- Design and implement a personalized kindness plan

### Step 1: Define Your Theme
Choose a theme that resonates with you. Your theme will guide your daily acts of kindness.

**Theme Ideas:**
- Supporting classmates and friends
- Helping family members
- Community service
- Environmental kindness
- Random acts of kindness
- Gratitude and appreciation
- Digital kindness (online positivity)

**My Kindness Challenge Theme:** _________________________________

### Step 2: Plan Daily Actions
Create seven specific, achievable kindness actions—one for each day of your challenge.

**Example Actions:**
- Write a thank-you note to someone who helped you
- Offer to help a family member with a chore they dislike
- Post a positive comment on someone's social media
- Pick up litter in your neighborhood

Now plan your own actions:

**Day 1:** _________________________________________________
**Day 2:** _________________________________________________
**Day 3:** _________________________________________________
**Day 4:** _________________________________________________
**Day 5:** _________________________________________________
**Day 6:** _________________________________________________
**Day 7:** _________________________________________________

### Step 3: Motivation Tips
Write three personal reminders to keep yourself motivated throughout the challenge:

1. _________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________

**Motivation Examples:**
- "Even small acts of kindness can make someone's day better."
- "I'm building positive habits that will benefit me long-term."
- "This challenge helps me connect with my community."

### Step 4: Create Your Success Tracker
Use the template below to track your progress. For each day, record:
- The kindness action you completed
- How it made you feel
- How others responded
- What you learned

| Day | Action Completed | How I Felt | Others' Response | What I Learned |
|-----|------------------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1   |                  |            |                  |                |
| 2   |                  |            |                  |                |
| 3   |                  |            |                  |                |
| 4   |                  |            |                  |                |
| 5   |                  |            |                  |                |
| 6   |                  |            |                  |                |
| 7   |                  |            |                  |                |
