## Video Script: "Five Simple Ways to Spread Kindness Every Day"

**[Opening shot: Presenter smiling at camera]**

PRESENTER: Welcome to our lesson on Daily Acts of Kindness! Today, I'm going to demonstrate five simple acts of kindness that you can easily incorporate into your daily routine. These small gestures can make a big difference in someone's day and help create a more positive environment for everyone.

**[On-screen text appears: "5 DAILY ACTS OF KINDNESS"]**

### Act #1: Give a Genuine Compliment

**[Presenter approaches another person]**

PRESENTER: The first act is giving a genuine compliment. Notice something positive about someone and let them know!

**[Presenter demonstrates]**: "Hi Sarah, I really appreciated how you helped organize the group project yesterday. Your ideas made our presentation so much better!"

**[On-screen text: "COMPLIMENT STEPS:
1. Be specific and sincere
2. Focus on actions or qualities, not just appearance
3. Deliver with eye contact and a smile"]**

**[Interactive checkpoint: "Think about someone in your life who deserves a compliment. What specific action or quality would you compliment them on?"]**

### Act #2: Help with a Task

**[Presenter notices someone carrying books/materials]**

PRESENTER: Our second act is helping someone with a task without being asked.

**[Presenter demonstrates]**: "Those look heavy! Can I help you carry some of those to your classroom?"

**[On-screen text: "HELPING STEPS:
1. Notice when someone might need assistance
2. Offer help specifically - don't just ask 'Need help?'
3. Respect their response if they decline"]**

**[Real-world application note: "This skill transfers to workplace and family settings where initiative is valued."]**

### Act #3: Write a Gratitude Note

**[Presenter sits at desk with notecard]**

PRESENTER: The third act is writing a quick note of thanks or appreciation.

**[Presenter demonstrates writing]**: "Dear Ms. Johnson, Thank you for staying after class to help me understand the assignment. I really appreciate your time and patience. Sincerely, Jamie."

**[On-screen text: "GRATITUDE NOTE TIPS:
1. Be specific about what you're thankful for
2. Keep it short but meaningful
3. Handwritten notes have special impact"]**

**[Digital alternative callout: "Digital version: A thoughtful email or text message can also be meaningful when a handwritten note isn't practical."]**

### Act #4: Share a Helpful Resource

**[Presenter with book/article/information]**

PRESENTER: Our fourth act is sharing a resource that might help someone else.

**[Presenter demonstrates]**: "Hey Miguel, I remembered you were looking for information about the science fair. I found this website that has great project ideas - I'll text you the link!"

**[On-screen text: "SHARING RESOURCES:
1. Match resources to specific needs
2. Share without expectation of return
3. Follow up to see if it was helpful"]**

**[Examples box: "Resources might include: articles, videos, apps, books, contact information, or community services."]**

### Act #5: Practice Active Listening

**[Presenter sitting with another person in conversation]**

PRESENTER: The fifth act is active listening - giving someone your full attention.

**[Presenter demonstrates nodding, maintaining eye contact, responding thoughtfully]**: "So you're saying you felt nervous about the presentation? That makes sense. Tell me more about how it went."

**[On-screen text: "ACTIVE LISTENING TECHNIQUES:
1. Put away distractions (especially phones)
2. Make eye contact and nod to show understanding
3. Ask follow-up questions instead of changing the subject"]**

**[Cultural awareness note: "In some cultures, direct eye contact may be considered disrespectful. Adapt your listening style to be culturally sensitive."]**

### Challenge Invitation

**[Presenter back to camera]**

PRESENTER: Now it's your turn! I challenge you to try at least one of these acts of kindness each day this week. Notice how it makes you feel and how others respond. Remember, kindness creates ripples that extend far beyond the initial act.

Start small, be consistent, and watch how these simple actions can transform your relationships and community. 

**[Reflection prompt appears: "How might these acts of kindness benefit you personally? How might they benefit your community?"]**

Next week, we'll share our experiences and the impact of our kindness challenge!

**[Final on-screen text: "KINDNESS CHALLENGE: Try one act each day this week!"]**
