# Create a “Kindness Snapshot” Collage

# Create a "Kindness Snapshot" Collage

## Overview
In this activity, you will create a visual representation of kindness in your community. By collecting images and words that illustrate acts of kindness you've observed or experienced, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how kindness and empathy appear in everyday life.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify examples of kindness in your daily environment
- Analyze the relationship between kindness and empathy
- Create a visual representation that communicates your understanding

## Materials Needed
- Kindness Snapshot Template (available in the Resources section below)
- Digital images or words representing kindness
- Computer or tablet with basic editing capabilities
- Alternative option: Paper, magazines, and glue for those who prefer a physical collage

## Time Required
- Approximately 45-60 minutes to complete

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template
Download the Kindness Snapshot Template from the Resources section below. This template provides a drag-and-drop grid where you can easily arrange your images and text.

**Alternative Option:** If you prefer to create a physical collage or have limited digital access, you may print the template and create your collage using paper, magazines, and glue.

### Step 2: Collect Your Kindness Examples
Gather 5 different examples that represent kindness in your local context:
- Take photos of kind acts you witness
- Find images that represent kindness to you
- Create text boxes with powerful words or quotes about kindness
- Include symbols that represent kindness in your culture or community

**Important:** Focus on examples from your own experience or community. These should be authentic representations of kindness that are meaningful to you.

**Pro Tip:** Consider different types of kindness - small everyday acts, organized community efforts, or moments of unexpected compassion.

### Step 3: Create Your Collage
1. Open the template on your device
2. Drag and drop your images into the grid
3. Resize and position elements as needed
4. Add a brief caption (1-2 sentences) beneath each image explaining:
   - What this example shows about kindness
   - Why you chose to include it

### Step 4: Add Your Reflection
At the bottom of your collage, answer this reflection question in 3-5 sentences:
"How do these examples show the connection between kindness and empathy in everyday life?"

### Step 5: Export and Submit
1. Save your completed collage as a JPG or PNG file
2. Make sure your name is included on the collage
3. Check that all 5 examples have captions
4. Verify your reflection question is answered
5. Upload your file to the submission area
