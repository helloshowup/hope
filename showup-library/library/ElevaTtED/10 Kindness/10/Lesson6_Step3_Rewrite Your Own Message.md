# Rewrite Your Own Message

# Rewrite Your Own Message

## Introduction
Communication is a powerful tool that can either strengthen or damage our relationships. When we communicate with compassion and respect, we create positive connections with others. This activity will help you practice rewriting your own messages to make them more compassionate and effective.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this activity, you will be able to identify elements of compassionate communication and apply them to improve your own messages.

## Guidelines for Compassionate Communication
When rewriting your message, consider these guidelines:
- **Use "I" statements** instead of accusatory "you" statements
- **Express your feelings** clearly but respectfully
- **State observations** rather than judgments
- **Make specific requests** instead of demands
- **Show empathy** for the other person's perspective
- **Focus on the issue**, not personal attacks
- **Offer solutions** when appropriate

## Activity Instructions
1. Think of a past message (email, text, social media post) that you sent when you were upset, frustrated, or angry. If you prefer not to use a real example, you can create a fictional scenario.
2. Remove any names or identifying information.
3. In the text box provided, share your original message.
4. Using the compassionate communication guidelines above, rewrite your message.
5. Submit both versions through the assignment portal.
6. Complete the reflection questions that follow.

## Example

**Original Message:**
"You never respond to my texts on time. You're so inconsiderate. I'm tired of always waiting around for you. Don't bother texting me back now."

**Revised Message:**
"I felt concerned when I didn't hear back from you earlier. When messages go unanswered for a while, I start to worry and feel a bit frustrated. In the future, I'd appreciate even a quick reply letting me know you're busy. How does that sound?"

## Reflection Questions
After completing your rewrite, consider these questions (please answer each one thoroughly):

1. How might the recipient's response differ between the original and revised messages?
2. What emotions were you feeling when you wrote the original message (or would feel in this scenario)?
3. How did reframing your words change the tone and potential impact?
4. Which version is more likely to lead to a productive conversation, and why?
5. How might you apply these communication techniques in your daily life?

## Submission Guidelines
- Your submission should include the original message, revised message, and answers to all reflection questions
- Aim for thoughtful, detailed responses that demonstrate your understanding of compassionate communication
- Your work will be evaluated on how effectively you applied the communication guidelines and the depth of your reflection

Remember, compassionate communication isn't about hiding your feelingsâ€”it's about expressing them in ways that promote understanding rather than defensiveness.
