# Redesign Proposal for Inclusion

# Redesign Proposal for Inclusion

## Lesson Objective
In this lesson, you will create a one-page proposal for redesigning a learning environment to be more inclusive. This document will serve as a portfolio artifact demonstrating your ability to design strategies for positive, inclusive learning environments.

## Creating Your Inclusion Redesign Proposal

### Step 1: Understanding the Template Components
Your one-page proposal should include these four key sections:

1. **Goals**: Clear statements about what your redesign aims to accomplish
2. **Redesign Sketch**: Visual representation of your proposed changes
3. **Resource List**: Materials, support, and tools needed
4. **Timeline**: Implementation schedule with key milestones

### Step 2: Developing Your Proposal Content

#### Goals Section
Write 3-5 specific, measurable goals that address:
- Physical accessibility improvements (e.g., wheelchair access, adjustable workstations)
- Cultural inclusivity enhancements (e.g., diverse representation in materials)
- Support for diverse learning needs (e.g., assistive technology options)
- Community building elements (e.g., collaborative spaces)

**Example Goal**: "Increase physical accessibility by installing adjustable-height workstations in 50% of the learning space by the end of Quarter 1."

#### Redesign Sketch
Create a simple visual representation that shows:
- Physical layout changes (furniture arrangement, accessibility features)
- New features or adaptations (technology, signage, learning stations)
- Color-coding for different inclusive elements
- Labels for key components

**Pro Tip**: You can use simple drawing tools like Google Drawings, Microsoft Paint, or even hand-draw and photograph your sketch.

#### Resource List
Compile a concise list of:
- Required materials with estimated costs
- Human resources needed (staff, volunteers, consultants)
- Training requirements (workshops, certifications)
- Support services to be utilized (tech support, accessibility experts)

**Example Format**:
* Materials: Adjustable desks (10) - $2,500
* Personnel: Diversity consultant - 5 hours @ $100/hr
* Training: Staff workshop on UDL principles - $350

#### Timeline
Develop a realistic implementation schedule with:
- Preparation phase activities (planning, ordering materials)
- Implementation milestones (installation dates, training sessions)
- Evaluation checkpoints (feedback collection points)
- Completion target date

**Example Timeline Entry**: "Weeks 3-4: Install new signage with multiple languages and visual cues"

### Step 3: Finalizing Your Proposal

1. Organize all components on a single page with clear headings
2. Use bullet points for clarity and brevity
3. Ensure your design is visually appealing and easy to follow
4. Proofread for clarity and professionalism

### Step 4: Exporting to PDF

1. Save your document in your word processor
2. Select "Export" or "Save As" from the file menu
3. Choose PDF as the file format
4. Name your file "Inclusion_Redesign_Proposal_YourName"
5. Select "Save" or "Export"
