# Building Inclusive Spaces

## Video Script: Touring Inclusive Classroom Environments

### INTRODUCTION

**[Opening shot of presenter standing outside a school building]**

PRESENTER: "Welcome to our exploration of inclusive classroom spaces! Today, we'll tour several exemplary classrooms that demonstrate how thoughtful design can create learning environments where every student feels valued, represented, and able to participate fully. These spaces incorporate universal design principles that benefit all learners while removing barriers for students with diverse needs."

### CLASSROOM TOUR #1: FLEXIBLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

**[Presenter enters first classroom]**

PRESENTER: "Our first stop showcases flexible seating arrangements. Notice how this classroom offers multiple seating options: traditional desks, standing tables, wobble stools, floor cushions, and a quiet corner with bean bags. This variety accommodates different physical needs, learning preferences, and sensory requirements."

**[Camera pans to show various seating arrangements]**

PRESENTER: "The furniture is arranged to create distinct zones: collaborative areas for group work, individual workspaces for focused tasks, and a central gathering space for whole-class activities. All furniture is easily movable, allowing quick reconfiguration based on learning activities."

### CLASSROOM TOUR #2: SENSORY-CONSIDERATE DESIGN

**[Transition to second classroom]**

PRESENTER: "In this classroom, notice the thoughtful lighting design. Natural light is abundant, but can be moderated with adjustable blinds. Overhead fluorescent lights have been supplemented with softer lamp options and light filters to reduce glare and flickering that can cause discomfort for some students."

**[Camera shows acoustic panels, sound-dampening materials]**

PRESENTER: "Sound management is equally important. Acoustic panels reduce echo, tennis balls on chair legs minimize scraping noises, and these noise-cancelling headphones are available for students who need auditory breaks."

### CLASSROOM TOUR #3: REPRESENTATION & ACCESSIBILITY

**[Transition to third classroom]**

PRESENTER: "This classroom excels at representation through its visual displays. Notice how the walls feature diverse images showing people of various ethnicities, abilities, family structures, and cultural backgrounds. Materials are presented at different heights to accommodate all students."

**[Camera pans to show multilingual labels and communication boards]**

PRESENTER: "Language displays include multilingual labels for common objects, visual schedules, and communication boards to support English language learners and students with communication differences. Digital technology provides text-to-speech options and materials in multiple formats."

### KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

**[Presenter stands in front of whiteboard with list]**

PRESENTER: "Let's summarize the key design principles we've observed:

1. **Flexibility**: Providing multiple ways to engage with the space and learning materials
2. **Sensory Consideration**: Managing light, sound, and visual stimulation
3. **Physical Accessibility**: Ensuring all areas and materials can be accessed by everyone
4. **Representation**: Including diverse imagery and materials that reflect all students
5. **Clear Organization**: Using consistent, intuitive systems for materials and routines
6. **Choice**: Offering options that accommodate different needs and preferences
7. **Balance**: Creating both stimulating and calming spaces within the classroom"

### CONCLUSION

**[Presenter in final classroom with students engaged in different activities]**

PRESENTER: "Creating inclusive spaces isn't about special accommodations for some studentsâ€”it's about thoughtful design that benefits everyone. When we remove barriers to participation, we enable all students to focus on learning rather than navigating challenges in their environment."

PRESENTER: "For Excel High School students, these principles apply whether you're setting up a home study space, participating in online discussions, or creating digital projects. Consider how you can apply universal design to your own learning environment to maximize your success."

PRESENTER: "Remember that even small changes can make a significant difference in creating a community where everyone belongs. In your next assignment, you'll have the opportunity to analyze your own learning space and suggest improvements based on these principles."
