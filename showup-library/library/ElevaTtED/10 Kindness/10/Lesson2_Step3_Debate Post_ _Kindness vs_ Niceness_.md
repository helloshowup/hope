# Debate Post: “Kindness vs. Niceness”

# Debate Post: "Kindness vs. Niceness"

## Assignment Overview

For this assignment, you will create a blog post exploring the important distinction between "kindness" and "niceness." While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent different approaches to human interaction with distinct motivations and outcomes.

## Blog Post Requirements

Your blog post must:
- Define both kindness and niceness clearly
- Present a thoughtful argument about their differences
- Provide at least one concrete example illustrating this difference
- Include at least 2 paragraphs (minimum)
- Cite at least one credible source

## The Assignment Prompt

**Kindness vs. Niceness: What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter?**

In your blog post, begin by defining both terms carefully. Consider questions like:
- What motivates kindness versus niceness?
- How do these qualities manifest differently in behavior?
- Which quality tends to have a deeper impact on others and why?

Develop a clear argument about the meaningful differences between these concepts. Your position should be supported with logical reasoning and at least one specific example that illustrates the distinction. For instance, you might describe a scenario where someone acts nicely but not kindly, or vice versa.

## Citation Requirements

You must incorporate at least one credible source to strengthen your argument. This could be:
- A scholarly article about psychology or social dynamics
- A well-researched book on human relationships
- A reputable website focused on emotional intelligence or character development

When citing your source, use proper MLA or APA format. Include both in-text citations and a works cited/references section at the end of your post. 

**Examples of proper citation:**

MLA format: According to Smith, "Kindness stems from genuine empathy while niceness often serves social expectations" (42).

APA format: Research suggests that kindness involves deeper emotional investment than niceness (Johnson, 2019).

## Peer Comment Requirements

After posting your blog, you will be expected to comment thoughtfully on at least two of your peers' posts. Your comments should:
- Be at least 3-4 sentences in length
- Engage specifically with your peer's argument
- Add value through additional insights, respectful questions, or connections to your own post
- Demonstrate critical thinking rather than simply agreeing or disagreeing

## Evaluation Criteria

Your blog post will be evaluated based on:
1. Clarity of definitions and distinctions between kindness and niceness
2. Strength and originality of your argument
3. Effectiveness of your example(s)
4. Proper integration and citation of your source(s)
5. Overall writing quality and organization
6. Depth of analysis regarding the personal and social impacts of kindness

## Tips for Success

- **Start early**: Give yourself time to research and refine your ideas
- **Use the Writing Lab**: Get feedback on your draft before submission
- **Be specific**: Concrete examples make abstract concepts clearer
- **Consider both sides**: Acknowledge potential counterarguments to strengthen your position
- **Proofread carefully**: Check for grammar, spelling, and citation format errors

Remember that this assignment asks you to think critically about character qualities that affect both personal relationships and broader society. The distinction between surface-level pleasantness and genuine compassion has significant implications for how we interact with others and build community.

Your completed blog post should demonstrate thoughtful reflection on how kindness, as opposed to mere niceness, shapes both individual experiences and social dynamics.
