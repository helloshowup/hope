This portfolio will showcase your understanding and application of kindness principles through real-world actions and reflections.\n\n## Selecting Your First Evidence Items\n\nFor this first submission, you'll need to select **two completed artifacts** from activities you've already finished. These could include:\n\n- Photos of kindness actions you've performed\n- Journal entries reflecting on an empathetic conversation\n- Screenshots of positive online interactions\n- Thank you notes you've written or received\n- Documentation of a community service project\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n### 1. Select Your Artifacts\nChoose two different artifacts that demonstrate your engagement with kindness and empathy concepts. Select items that you're proud of and that clearly show your learning progress.\n\n### 2. Add Meaningful Captions\nFor each artifact, create a detailed caption (100-150 words) that explains:\n- What the artifact represents\n- When and where it was created\n- How it connects to specific learning outcomes from our course\n- What you learned from this experience\n\n### 3. Check File Requirements\nBefore submitting:\n- Use appropriate file formats (.jpg, .png, .pdf, or .docx)\n- Ensure images are clear and text is legible\n- Remove any personal information you don't want to share\n- Test that any included links work properly\n\n### 4. Submit Your Evidence\nUpload your two artifacts with their captions as a single document to the submission portal in your Excel High School course dashboard. If you need technical assistance, contact your Success Coach through the Student Portal.\n\n## Connecting to Learning Outcomes\n\nWhen writing your captions, explicitly connect your artifacts to our course learning outcomes. For example:\n- \"This artifact demonstrates my growth in recognizing opportunities for kindness in everyday situations...\"\n- \"Through this experience, I developed my ability to show empathy by...\"\n\n## Grading Criteria\nYour submission will be evaluated based on:\n- Relevance to course concepts (40%)\n- Depth of reflection (30%)\n- Clarity of presentation (20%)\n- Following submission guidelines (10%)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter submitting your first evidence items, you'll receive feedback within 3-5 business days to guide your continued portfolio development. This feedback will help you improve future submissions.\n\nRemember, quality is more important than quantity. Choose artifacts that truly represent your learning and growth in applying kindness and empathy in real-world contexts.\n\n**Need help?** Use the BRYTE AI Tutor for immediate assistance or schedule time with your Success Coach through the Student Portal.",
