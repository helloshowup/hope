Your consistent efforts to understand others' perspectives will strengthen your relationships and help create a more supportive community both online and offline.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\nComplete your journal entries throughout the week, then submit your completed journal by [due date]. Your responses will be evaluated based on thoughtfulness, specific observations, and your growth in empathy skills\u2014not on the particular situations you choose to describe.",
