For our Kindness & Empathy project, your portfolio will serve as a digital record of your actions, reflections, and growth in practicing kindness and empathy toward others. Think of it as a personal kindness journal that captures your journey and showcases the positive impact you've made in your community.\n\nUnlike a simple assignment, your portfolio tells a story about your development and provides evidence of your commitment to becoming a more compassionate person. It allows you to document meaningful experiences and reflect on what you've learned along the way.\n\n## Portfolio Requirements\n\nYour Kindness & Empathy Portfolio must include the following components:\n\n1. **Cover Page**: \n   - Your name and class information\n   - A personal statement about what kindness means to you (150-200 words)\n   - Optional: A relevant image or quote that represents kindness to you\n\n2. **Action Log**: \n   - Documentation of at least 5 acts of kindness you've performed\n   - Include dates, brief descriptions, and who was involved\n   - Use the provided template in your Student Portal\n\n3. **Reflection Entries**: For each act of kindness, write a 250-300 word reflection discussing:\n   - What you did and why you chose this action\n   - How it affected others (observed reactions or feedback)\n   - How it made you feel before, during, and after\n   - What you learned about yourself and others\n   - How this experience might influence your future actions\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence**: \n   - Include at least one form of documentation for each act\n   - Examples: photos, screenshots, thank-you notes, brief testimonials\n   - Note: Always get permission before photographing others\n\n5. **Feedback Collection**: \n   - Gather brief comments from recipients or witnesses of your kind acts\n   - Can be written notes, audio recordings, or direct quotes\n   - If feedback isn't possible for a particular act, explain why\n\n6. **Final Reflection**: \n   - A 500-word summary of your overall experience and growth\n   - Discuss patterns you noticed, challenges you faced, and how this project changed your perspective\n   - Set 2-3 specific goals for continuing to practice kindness\n\n## File Formats & Submission Guidelines\n\nTo ensure your portfolio is easily accessible:\n\n- **Text Documents**: .docx, .pdf, or Google Docs\n- **Images**: .jpg, .png (compressed to under 1MB each)\n- **Videos**: .mp4 (no longer than 2 minutes each, compressed)\n- **Audio**: .mp3 (for recorded reflections or testimonials)\n\n**Submission Options:**\n1. Compile all components into a single PDF document\n2. Create a digital folder with clearly labeled files\n3. Use the Portfolio Builder tool in your Student Portal\n\n**Due Date:** Your completed portfolio is due by [specific date]. Two progress check-ins will be scheduled during the term.\n\n## Organization Tips\n\nUse these strategies to create a well-organized portfolio:\n\n### Tagging System\nTag your entries throughout your portfolio to track patterns:\n- **#ActType**: Categorize your actions (e.g., #Helping, #Listening, #Sharing)\n- **#Location**: Where the act took place (e.g., #School, #Home, #Community)\n- **#Emotion**: How you felt (e.g., #Grateful, #Inspired, #Challenged)\n- **#Impact**: The effect of your action (e.g., #SmallChange, #RippleEffect)\n- **#Growth**: Skills you developed (e.g., #Patience, #Understanding)\n\n### Time Management\n- Set aside 15-20 minutes after each act of kindness to document and reflect\n- Use the mobile app to capture quick notes or photos on the go\n- Schedule weekly portfolio work sessions to stay on track\n\n## Examples & Resources\n\n**Example Portfolio Components:**\n- [Link to sample cover page in Student Portal]\n- [Link to action log template in Student Portal]\n- [Link to reflection entry example in Student Portal]\n\n**Support Resources:**\n- Video tutorial: \"Creating Your Digital Portfolio\" (5 min)\n- Writing Lab: Schedule a 15-minute session for feedback on your reflections\n- Discussion Forum: Share ideas with classmates (optional)\n- AI Tutor: Get real-time help with portfolio organization\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **This week:** Create your portfolio structure and brainstorm potential acts of kindness\n2. **Next week:** Complete your first act and reflection\n3. **Throughout the term:** Continue adding entries and gathering evidence\n4. **Final two weeks:** Compile everything and write your final reflection\n\nRemember that your portfolio should demonstrate genuine effort and personal growth rather than simply completing a checklist. The most meaningful portfolios come from consistent attention and authentic engagement with the practice of kindness.\n\nNeed help?
