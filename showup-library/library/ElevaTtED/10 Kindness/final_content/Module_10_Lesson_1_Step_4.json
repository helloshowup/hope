By collecting images and words that illustrate acts of kindness you've observed or experienced, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how kindness and empathy appear in everyday life.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Identify examples of kindness in your daily environment\n- Analyze the relationship between kindness and empathy\n- Create a visual representation that communicates your understanding\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Kindness Snapshot Template (available in the Resources section below)\n- Digital images or words representing kindness\n- Computer or tablet with basic editing capabilities\n- Alternative option: Paper, magazines, and glue for those who prefer a physical collage\n\n## Time Required\n- Approximately 45-60 minutes to complete\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Access the Template\nDownload the Kindness Snapshot Template from the Resources section below. This template provides a drag-and-drop grid where you can easily arrange your images and text.\n\n**Alternative Option:** If you prefer to create a physical collage or have limited digital access, you may print the template and create your collage using paper, magazines, and glue.\n\n### Step 2: Collect Your Kindness Examples\nGather 5 different examples that represent kindness in your local context:\n- Take photos of kind acts you witness\n- Find images that represent kindness to you\n- Create text boxes with powerful words or quotes about kindness\n- Include symbols that represent kindness in your culture or community\n\n**Important:** Focus on examples from your own experience or community.
