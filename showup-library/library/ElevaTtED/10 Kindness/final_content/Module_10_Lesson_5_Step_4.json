Organize all components on a single page with clear headings\n2. Use bullet points for clarity and brevity\n3. Ensure your design is visually appealing and easy to follow\n4. Proofread for clarity and professionalism\n\n### Step 4: Exporting to PDF\n\n1. Save your document in your word processor\n2. Select \"Export\" or \"Save As\" from the file menu\n3.
