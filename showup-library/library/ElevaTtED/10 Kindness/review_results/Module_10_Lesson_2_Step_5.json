  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational value:\n\n1. Added a clear \"Purpose\" section to help students understand why they're completing this checklist\n2. Enhanced the upload instructions with numbered steps and clarified that both documents should be submitted\n3. Added descriptive details to the checklist items (e.g., specifying types of visual representations)\n4. Added a brief introduction to the self-reflection questions to explain their purpose\n5. Created a new \"Success Tips\" section that provides practical guidance for completing the assignment successfully\n6. Improved formatting with clearer section headers and more consistent structure\n7. Added specific reference to course material (\"Ripple Effects of Kindness\" lesson) to connect this assessment to previous learning\n\nThese changes make the checklist more instructionally complete, provide better scaffolding for all learner segments (especially \"Second-Chance Learners\" who need clear structure), and align with the UDL principles mentioned in the learner profile."
