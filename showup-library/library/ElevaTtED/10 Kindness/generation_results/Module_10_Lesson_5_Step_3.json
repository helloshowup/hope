    "<educational_content>\n# Forum Audit of Your Space\n\n## Activity Overview\nIn this activity, you will examine your learning space through the lens of inclusivity and design. This exercise helps us understand how our physical environments impact learning experiences.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Document Your Space\n* Take a photograph of your current learning space OR create a simple sketch of it\n* Post this image to our class forum\n* In your post, include:\n  1. Two strengths of your space that promote inclusivity and positive learning\n  2. One aspect of your space you could improve to make it more inclusive or conducive to learning\n  3. A brief explanation of why you identified these particular elements\n\n### Part 2: Peer Feedback\n* Review your classmates' posts\n* Comment thoughtfully on at least two of your peers' learning spaces\n* For each comment, provide:\n  1. A specific suggestion for enhancing the inclusive aspects they've already identified\n  2. A constructive idea for addressing their identified area for improvement\n\n### Example Post\n\"In my learning space (see attached image), two inclusive strengths are: (1) natural lighting that reduces eye strain and improves focus, and (2) an organized desk that accommodates my materials without clutter. One improvement I could make is adding a more supportive chair, as my current seating causes discomfort during longer study sessions.\"\n\n## Why This Matters\nUnderstanding how our physical environments affect learning helps us create spaces that support our educational goals. By examining each other's spaces, we build community while gathering practical ideas for improvement.\n\nRemember to be respectful and constructive in your feedback to classmates!\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Forum: Audit of Your Learning Space\n\n## Overview\nIn this activity, you'll analyze your personal learning environment through the lens of inclusivity and design. This exercise helps you apply what you've learned about creating positive, inclusive learning spaces to your own study environment.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Document Your Space\n* Take a photograph of your current learning space OR create a simple sketch of it\n* Post this image to the forum\n\n### Part 2: Analyze Your Space\nIn your post, include the following analysis:\n* Identify **two strengths** of your space that support inclusive learning (Examples: good lighting, ergonomic seating, minimal distractions, organized materials, etc.)\n* Identify **one area for improvement** that would make your space more conducive to inclusive learning\n\n### Part 3: Peer Feedback\n* Review your classmates' posts\n* Comment on at least **two** of your peers' learning spaces\n* For each peer, offer specific, constructive suggestions for enhancing their learning environment\n\n## Example Post\n\"Here's a photo of my study corner. **Strengths**: (1) Natural lighting from the window reduces eye strain and improves focus; (2) My organized desk with labeled supplies helps me maintain structure and reduces anxiety when working. **Area for improvement**: I need to reduce visual distractions on my wall that can pull my attention away during study sessions.\"\n\n## Grading Criteria\n* Complete submission with image and required analysis\n* Thoughtful identification of inclusive design elements\n* Constructive peer feedback that offers specific suggestions\n* Respectful and supportive tone in all communications\n\nRemember, the goal is to create learning environments that work for everyone!\n</educational_content>",
