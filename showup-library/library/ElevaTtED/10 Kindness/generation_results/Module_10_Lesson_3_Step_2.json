This tool will help you intentionally incorporate acts of kindness into your daily routine. By planning your kindness activities, you'll be more likely to follow through and create positive habits that benefit both yourself and others.\n\n## Setting Up Your Kindness Planner\n\nYour Kindness Planner can be either digital (using a notes app, calendar, or planner app) or printed (using a notebook or printed template).
