While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent distinct concepts with different impacts on our relationships and communities.\n\n## Blog Post Requirements\n\nYour blog post must:\n- Define both \"kindness\" and \"niceness\" clearly\n- Present a well-reasoned argument about the differences between these concepts\n- Provide at least one concrete example that illustrates these differences\n- Include at least one properly cited source to support your points\n- Be a minimum of 2 paragraphs in length (though more thorough exploration is encouraged)\n\n## Prompt\n\n**Kindness vs. Niceness: What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter?**\n\nIn your blog post, begin by defining both kindness and niceness as you understand them. Consider questions like:\n- What motivates acts of kindness versus acts of niceness?\n- How do these qualities manifest differently in relationships?\n- Which quality tends to have a deeper impact, and why?\n- Can someone be kind without being nice, or nice without being kind?\n\nDevelop a clear position on how these concepts differ and why understanding this difference matters in our personal and social lives. Support your position with specific examples from your own experience or observations.\n\n## Source Citation Requirements\n\nYou must incorporate and properly cite at least one credible source in your blog post. This could be:\n- A scholarly article about psychology or social behavior\n- A book on ethics, relationships, or character development\n- A reputable website focused on personal development or social psychology\n\nWhen citing your source, use MLA format. For example:\n- In-text citation: (Author's Last Name Page Number)\n- Works Cited entry: Author's Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Article.\" Title of Website, Publisher, Date of Publication, URL.\n\n## Peer Comment Requirements\n\nAfter posting your blog, you will be expected to comment thoughtfully on at least two of your peers' posts. Your comments should:\n- Be at least 3-4 sentences in length\n- Engage specifically with your peer's arguments or examples\n- Add to the conversation by offering additional insights or respectful counterpoints\n- Avoid simple agreement statements like \"Great post!\" without substantive content\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nYour blog post will be evaluated based on:\n1. Clarity of definitions and distinctions between kindness and niceness\n2. Depth of analysis and critical thinking about the social impact of these qualities\n3. Effectiveness of examples in illustrating your points\n4. Proper integration and citation of at least one source\n5. Overall writing quality and organization\n6. Thoughtfulness of your comments on peers' posts\n\n## Submission Timeline\n\n- Initial blog post due: [Insert due date]\n- Peer comments due: [Insert due date - typically 2-3 days after initial post]\n\nRemember, the goal of this assignment is to develop your critical thinking about character qualities that significantly impact our social interactions and community well-being. Your thoughtful exploration of these concepts contributes to our collective understanding of what makes meaningful human connections.\n</educational_content>",

Consider questions like:\n- What motivates kindness versus niceness?\n- How do these qualities manifest differently in behavior?\n- Which quality tends to have a deeper impact on others and why?\n\nDevelop a clear argument about the meaningful differences between these concepts. Your position should be supported with logical reasoning and at least one specific example that illustrates the distinction. For instance, you might describe a scenario where someone acts nicely but not kindly, or vice versa.\n\n## Citation Requirements\n\nYou must incorporate at least one credible source to strengthen your argument. This could be:\n- A scholarly article about psychology or social dynamics\n- A well-researched book on human relationships\n- A reputable website focused on emotional intelligence or character development\n\nWhen citing your source, use proper MLA or APA format. Include both in-text citations and a works cited/references section at the end of your post. For example:\n\nMLA format: According to Smith, \"Kindness stems from genuine empathy while niceness often serves social expectations\" (42).\n\nAPA format: Research suggests that kindness involves deeper emotional investment than niceness (Johnson, 2019).\n\n## Peer Comment Requirements\n\nAfter posting your blog, you will be expected to comment thoughtfully on at least two of your peers' posts. Your comments should:\n- Be at least 3-4 sentences in length\n- Engage specifically with your peer's argument\n- Add value through additional insights, respectful questions, or connections to your own post\n- Demonstrate critical thinking rather than simply agreeing or disagreeing\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nYour blog post will be evaluated based on:\n1. Clarity of definitions and distinctions between kindness and niceness\n2. Strength and originality of your argument\n3. Effectiveness of your example(s)\n4. Proper integration and citation of your source(s)\n5. Overall writing quality and organization\n6. Depth of analysis regarding the personal and social impacts of kindness\n\nRemember that this assignment asks you to think critically about character qualities that affect both personal relationships and broader society. The distinction between surface-level pleasantness and genuine compassion has significant implications for how we interact with others and build community.\n\nYour completed blog post should demonstrate thoughtful reflection on how kindness, as opposed to mere niceness, shapes both individual experiences and social dynamics.\n</educational_content>",
