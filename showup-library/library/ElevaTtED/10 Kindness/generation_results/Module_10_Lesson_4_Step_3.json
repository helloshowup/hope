Empathy helps us understand conflicts better and build stronger relationships with our peers.\n\n## Assignment Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Your Reflection (150-word minimum)\nThink about a recent conflict or disagreement you had with someone. This could be with a friend, family member, classmate, or teammate. Write a reflection that:\n\n1. Retells the conflict entirely from the OTHER person's perspective\n2. Includes what they might have been feeling during the conflict\n3. Describes what needs they were trying to meet\n4. Suggests a resolution that would have satisfied both parties\n\nRemember to write in first person AS IF YOU WERE THE OTHER PERSON. For example: \"I felt frustrated when...\"\n\n### Part 2: Peer Response\nAfter posting your reflection, read through your classmates' posts and respond thoughtfully to at least one. In your response:\n- Comment on their ability to see the situation from another perspective\n- Share any additional insights about the conflict they described\n- Offer supportive feedback on their suggested resolution\n\n## Example Starter\n\n\"From their perspective, I probably felt ignored when I was trying to explain my idea for our group project. I needed to feel heard and valued as a team member. When my suggestion was quickly dismissed, I might have felt that my contributions weren't important...\"\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n- Post your reflection (minimum 150 words) to the discussion board\n- Respond to at least one classmate's post with thoughtful feedback\n- Remember to be respectful and constructive in all communications\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Role-Switch Reflection Assignment\n\n## Objective\nPractice empathy by viewing a conflict from another person's perspective, helping you understand different viewpoints and strengthen our classroom community.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Your Reflection (150-word minimum)\nThink about a recent conflict or disagreement you've experienced with someone else. This could be with a friend, family member, classmate, or teammate. For this assignment, you will:\n\n1. Retell this conflict entirely from the **other person's perspective**\n2. Include what you think they were **feeling** during the conflict\n3. Describe what **needs** they had that weren't being met\n4. Suggest a **resolution** that would have better addressed both parties' concerns\n\nWrite your reflection in first person, as if you ARE the other person. For example: \"I felt frustrated when [your name] didn't listen to my idea because...\"\n\n### Part 2: Peer Response\nAfter posting your reflection, read through your classmates' posts and respond thoughtfully to at least one. In your response, comment on:\n- What insights they gained by switching perspectives\n- How their reflection demonstrates empathy\n- Any additional thoughts on their suggested resolution\n\n## Grading Criteria\n- Thoroughness in addressing all required elements\n- Demonstration of genuine effort to understand another perspective\n- Thoughtfulness of peer response\n- Meeting minimum word count (150 words)\n\nRemember, the goal is to practice seeing situations through others' eyes, not to determine who was \"right\" or \"wrong\" in the conflict.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Role-Switch Reflection\n\n## Introduction\nIn this activity, you'll practice empathy by retelling a recent conflict from the other person's perspective. This exercise helps develop understanding and compassion for others' viewpoints, even when they differ from our own.\n\n## Assignment Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Your Reflection (150-word minimum)\nWrite about a recent conflict or disagreement you experienced with someone. Instead of telling the story from your perspective, switch roles and write it from the other person's point of view. Include:\n\n- What they might have been thinking and feeling\n- Their needs or concerns that weren't being met\n- What resolution they might have preferred\n- What they might have learned from the interaction\n\nRemember to be fair and generous in your portrayal. The goal isn't to create a \"villain\" but to genuinely try to understand their perspective.\n\n### Part 2: Peer Response\nAfter posting your reflection, read and respond thoughtfully to at least one classmate's post. In your response:\n- Note what insights you gained from their perspective-switching\n- Share how their reflection might help you in future conflicts\n- Offer supportive and constructive feedback\n\n## Why This Matters\nPracticing empathy helps us build stronger relationships, resolve conflicts more effectively, and create a more supportive community. This skill extends beyond the classroom into all aspects of life.\n\n## Submission\nPost your reflection and peer response in the discussion forum by the due date.\n</educational_content>"
