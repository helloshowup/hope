For our Kindness & Empathy project, your portfolio will serve as a digital record of your actions, reflections, and growth in practicing kindness and empathy toward others. Think of it as a personal kindness journal that captures your journey and showcases the positive impact you've made in your community.\n\nUnlike a simple assignment, your portfolio tells a story about your development and provides evidence of your commitment to becoming a more compassionate person. It allows you to document meaningful experiences and reflect on what you've learned along the way.\n\n## Required Artifacts List\n\nYour Kindness & Empathy Portfolio must include the following items:\n\n1. **Cover Page**: Your name, class information, and a personal statement about kindness\n2. **Action Log**: Documentation of at least 5 acts of kindness you've performed\n3. **Reflection Entries**: Written reflections (one per act) discussing:\n   - What you did\n   - Why you chose this action\n   - How it affected others\n   - How it made you feel\n   - What you learned\n4. **Supporting Evidence**: Photos, thank-you notes, or other documentation\n5. **Feedback Collection**: Comments from recipients or witnesses of your kind acts\n6. **Final Reflection**: A summary of your overall experience and growth\n\n## Suggested File Formats\n\nTo ensure your portfolio is easily accessible and shareable, please use these file formats:\n\n- **Text Documents**: .docx, .pdf, or Google Docs\n- **Images**: .jpg, .png (compressed to reasonable file sizes)\n- **Videos**: .mp4 (no longer than 2 minutes each, compressed)\n- **Audio**: .mp3 (for recorded reflections or testimonials)\n- **Presentations**: .pptx or Google Slides\n\nAll components should be compiled into a single PDF document or digital folder for final submission.\n\n## Tagging Strategy\n\nOrganizing your portfolio with a consistent tagging system will help you track your progress and make connections between different experiences. Use these tags throughout your portfolio:\n\n- **#ActType**: Categorize your actions (e.g., #Helping, #Listening, #Sharing, #Supporting)\n- **#Location**: Where the act took place (e.g., #School, #Home, #Community)\n- **#Emotion**: How you felt (e.g., #Grateful, #Inspired, #Challenged)\n- **#Impact**: The effect of your action (e.g., #SmallChange, #RippleEffect)\n- **#Growth**: Skills or qualities you developed (e.g., #Patience, #Understanding)\n\nInclude these tags in your reflection entries to help identify patterns in your kindness journey.\n\n## Example Screenshots\n\n![Portfolio Cover Page Example](https://exampleimage.com/portfolio-cover.jpg)\n*Example of a well-designed cover page with personal statement*\n\n![Action Log Example](https://exampleimage.com/action-log.jpg)\n*Sample action log showing date, action, recipient, and tags*\n\n![Reflection Entry Example](https://exampleimage.com/reflection.jpg)\n*Example of a thoughtful reflection with proper tagging*\n\n![Evidence Example](https://exampleimage.com/evidence.jpg)\n*Example of supporting evidence with a photo and brief description*\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin by creating a digital folder to collect your artifacts. As you perform acts of kindness, document them promptly while the experience is fresh in your mind. Remember that your portfolio should demonstrate genuine effort and personal growth rather than simply completing a checklist of tasks.\n\nYour portfolio is due at the end of the term, but regular check-ins will help ensure you're making steady progress. The most meaningful portfolios come from consistent attention and authentic engagement with the practice of kindness.",
