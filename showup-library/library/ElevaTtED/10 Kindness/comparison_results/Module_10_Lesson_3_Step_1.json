Your ideas made our presentation so much better!\"\n\n**[On-screen text: \"COMPLIMENT STEPS:\n1. Be specific and sincere\n2. Focus on actions or qualities, not just appearance\n3. Deliver with eye contact and a smile\"]**\n\n### Act #2: Help with a Task\n\n**[Presenter notices someone carrying books/materials]**\n\nPRESENTER: Our second act is helping someone with a task without being asked.\n\n**[Presenter demonstrates]**: \"Those look heavy! Can I help you carry some of those to your classroom?\"\n\n**[On-screen text: \"HELPING STEPS:\n1. Notice when someone might need assistance\n2.

That makes sense. Tell me more about how it went.\"\n\n**[On-screen text: \"ACTIVE LISTENING TECHNIQUES:\n1. Put away distractions (especially phones)\n2.

Ask follow-up questions instead of changing the subject\"]**\n\n### Challenge Invitation\n\n**[Presenter back to camera]**\n\nPRESENTER: Now it's your turn! I challenge you to try at least one of these acts of kindness each day this week. Notice how it makes you feel and how others respond. Remember, kindness creates ripples that extend far beyond the initial act.\n\nStart small, be consistent, and watch how these simple actions can transform your relationships and community. Next week, we'll share our experiences and the impact of our kindness challenge!\n\n**[Final on-screen text: \"KINDNESS CHALLENGE: Try one act each day this week!\"]**\n\n**[End of video]**",
