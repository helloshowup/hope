When we communicate with compassion and respect, we create positive connections with others. This activity will help you practice rewriting your own messages to make them more compassionate and effective.\n\n## Learning Objective\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to identify elements of compassionate communication and apply them to improve your own messages.\n\n## Guidelines for Compassionate Communication\nWhen rewriting your message, consider these guidelines:\n- **Use \"I\" statements** instead of accusatory \"you\" statements\n- **Express your feelings** clearly but respectfully\n- **State observations** rather than judgments\n- **Make specific requests** instead of demands\n- **Show empathy** for the other person's perspective\n- **Focus on the issue**, not personal attacks\n- **Offer solutions** when appropriate\n\n## Activity Instructions\n1. Select a past message (email, text, social media post) that you sent when you were upset, frustrated, or angry.\n2. Anonymize any names or identifying information in the message.\n3. Post your original message.\n4. Rewrite the message using the compassionate communication guidelines.\n5. Post your revised version.\n\n## Example\n\n**Original Message:**\n\"You never respond to my texts on time. You're so inconsiderate. I'm tired of always waiting around for you. Don't bother texting me back now.\"\n\n**Revised Message:**\n\"I felt concerned when I didn't hear back from you earlier. When messages go unanswered for a while, I start to worry and feel a bit frustrated. In the future, I'd appreciate even a quick reply letting me know you're busy. How does that sound?\"\n\n## Reflection Questions\nAfter completing your rewrite, consider:\n- How might the recipient's response differ between the original and revised messages?\n- What emotions were you feeling when you wrote the original message?\n- How did reframing your words change the tone and potential impact?\n- Which version is more likely to lead to a productive conversation?\n\nRemember, compassionate communication isn't about hiding your feelings\u2014it's about expressing them in ways that promote understanding rather than defensiveness.",
