This portfolio will showcase your understanding and application of kindness principles through real-world actions and reflections.\n\n## Selecting Your First Evidence Items\n\nFor this first submission, you'll need to select **two completed artifacts** from activities you've already finished. These could include:\n\n- Photos of kindness actions you've performed\n- Journal entries reflecting on an empathetic conversation\n- Screenshots of positive online interactions\n- Thank you notes you've written or received\n- Documentation of a community service project\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n### 1. Select Your Artifacts\nChoose two different artifacts that demonstrate your engagement with kindness and empathy concepts. Select items that you're proud of and that clearly show your learning progress.\n\n### 2. Add Meaningful Captions\nFor each artifact, create a detailed caption that explains:\n- What the artifact represents\n- When and where it was created\n- How it connects to specific learning outcomes from our course\n- What you learned from this experience\n\n### 3. Check File Visibility\nBefore submitting:\n- Ensure all files are in appropriate formats (.jpg, .png, .pdf, or .docx)\n- Verify that images are clear and text is legible\n- Confirm that any personal information you don't want to share is removed\n- Test that links work if you're including any web-based content\n\n### 4. Submit Your Evidence\nCompile your two artifacts with their captions into a single document or folder. Submit the link to your evidence through the submission portal in the course dashboard.\n\n## Connecting to Learning Outcomes\n\nWhen writing your captions, explicitly connect your artifacts to our course learning outcomes. For example:\n- \"This artifact demonstrates my growth in recognizing opportunities for kindness in everyday situations...\"\n- \"Through this experience, I developed my ability to show empathy by...\"\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter submitting your first evidence items, you'll receive feedback to guide your continued portfolio development. This is just the beginning of documenting your kindness journey!\n\nRemember, quality is more important than quantity. Choose artifacts that truly represent your learning and growth.",
