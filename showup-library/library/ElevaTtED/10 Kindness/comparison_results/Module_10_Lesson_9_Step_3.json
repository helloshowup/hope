Creating meaningful change in your community begins with careful planning and clear goals. This instruction sheet will guide you through the process of selecting and scoping your kindness initiative.\n\n## Step 1: Choose Your Kindness Initiative\nBegin by brainstorming ideas for kindness initiatives that could positively impact your community. Consider:\n- What issues or needs exist in your community?\n- What kindness initiatives would address these needs?\n- What are you passionate about?\n\n**Activity:** Write down 3-5 possible kindness initiatives. For each idea, note why it matters to you and how it might benefit others. Then select the one that you feel most passionate about and believe will make the greatest positive impact.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Your Target Group\nDetermine who will benefit from your kindness initiative:\n- Who specifically needs this support or kindness?\n- How many people do you aim to reach?\n- How will you connect with this group?\n\n**Example:** If your initiative is a \"Kindness Cards for Seniors\" project, your target group might be \"30 residents at Sunny Valley Retirement Home who receive few visitors.\"\n\n## Step 3: Set a SMART Goal\nCreate a goal that is:\n- **Specific**: Clearly define what you will accomplish\n- **Measurable**: Include quantities or indicators of progress\n- **Achievable**: Be realistic about what you can accomplish\n- **Relevant**: Ensure it relates to promoting kindness\n- **Time-bound**: Set a specific timeframe\n\n**Example SMART Goal:** \"To create and deliver 50 handwritten kindness cards to seniors at Sunny Valley Retirement Home by December 15, bringing joy and connection to residents during the holiday season.\"\n\n## Step 4: List Needed Resources\nIdentify everything you'll need to make your initiative successful:\n- Materials and supplies\n- Helpers or volunteers\n- Space or locations\n- Permissions or approvals\n- Funding (if needed)\n\n## Step 5: Create a Timeline\nDevelop a realistic schedule that includes:\n- Planning phase (research, gathering resources)\n- Preparation phase (creating materials, recruiting help)\n- Implementation phase (the actual kindness activities)\n- Follow-up phase (thank yous, reflection, evaluation)\n\nBe sure to include specific dates for key milestones and completion.\n\n## Planning Worksheet\nUse the following format to document your initiative plan:\n\n1. **Selected Initiative**: [Your chosen kindness project]\n2. **Target Group**: [Who will benefit and how many]\n3. **SMART Goal**: [Your complete SMART goal]\n4. **Resources Needed**: [List all required resources]\n5. **Timeline**: [Key dates and milestones]\n\nRemember, a well-planned initiative has a much greater chance of success and creating meaningful impact in your community!",
