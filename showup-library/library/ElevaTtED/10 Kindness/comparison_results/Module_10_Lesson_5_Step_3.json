This exercise helps us understand how our physical environments impact learning experiences.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Part 1: Document Your Space\n* Take a photograph of your current learning space OR create a simple sketch of it\n* Post this image to our class forum\n* In your post, include:\n  1. Two strengths of your space that promote inclusivity and positive learning\n  2. One aspect of your space you could improve to make it more inclusive or conducive to learning\n  3. A brief explanation of why you identified these particular elements\n\n### Part 2: Peer Feedback\n* Review your classmates' posts\n* Comment thoughtfully on at least two of your peers' learning spaces\n* For each comment, provide:\n  1. A specific suggestion for enhancing the inclusive aspects they've already identified\n  2. A constructive idea for addressing their identified area for improvement\n\n### Example Post\n\"In my learning space (see attached image), two inclusive strengths are: (1) natural lighting that reduces eye strain and improves focus, and (2) an organized desk that accommodates my materials without clutter. One improvement I could make is adding a more supportive chair, as my current seating causes discomfort during longer study sessions.\"\n\n## Why This Matters\nUnderstanding how our physical environments affect learning helps us create spaces that support our educational goals. By examining each other's spaces, we build community while gathering practical ideas for improvement.\n\nRemember to be respectful and constructive in your feedback to classmates!",
