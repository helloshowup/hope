  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the Final Reflection Portfolio instructions:\n\n1. Added a \"Purpose and Value\" section at the beginning to help students understand why this assignment matters to their learning journey.\n\n2. Added a required \"Personal reflection statement\" to the checklist to ensure students provide an overall synthesis of their experience.\n\n3. Enhanced the evaluation criteria with more specific examples of what constitutes quality work.\n\n4. Customized the instructions to reference Excel High School's specific tools and systems (LearnStage LMS, Student Portal, Success Coach, Writing Lab, BRYTE AI Tutor).\n\n5. Added a \"Support Resources\" section to connect students with available help options, which is especially important for asynchronous learners who may need guidance.\n\nThese changes make the instructions more specific to Excel High School's learning environment, provide clearer guidance on expectations, and offer better support for the diverse learner segments described in the profile (particularly adult learners, credit recovery students, and \"second-chance\" learners who may benefit from additional structure and support)."
