Respond thoughtfully to **at least two** of your peers\n2. Include **one constructive question** in each response\n3. Keep responses supportive and solution-oriented\n\n## Example Reflection Post:\n\n```\n[Tracker screenshot]\n\nMy positive trend has been consistent morning workouts, which has improved my energy levels throughout the day. I've successfully maintained my 6 AM routine for 12 days this month.\n\nMy challenge remains proper hydration. Despite setting reminders, I'm averaging only 4 cups of water daily instead of my 8-cup goal.\n\nFor improvement, I'll place water bottles in strategic locations (desk, car, bedside) and use my fitness app's hydration tracker with hourly alerts. I'll also connect drinking water to existing habits by having a full cup after each meal and workout.\n\nWhat strategies have helped you overcome similar consistency challenges?\n```\n\n## Why This Matters:\nThis reflection process helps you:\n* Evaluate your progress objectively\n* Recognize your achievements \n* Develop targeted solutions for ongoing challenges\n* Gain new perspectives from peers\n* Build connections within our Excel High School learning community\n\n**Need Help?** If you're unsure about what to track or how to reflect on your progress, contact your Success Coach through the Student Portal or use the BRYTE AI Tutor for guidance.\n\nRemember to be specific, constructive, and concise in both your post and responses.",
  "edit_summary": "I made the following improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and inclusivity:\n\n1. Added code formatting around the example post to visually separate it from instructions\n2. Reformatted the \"Why This Matters\" section into bullet points for easier scanning\n3. Added a \"Need Help?\" section that references Excel High School's specific support resources (Success Coach and BRYTE AI Tutor)\n4. Explicitly mentioned \"Excel High School learning community\" to reinforce school identity\n5. Maintained all original content while improving visual organization and adding support information\n\nThese changes make the content more accessible for all learner segments, particularly \"Second-Chance Learners\" who may need additional support and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who benefit from clear structure while managing multiple responsibilities."
