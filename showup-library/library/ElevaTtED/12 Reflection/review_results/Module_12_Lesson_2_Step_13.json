Your document must include:\n   - At least 2-3 SMART goals that are:\n     * **S**pecific: Clearly defined what you want to accomplish\n     * **M**easurable: Include concrete criteria to measure progress\n     * **A**chievable: Realistic given your current situation\n     * **R**elevant: Connected to your educational journey\n     * **T**ime-bound: Include specific deadlines\n   - Direct connections between each goal and your reflection insights\n   - A realistic implementation timeline with checkpoints\n\n2. Upload your completed SMART Goals document using the submission button below.\n\n### Example Goal Format\n```\nGOAL: Improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of the semester.\nREFLECTION CONNECTION: My reflection showed math is my weakest subject.\nACTION STEPS: \n- Schedule 3 hours of math study time each week\n- Attend virtual tutoring sessions twice monthly\n- Complete all practice problems, not just required ones\nTIMELINE: Weekly study schedule starting immediately, with grade check at midterm (Oct 15)\n```\n\n## Assessment Criteria\nYour submission will be evaluated using the following rubric:\n\n| Criteria | Excellent (90-100%) | Satisfactory (70-89%) | Needs Improvement (<70%) |\n|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| SMART Format | All goals fully meet all 5 SMART criteria | Most goals meet most SMART criteria | Goals missing multiple SMART elements |\n| Reflection Connection | Clear, specific links between goals and reflection insights | Some connection to reflection insights | Weak or missing connection to reflections |\n| Implementation Plan | Detailed, realistic timeline with specific action steps | Basic timeline with some action steps | Vague or unrealistic implementation plan |\n\n**Note:** You must achieve a score of 70% or higher to unlock the next module.

  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational effectiveness:\n\n1. Restructured the content with clearer headings and visual organization\n2. Added detailed explanations of each SMART criteria component\n3. Included a concrete example of a properly formatted goal to model expectations\n4. Created a detailed rubric table to clearly show assessment criteria at different performance levels\n5. Added a \"Need Help?\" section with specific resources for struggling students\n6. Improved formatting with bullet points, indentation, and a code block for the example\n7. Expanded the implementation plan requirements to include specific action steps and checkpoints\n\nThese changes provide more structure, clearer expectations, and better scaffolding for all learner segments, particularly benefiting \"Second-Chance Learners\" and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who may need additional support with academic planning."
