Some people get it naturally, but I don't.\" *(Fixed mindset: This response assumes abilities are fixed and unchangeable.)*\n\nB) \"This is disappointing, but I'll review what I got wrong and ask for help to understand these concepts better.\" *(Growth mindset: This response sees the setback as an opportunity to learn and improve.)*\n\nC) \"The teacher made the quiz too hard. It's not fair to test us on this material.\" *(Fixed mindset: This response blames external factors rather than taking responsibility for learning.)*\n\nD) \"I need to try different study strategies next time. Maybe I'll form a study group or use flashcards.\" *(Growth mindset: This response focuses on developing new strategies to improve performance.)*\n\n**Correct answers: B and D** - These responses demonstrate a growth mindset by viewing challenges as opportunities to learn and develop new strategies.\n\n## Scenario 2: Group Project Conflict\nYour group project team is having disagreements about how to proceed.

What's your thought process?\n\nA) \"This is really challenging, but that means my brain is growing. I'll keep practicing until I improve.\" *(Growth mindset: This response embraces challenges as opportunities for growth.)*\n\nB) \"I should be able to figure this out quickly. If it takes me too long, maybe I'm not cut out for tech.\" *(Fixed mindset: This response assumes quick mastery is necessary and gives up too easily.)*\n\nC) \"I'll break this down into smaller steps and celebrate small victories along the way.\" *(Growth mindset: This response uses strategies to make progress and recognizes incremental improvement.)*\n\nD) \"Some people are just naturally good with technology.

What do you think?\n\nA) \"They're just smarter than me. Some people are born with more intelligence.\" *(Fixed mindset: This response assumes intelligence is fixed and unchangeable.)*\n\nB) \"I wonder what strategies they're using. Maybe I could learn from their approach.\" *(Growth mindset: This response sees others' success as inspiration and opportunity to learn.)*\n\nC) \"Everyone learns differently. I might need more time, but with effort I'll get there too.\" *(Growth mindset: This response recognizes that learning paths differ and values persistence.)*\n\nD) \"There's no point in trying as hard since I'll never be as good as they are.\" *(Fixed mindset: This response gives up based on comparisons rather than focusing on personal growth.)*\n\n**Correct answers: B and C** - These responses demonstrate a growth mindset by viewing others' success as inspiration rather than discouragement.",
