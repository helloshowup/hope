This digital tool will help you monitor your performance over time with visual indicators and charts.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Create a functional Google Sheet tracker\n- Apply conditional formatting to visualize progress\n- Generate a progress bar chart\n- Share your tracker with appropriate permissions\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### 1. Creating a Google Sheet\n\nFirst, let's create a new Google Sheet:\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)\n2. Click on the \"+\" icon or select \"Blank\" to create a new spreadsheet\n3. Click on \"Untitled spreadsheet\" at the top and rename it \"My Progress Tracker\"\n\n### 2. Entering Sample Data\n\nNow, let's set up our tracker with sample data:\n1. In cell A1, type \"Date\"\n2. In cell B1, type \"Activity\"\n3. In cell C1, type \"Score (%)\"\n4. In cells A2-A6, enter five consecutive dates (e.g., 5/1/2023, 5/2/2023, etc.)\n5. In cells B2-B6, enter sample activities (e.g., \"Running,\" \"Swimming,\" \"Cycling,\" etc.)\n6. In cells C2-C6, enter sample scores between 0-100 (e.g., 65, 70, 85, 78, 90)\n\n### 3. Applying Conditional Formatting\n\nLet's create visual indicators using colors:\n1. Select cells C2-C6 (your score column)\n2. Click on \"Format\" in the menu, then \"Conditional formatting\"\n3. In the sidebar that appears, set the following rules:\n   - Format cells if \"Greater than or equal to\" 80 \u2192 Fill color: green\n   - Click \"Add another rule\"\n   - Format cells if \"Greater than or equal to\" 60 \u2192 Fill color: yellow\n   - Click \"Add another rule\"\n   - Format cells if \"Less than\" 60 \u2192 Fill color: red\n4. Click \"Done\"\n\n### 4. Inserting a Progress Bar Chart\n\nLet's visualize your progress with a chart:\n1. Select cells A1-C6 (including headers and all data)\n2. Click \"Insert\" in the menu, then \"Chart\"\n3. In the Chart editor sidebar, select \"Column chart\" from the drop-down menu\n4. Adjust settings if needed (the X-axis should show dates, and the Y-axis should show scores)\n5. Click \"Customize\" tab to change colors or titles if desired\n6. Click the three dots in the corner of the chart and select \"Move to own sheet\"\n\n### 5. Sharing Your Tracker\n\nFinally, let's share your tracker:\n1. Click the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner\n2. Click \"Get link\"\n3. Under \"General access,\" click the dropdown and select \"Anyone with the link\" and \"Viewer\"\n4. Copy the link to share with others who need to view (but not edit) your progress\n\n## Your Turn\n\nNow pause this tutorial and replicate what you've learned:\n1. Create your own Google Sheet tracker\n2. Enter your personal activity data\n3. Apply the conditional formatting\n4. Create your progress chart\n5. Practice sharing with appropriate permissions\n\nOnce complete, you'll have a powerful visual tool to track your progress over time!",
