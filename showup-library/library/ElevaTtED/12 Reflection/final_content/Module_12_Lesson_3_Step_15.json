In this lesson, we'll analyze a real case study of a failed group project using the Gibbs Reflective Cycle and identify cognitive biases that may have influenced the outcome. This structured approach will help you develop critical thinking skills to evaluate your own experiences.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Apply the Gibbs Reflective Cycle to analyze academic setbacks\n- Identify common cognitive biases that affect decision-making\n- Develop strategies to overcome similar challenges in future projects\n\n## Case Study: The Deadline Disaster\n\n> **Group Project Timeline: School Fundraising Campaign**\n> \n> A team of five students was assigned to create a fundraising campaign for the school's athletic department. The project spanned four weeks and required research, planning, marketing materials, and a final presentation. Despite initial enthusiasm, the project failed to meet its deadline and received a poor grade.\n> \n> **Week 1:** Team met once, assigned roles, and created a basic outline. Two members missed the meeting.\n> \n> **Week 2:** Communication happened primarily through text messages. Research was delayed as team members waited for each other's contributions.\n> \n> **Week 3:** Team discovered their initial approach wouldn't work. Emergency meeting called, but only three members attended. Complete restart required.\n> \n> **Week 4:** Rushed completion with minimal coordination. Presentation contained contradictory information and incomplete sections. Final grade: D+\n\n## The Gibbs Reflective Cycle: A Six-Step Process\n\nThe Gibbs Reflective Cycle provides a structured framework for analyzing experiences. Let's apply each step to our case study:\n\n### 1. Description: What happened?\n\n> *\"Our group project completely fell apart in the final week. We had to scramble to put together a presentation that made little sense, and we received our first D+ ever. It was embarrassing presenting such incomplete work.\"*\n\n**Key Question:** What factual details can you recall about the situation?\n\n### 2. Feelings: What were you thinking and feeling?\n\n> *\"I felt frustrated that others weren't contributing equally. I was anxious as the deadline approached, and eventually resigned to the fact we would fail. I also felt guilty for not speaking up sooner about the problems.\"*\n\n**Key Question:** How did your emotions influence your actions or decisions?\n\n### 3. Evaluation: What was good and bad about the experience?\n\n> *\"The positive aspect was learning how NOT to manage a project. The negative was the poor grade and the tension it created between team members. We wasted time waiting for each other instead of being proactive.\"*\n\n**Key Question:** What worked well? What didn't work? Why?\n\n### 4. Analysis: What sense can you make of the situation?\n\n> *\"We failed to establish clear communication channels and deadlines for individual contributions. We also avoided confronting problems until it was too late to fix them. No one took leadership when the original plan failed.\"*\n\n**Key Question:** What factors or patterns contributed to the outcome?\n\n### 5. Conclusion: What else could you have done?\n\n> *\"We should have created a detailed timeline with checkpoints. We needed a communication plan beyond text messages and should have addressed participation issues immediately. Regular progress reviews would have identified problems earlier.\"*\n\n**Key Question:** What lessons can you draw from this experience?\n\n### 6. Action Plan: What would you do differently next time?\n\n> *\"In future group projects, I will suggest a project management approach with clear milestones. I'll advocate for weekly in-person meetings and a shared document to track progress. I'll also speak up earlier if I notice participation issues.\"*\n\n**Key Question:** How will you apply these insights to future situations?\n\n## Cognitive Biases: Hidden Influences on Decision-Making\n\nCognitive biases are systematic patterns of thinking that can lead to irrational judgments. Recognizing these biases helps us make better decisions.\n\n### Common Biases in Our Case Study:\n\n1. **Optimism Bias:** The team overestimated their ability to complete work quickly and underestimated the time needed.\n   > *\"We thought we could easily finish everything in the final week.\"*\n   > \n   > **Prevention Strategy:** Break projects into smaller milestones with buffer time built in.\n\n2. **Bystander Effect:** Team members waited for others to take initiative rather than stepping forward.\n   > *\"I assumed someone else would coordinate the research phase.\"*\n   > \n   > **Prevention Strategy:** Assign specific responsibilities with clear ownership and deadlines.\n\n3. **Confirmation Bias:** The team ignored early warning signs that the project was in trouble.\n   > *\"We convinced ourselves that missing the first meeting wasn't a big deal.\"*\n   > \n   > **Prevention Strategy:** Schedule regular check-ins to honestly assess progress and challenges.\n\n4. **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing with an ineffective approach because time had already been invested.\n   > *\"We stuck with our original plan too long even when it clearly wasn't working.\"*\n   > \n   > **Prevention Strategy:** Set criteria in advance for when to reevaluate or pivot from the original plan.\n\n## Your Turn: Setback Analysis Worksheet\n\n[Download the Setback Analysis Worksheet](https://excelhs.org/resources/setback-analysis-worksheet.pdf)\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Identify a personal academic setback you've experienced\n2. Work through each step of the Gibbs Reflective Cycle\n3. Consider which cognitive biases might have influenced your thinking\n4. Develop a specific action plan for similar situations in the future\n\n**Submission Options:**\n- Complete the worksheet and upload it to the assignment portal\n- Prepare to share key insights during our next discussion (optional)\n- Apply your analysis to an upcoming project and track the results\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Reflection is most valuable when structured and honest\n- Identifying cognitive biases helps prevent repeating mistakes\n- Effective action plans include specific, measurable steps\n- Learning from setbacks is a continuous process that builds resilience\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [Video: The Psychology of Cognitive Biases](https://excelhs.org/resources/cognitive-bias-video)\n- [Article: Applying Reflective Practice in Academic Settings](https://excelhs.org/resources/reflective-practice-article)\n- [Tool: Project Management Templates for Students](https://excelhs.org/resources/project-templates)",
