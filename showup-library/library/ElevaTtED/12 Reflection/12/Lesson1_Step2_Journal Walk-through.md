## Guided Example: Missing an Assignment Deadline

Let's walk through how to use this journal together. I'll demonstrate using a common scenario: missing an assignment deadline.

### Step 1: Record the Date and Event
**Date:** September 15, 2023
**Event:** I missed the deadline for my English essay that was due today.

> **PAUSE POINT 1:** Think about a recent academic challenge you faced at Excel High School. Write the date and briefly describe what happened in your journal.

### Step 2: Explore Your Feelings
**Feelings:** I felt anxious when I realized I had missed the deadline. I was disappointed in myself and worried about how it would affect my grade. I also felt embarrassed about having to explain to my teacher.

> **PAUSE POINT 2:** How did your situation make you feel? Be honest and specific about your emotions in your journal entry.

### Step 3: Identify the Lesson
**Lesson Learned:** I realized that I didn't properly track my assignments in my planner. I also noticed that I tend to underestimate how long assignments will take, which led to me running out of time. The main lesson is that I need a better system for managing deadlines and estimating work time.

> **PAUSE POINT 3:** What did you learn from your experience? What insight did you gain about yourself or the situation?

### Step 4: Create an Action Plan
**Action Plan:** I will start using the calendar in my Excel High School Student Portal with reminders set 3 days before deadlines. I'll break down large assignments into smaller tasks with their own mini-deadlines. I'll also contact my instructor through the messaging system about making up the assignment and be honest about my mistake.

> **PAUSE POINT 4:** What specific actions will you take based on what you've learned? How will you apply this lesson going forward?

## Benefits of Regular Reflection

* Identify patterns in your learning style
