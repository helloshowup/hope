## Purpose of Progress Dashboards

Progress dashboards are visual tools that help you track your journey toward achieving specific goals. They provide a clear, at-a-glance view of where you started, where you are now, and how close you are to reaching your targets. By using a dashboard, you can:

- Visualize your progress over time
- Identify trends or patterns in your performance
- Stay motivated by seeing incremental improvements
- Make data-driven decisions about adjusting your strategies

## Understanding Dashboard Columns

A basic progress dashboard typically includes these key columns:

1. **Goal**: The specific objective you're working toward (e.g., "Complete Algebra 1 module by Friday")
2. **Metric**: How you'll measure progress (e.g., "Percentage of lessons completed")
3. **Baseline**: Your starting point (e.g., "0% complete")
4. **Current**: Your most recent measurement (e.g., "75% complete")
5. **Status**: Visual indicator of progress (e.g., "On track" or color coding like green/yellow/red)

## Sample Academic Dashboard

Below is a simple example of what a progress dashboard might look like for your Excel High School coursework:

| Goal | Metric | Baseline | Current | Status |
|------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Complete English 9 Unit 3 | Percentage complete | 0% | 85% | On track |
| Improve Biology quiz scores | Average quiz score | 72% | 88% | Exceeded |
| Submit all History assignments | Number of missing assignments | 4 | 1 | In progress |
| Maintain daily study schedule | Study hours per week | 10 | 12 | Meeting goal |

## Free Tools for Creating Your Own Dashboards
