     * **S**pecific: Clearly defined what you want to accomplish
     * **M**easurable: Include concrete criteria to measure progress
     * **A**chievable: Realistic given your current situation
     * **R**elevant: Connected to your educational journey
     * **T**ime-bound: Include specific deadlines
   - Direct connections between each goal and your reflection insights
   - A realistic implementation timeline with checkpoints

2. Upload your completed SMART Goals document using the submission button below.

### Example Goal Format
```

REFLECTION CONNECTION: My reflection showed math is my weakest subject.
ACTION STEPS: 
- Schedule 3 hours of math study time each week
- Attend virtual tutoring sessions twice monthly
- Complete all practice problems, not just required ones
TIMELINE: Weekly study schedule starting immediately, with grade check at midterm (Oct 15)
```

| Criteria | Excellent (90-100%) | Satisfactory (70-89%) | Needs Improvement (<70%) |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
