    "<educational_content>\n# SMART Goals 2.0 Plan (Spiral 1)\n\n## Introduction\nSetting effective goals is essential for academic success and personal growth. SMART goals provide a structured framework that helps you create clear, achievable objectives. In this activity, you'll learn how to create SMART goals that align with your dashboard metrics.\n\n## What are SMART Goals?\nSMART is an acronym that stands for:\n- **S**pecific: Clear and well-defined\n- **M**easurable: Quantifiable to track progress\n- **A**chievable: Realistic and attainable\n- **R**elevant: Aligned with your broader objectives\n- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline or timeframe\n\n## SMART Goals Worksheet\n\nUse the table below to develop your SMART goals. Review the example first, then create your own goals.\n\n| Goal | Specific | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time-bound |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|\n| **EXAMPLE:** Improve math grade | I will raise my math grade from a C to a B | I will track my progress through weekly quiz scores and monthly test results | I will dedicate 30 minutes daily to math practice and seek help when needed | This aligns with my dashboard academic performance metrics and my college aspirations | By the end of this semester (December 15) |\n| **Academic Goal 1:** | | | | | |\n| **Academic Goal 2:** | | | | | |\n| **Personal Goal:** | | | | | |\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Create Two Academic Goals:**\n   - Review your academic performance metrics on your dashboard\n   - Choose two areas where you'd like to improve\n   - Complete all columns of the SMART framework for each goal\n\n2. **Create One Personal Goal:**\n   - This could relate to extracurricular activities, health, social skills, or any non-academic area\n   - Ensure it connects to relevant metrics on your dashboard (e.g., attendance, participation)\n   - Complete all columns of the SMART framework\n\n3. **Link to Dashboard Metrics:**\n   - For each goal, identify which specific dashboard metrics you'll use to track your progress\n   - Note how improvements in these goals will be reflected in your dashboard data\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\nAfter completing your SMART goals table, answer these questions:\n\n1. How will tracking these goals on your dashboard help you stay accountable?\n2. What potential obstacles might you face in achieving these goals, and how will you overcome them?\n3. How might your SMART goals evolve as you progress through the school year?\n\nRemember, effective goals are living documents. Revisit and revise your SMART goals regularly as you track your progress on your dashboard.\n</educational_content>",

Create **two academic SMART goals** related to your coursework at Excel High School\n2. Create **one personal SMART goal** that supports your overall well-being or personal development\n3. For each goal, complete all five SMART criteria in detail\n4. For the \"Measurable\" section, specifically identify which metrics on your student dashboard you will use to track progress\n\n## Connecting to Your Dashboard\nRemember to link each goal to specific metrics you can monitor on your Excel High School dashboard, such as:\n- Assignment grades\n- Course completion percentages\n- Login frequency\n- Study time tracking\n- Communication with instructors\n\n## Reflection Questions\nAfter completing your SMART goals, answer these questions:\n1. Which goal do you think will be most challenging to achieve and why?\n2. What specific actions will you take this week to begin making progress on each goal?\n3. How will you hold yourself accountable for these goals?\n\nSubmit your completed SMART Goals worksheet and reflection responses to your instructor.\n</educational_content>",
