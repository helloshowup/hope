This lesson introduces a six-step roadmap that will help you navigate your college and career planning journey with confidence and purpose.\n\n## The Six-Step Future Planning Roadmap\n\n### Step 1: Self-Assessment\nThe foundation of any good plan starts with understanding yourself. This involves:\n- Identifying your personal interests and passions\n- Recognizing your academic strengths and areas for growth\n- Exploring your values and what matters most to you\n- Considering your personality traits and how they align with different careers\n\n**Activity:** Take a moment to list three of your strongest skills and two areas where you'd like to improve. *Record these in your digital notebook or journal.*\n\n### Step 2: Pathway Exploration\nOnce you understand yourself better, it's time to explore potential paths:\n- Research various career fields that match your interests\n- Investigate different college majors and programs\n- Learn about technical training and certification options\n- Consider gap year, military service, entrepreneurship, or direct workforce entry\n\n**Activity:** Name two career fields that interest you and one type of education or training each might require. *What appeals to you about these fields?*\n\n### Step 3: Goal Alignment\nWith pathways in mind, you can set meaningful goals:\n- Create short-term goals (this semester, this year)\n- Develop medium-term goals (high school completion)\n- Establish long-term goals (college and career)\n- Ensure your goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound\n\n**Activity:** Write one short-term and one long-term goal related to your education. *Make sure they follow the SMART format.*\n\n### Step 4: Course Planning\nStrategic course selection helps you reach your goals:\n- Choose high school courses that align with college or career requirements\n- Take challenging classes that demonstrate academic rigor\n- Consider dual enrollment or AP/IB courses for college credit\n- Pursue electives that develop skills relevant to your interests\n\n**Activity:** What courses might you take next year that would support your future plans? *If you're an adult learner, what skills do you need to develop for your career goals?*\n\n### Step 5: Application Readiness\nPreparing for applications requires ongoing effort:\n- Maintain strong grades throughout high school\n- Prepare for standardized tests like the SAT or ACT (if applicable to your goals)\n- Participate in meaningful extracurricular activities or work experiences\n- Build relationships with potential recommendation writers\n- Research scholarship and financial aid opportunities\n\n**Activity:** List two activities (extracurricular, volunteer, work, or personal projects) that could strengthen your applications or resume.\n\n### Step 6: Portfolio Building\nCreating evidence of your achievements and growth:\n- Document volunteer experiences, community service, or work history\n- Collect examples of your best academic work\n- Record leadership roles and responsibilities\n- Track awards, honors, and recognitions\n- Develop a resume that highlights your accomplishments\n\n**Activity:** What is one achievement you've had that would be worth including in your portfolio? *How does this achievement demonstrate your skills or character?*\n\n## Why Start Planning Now?\n\nStarting your future planning early provides several advantages:\n- More time to explore options before making decisions\n- Opportunity to adjust your course selections strategically\n- Ability to build a stronger academic record and portfolio\n- Reduced stress during application seasons\n- Better preparation for financial planning for college or career training\n\nRemember, this six-step roadmap isn't a one-time activity but an ongoing process that will evolve as you grow and learn more about yourself and the opportunities available to you.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following this roadmap and starting your planning now, you're taking control of your future and setting yourself up for success. Each step builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive approach to planning that will serve you well throughout your educational journey.\n\n**Next Steps:** Review the resources available through Excel High School's Success Coach Pro program to help you implement this roadmap.
