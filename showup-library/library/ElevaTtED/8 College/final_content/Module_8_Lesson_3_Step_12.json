These typically include:\n\n- **Core Requirements**: English, Math, Science, Social Studies\n- **Required Electives**: Physical Education, Health, Fine Arts\n- **General Electives**: Additional courses of your choice\n\nEvery college and career path has different expectations, which is why understanding these requirements early helps you build a strategic plan.\n\n## Navigating Prerequisite Chains\n\nMany courses build upon prior knowledge. For example:\n- Algebra I \u2192 Geometry \u2192 Algebra II \u2192 Pre-Calculus \u2192 Calculus\n- Biology \u2192 Chemistry \u2192 Physics or Advanced Biology\n- English 9 \u2192 English 10 \u2192 English 11 \u2192 English 12\n\nIdentifying these prerequisite chains early allows you to:\n1. Plan multiple years ahead\n2. Avoid scheduling conflicts\n3. Ensure you complete necessary foundational courses\n4. Access advanced courses that align with your goals\n\n## Strategic Elective Selection\n\nElectives are powerful tools for:\n- Exploring potential career interests\n- Developing specialized skills\n- Demonstrating commitment to college admissions\n- Balancing your academic experience\n\nThe key is choosing electives that serve your goals while providing a well-rounded education.\n\n## Case Study: Maya - Arts Focus with STEM Balance\n\nMaya is a junior at Excel High School who dreams of attending a competitive arts program for digital animation. Let's examine her course planning strategy:\n\n**Core Requirements:**\n- Completed standard English, Math, Science, and Social Studies through sophomore year\n\n**Arts Focus:**\n- Digital Arts I and II (completed)\n- Advanced Drawing (current)\n- Animation Fundamentals (planned)\n- Portfolio Development (senior year)\n\n**Strategic STEM Electives:**\n- Computer Science Principles (completed) - Provides programming foundation useful for digital animation\n- Physics (current) - Helps understand motion and light principles that improve animation quality\n- Statistics (planned) - Useful for understanding user experience metrics in digital media\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Maintained 3.5+ GPA in all courses\n- Participates in Digital Arts Club\n- Summer internship at local design studio\n\n**Maya's Strategy:**\n1. Identified core animation program requirements at target colleges\n2. Selected STEM electives that directly support animation skills\n3. Maintained balance between artistic development and technical knowledge\n4. Created portfolio opportunities through strategic course selection\n\n## Activity: Building Your Aligned Course Plan\n\n1. **Goal Identification**\n   - What are your top 2-3 potential career fields or college majors?\n   - What skills and knowledge are required for success in these areas?\n   - **Pro Tip:** Not sure about your goals yet? That's completely normal! Consider courses that keep multiple pathways open while you explore.\n\n2. **Requirement Mapping**\n   - List your remaining graduation requirements\n   - Research prerequisite chains for advanced courses in your interest areas\n   - Identify specific courses that colleges in your field recommend\n   - **Resource:** Use the Excel High School Graduation Requirements Checklist in your Student Portal to track your progress\n\n3. **Course Selection Strategy**\n   - Plot courses across remaining semesters\n   - Balance core requirements with strategic electives\n   - Identify potential scheduling conflicts or prerequisite issues\n   - **Time Management Tip:** Consider your personal schedule and other commitments when planning course load each semester\n\n4. **Reflection Questions**\n   - How do your selected courses align with your goals?\n   - What potential gaps exist in your current plan?\n   - How will you balance pursuing your interests with maintaining a well-rounded education?\n   - **Action Step:** Schedule a meeting with your Success Coach to review your plan and get personalized feedback\n\nRemember, your course plan is a living document that may evolve as your interests and goals develop. The key is making intentional choices that open doors to your future rather than limiting your options.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Complete the Course Planning Worksheet in your Student Portal\n- Review your plan with your parent/guardian or Success Coach\n- Update your plan each semester as you progress and your goals evolve",
