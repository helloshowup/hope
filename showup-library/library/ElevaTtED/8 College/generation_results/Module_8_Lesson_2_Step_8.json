This practical skill will help you make informed decisions about your educational and career journey.\n\n## Demonstration Overview\nIn this screen-share recording, I'll walk you through:\n1. Accessing and navigating the O*NET OnLine database\n2. Using filters to narrow down occupation options\n3. Exporting career data for further analysis\n4. Identifying transferable skills between two different majors\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Accessing O*NET OnLine\nFirst, I'll navigate to [O*NET OnLine](https://www.onetonline.org/), a free resource sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. This comprehensive database contains information on hundreds of occupations.\n\n### Filtering Occupations\nWatch as I demonstrate how to:\n- Use the \"Find Occupations\" feature\n- Apply filters for education level (Bachelor's degree)\n- Filter by career clusters (e.g., Business, Management & Administration)\n- Narrow results by job outlook and median wages\n\n### Exporting Data\nI'll show you how to:\n- Select specific occupations for comparison\n- Export the data to a spreadsheet format\n- Save the information for later reference and analysis\n\n### Comparing Two Different Majors\nFor this example, I'll compare career paths between:\n- Business Administration major\n- Communications major\n\n### Identifying Transferable Skills\nWatch as I identify skills that transfer between these majors, including:\n- Communication skills (written and verbal)\n- Critical thinking and problem-solving\n- Project management\n- Research and analysis capabilities\n- Leadership potential\n\n## Application Exercise\nAfter watching this demonstration, you should be able to:\n1. Conduct your own career research using O*NET\n2. Export and analyze occupation data\n3. Identify transferable skills between different educational paths\n4. Make more informed decisions about potential majors and career paths\n\n## Conclusion\nThis demonstration shows how career research tools like O*NET can help you explore various career paths and understand how different college majors might align with your goals and interests. Remember that identifying transferable skills is key to understanding the flexibility you'll have in the job market regardless of your chosen major.\n</educational_content>",

This practical skill will help you make informed decisions about your educational and career journey.\n\n## Demonstration Overview\nIn this screen-share recording, I'll walk through:\n1. Accessing and navigating O*NET OnLine\n2. Filtering occupations based on specific criteria\n3. Exporting career data for analysis\n4. Identifying transferable skills between two different majors\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Accessing O*NET\nFirst, I'll navigate to [O*NET OnLine](https://www.onetonline.org/), a free resource provided by the U.S. Department of Labor that contains detailed information about hundreds of occupations.\n\n### Filtering Occupations\nWatch as I use the \"Find Occupations\" feature to:\n- Filter by career cluster (e.g., Business Management vs. Health Science)\n- Narrow results by education level required\n- Sort occupations by median wages and job outlook\n\n### Exporting Data\nI'll demonstrate how to:\n- Save occupation information as PDF files\n- Export lists of occupations to spreadsheets\n- Create comparison charts between different career paths\n\n### Analyzing Transferable Skills\nFor this example, I'll compare two different majors:\n- Business Administration\n- Healthcare Administration\n\nNotice how I identify common skills between these fields, such as:\n- Communication and interpersonal skills\n- Project management abilities\n- Data analysis competencies\n- Leadership qualities\n\n## Application Exercise\nAfter watching this demonstration, you should be able to:\n1. Use O*NET to research careers aligned with your interests\n2. Export and organize career information for comparison\n3. Identify skills that transfer between different career paths\n4. Make more informed decisions about potential majors\n\n## Conclusion\nThis research approach helps you see how skills developed in one field can apply to others, giving you flexibility in your career planning. Remember that your school counselor and community career resources can provide additional guidance as you explore your options.\n\n## Next Steps\nTry this research process with two career paths that interest you, and document the transferable skills you discover between them.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Career Path Research Demo\n\n## Introduction\nWelcome to this demonstration on conducting career path research! In this session, we'll explore how to use O*NET (Occupational Information Network), a valuable online resource for career exploration. You'll learn how to filter occupations, export useful data, and identify transferable skills between different college majors.\n\n## Demonstration Overview\nIn this screen-share recording, I'll guide you through:\n1. Navigating the O*NET website\n2. Using filters to narrow down occupation choices\n3. Exporting occupation data for further analysis\n4. Comparing two different majors to identify transferable skills\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Accessing O*NET\nFirst, I'll navigate to [O*NET Online](https://www.onetonline.org/), which is a comprehensive database of occupational information. This free resource contains detailed information about hundreds of occupations.\n\n### Filtering Occupations\nWatch as I demonstrate how to:\n- Use the \"Find Occupations\" feature\n- Apply multiple filters such as:\n  * Education level required\n  * Projected growth\n  * Salary ranges\n  * Work values and interests\n\nFor our example, I'll filter for occupations requiring a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, then compare with occupations in Communications.\n\n### Exporting Data\nOnce we've filtered to relevant occupations, I'll show you how to:\n- Select specific occupations for deeper investigation\n- Export occupation details to save for later reference\n- Create comparison charts of key data points\n\n### Identifying Transferable Skills\nThe most valuable part of this process is recognizing transferable skills between different majors. I'll demonstrate:\n- How to identify core competencies from both Business and Communications majors\n- Which skills overlap between these fields\n- How to leverage these transferable skills when considering career changes\n\nFor example, both majors develop strong communication abilities, analytical thinking, and project management skills\u2014all highly valued across multiple industries.\n\n## Practical Application\nThis research method helps you:\n- Make informed decisions about college majors\n- Understand various career paths within a field of study\n- Recognize the flexibility your skills provide in the job market\n- Prepare targeted resumes highlighting relevant transferable skills\n\n## Conclusion\nUsing O*NET effectively allows you to research career options systematically and identify valuable connections between different educational pathways. Remember that many skills are transferable across industries, giving you flexibility in your career journey.\n</educational_content>"
