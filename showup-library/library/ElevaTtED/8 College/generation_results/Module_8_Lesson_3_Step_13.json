This tutorial will guide you through creating a comprehensive four-year plan using Google Sheets, helping you visualize your academic path, ensure you meet all requirements, and maintain a balanced workload throughout your high school career.\n\n## Setting Up Your Four-Year Plan Spreadsheet\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Google Sheet\n1. Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)\n2. Click \"Blank\" to create a new spreadsheet\n3. Rename your document \"My Four-Year High School Plan\"\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Your Basic Structure\n1. Create column headers for each semester:\n   * Column A: Course Categories\n   * Columns B-C: 9th Grade (Fall/Spring)\n   * Columns D-E: 10th Grade (Fall/Spring)\n   * Columns F-G: 11th Grade (Fall/Spring)\n   * Columns H-I: 12th Grade (Fall/Spring)\n\n2. Add row headers for course types:\n   * English\n   * Mathematics\n   * Science\n   * Social Studies\n   * Foreign Language\n   * Electives\n   * Total Credits\n\n## Color-Coding Your Semesters\n\n### Step 3: Apply Color Coding\n1. Select columns B-C (9th grade)\n2. Click the fill color tool and choose a light blue\n3. Color 10th grade columns (D-E) light green\n4. Color 11th grade columns (F-G) light yellow\n5. Color 12th grade columns (H-I) light orange\n\nThis visual organization helps you quickly identify each academic year and semester.\n\n## Adding Prerequisite Checks with Conditional Formatting\n\n### Step 4: Set Up Prerequisite Validation\n1. Select the cell where a course with prerequisites will be placed\n2. Click Format \u2192 Conditional formatting\n3. Choose \"Custom formula is\" and enter a formula like:\n   * `=IF(ISBLANK(D4),TRUE,NOT(ISBLANK(B4)))`\n   * This checks if the prerequisite course was taken before the current course\n4. Set the formatting to highlight the cell red if the condition is false\n\nFor example, if Algebra II requires Algebra I, the conditional formatting will alert you if you try to schedule Algebra II without first completing Algebra I.\n\n## Workload Balance Tips\n\n### Step 5: Track and Balance Your Workload\n1. Create a row labeled \"Course Difficulty\" below your plan\n2. Assign difficulty ratings to each course (1=Easy, 3=Medium, 5=Challenging)\n3. Use the SUM function to calculate each semester's difficulty score\n4. Aim for balanced difficulty scores across semesters\n\n### Step 6: Credit Tracking\n1. In the \"Total Credits\" row, use the COUNTA function to count courses per semester\n2. Create a running total to ensure you'll meet graduation requirements\n\n## Final Tips for Success\n\n* Review graduation requirements and ensure your plan meets them\n* Balance challenging courses across semesters to avoid burnout\n* Include extracurricular activities in your planning\n* Revisit and adjust your plan at the end of each semester\n* Share your plan with your guidance counselor for feedback\n\nThis four-year plan will serve as your roadmap through high school, helping you stay on track toward graduation and your future goals.\n</educational_content>",

This tutorial will guide you through creating a comprehensive four-year plan using Google Sheets that will help you visualize your course sequence, ensure you meet all prerequisites, and maintain a balanced workload throughout your high school career.\n\n## Setting Up Your Google Sheets Plan\n\n### Step 1: Create Your Basic Structure\n1. Open a new Google Sheet\n2. Label columns for each semester (Fall 9th, Spring 9th, Fall 10th, etc.)\n3. Create rows for different subject areas (English, Math, Science, Social Studies, Electives, etc.)\n\n### Step 2: Implement Color-Coding for Semesters\nColor-coding makes your plan visually intuitive:\n- Use light blue for fall semesters\n- Use light green for spring semesters\n- Use yellow to highlight graduation requirements\n- Use purple to mark college prep courses\n\nTo apply colors:\n1. Select the cells for a specific semester\n2. Click on the \"Fill color\" tool in the toolbar\n3. Choose your designated color\n\n## Adding Prerequisite Checks with Conditional Formatting\n\nConditional formatting helps ensure you don't schedule courses before completing prerequisites:\n\n1. Select the cells containing advanced courses\n2. Click Format \u2192 Conditional formatting\n3. Choose \"Custom formula is\" from the dropdown menu\n4. For example, to check if Algebra 1 is completed before Algebra 2, use:\n   `=COUNTIF(A1:D5,\"Algebra 1\")=0`\n5. Set the formatting to highlight the cell in red if the condition is true\n6. Add a note explaining the prerequisite requirement\n\n## Balancing Your Workload\n\n### Creating a Credit and Workload Calculator\n1. Add a row at the bottom of each semester column to sum up credits\n2. Create a \"difficulty rating\" for each course (1-3 scale)\n3. Add a formula to calculate the total difficulty per semester\n4. Use conditional formatting to highlight semesters with:\n   - Too many difficult courses (red)\n   - Balanced workload (green)\n   - Too light workload (yellow)\n\n### Sample Formula for Workload Balance\n```\n=IF(SUM(E2:E7)>15,\"Too heavy\",IF(SUM(E2:E7)<10,\"Too light\",\"Balanced\"))\n```\n\n## Tips for Effective Planning\n\n1. **Front-load requirements**: Complete graduation requirements early to allow flexibility in junior and senior years\n2. **Consider summer options**: Add a column for summer courses if needed\n3. **Include extracurriculars**: Create a section to track non-academic commitments\n4. **Add notes**: Use comments to record important deadlines or considerations\n5. **Review regularly**: Update your plan each semester as your goals evolve\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour four-year plan is a living document that will evolve as you progress through high school. By using color-coding, prerequisite checks, and workload balancing tools, you'll create a visual roadmap that helps you stay on track toward your goals while maintaining a healthy academic balance.\n</educational_content>",
