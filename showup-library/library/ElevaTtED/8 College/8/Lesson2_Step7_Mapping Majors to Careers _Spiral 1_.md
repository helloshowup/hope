## Understanding Career Metrics

### Salary Information

When researching careers, you'll encounter various salary metrics:

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Median Salary** | The middle point where half of workers earn more and half earn less | Gives you the most realistic picture of typical earnings |
| **Entry-Level Salary** | What you might expect to earn when first entering the field | Helps with short-term financial planning |
| **Experienced Salary** | What you might earn after gaining experience | Shows potential for growth over time |
| **Regional Variations** | How salaries differ based on location | Important for deciding where to live and work |

### Job Growth Projections

Growth metrics help you understand the future demand for specific careers:

| Growth Category | 10-Year Projection | What This Means For You |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Declining** | Negative growth percentage | Jobs may be harder to find; consider related fields |
| **Average** | 3-7% growth | Stable job market with typical turnover |
| **Faster than average** | 8-14% growth | Good opportunities for new graduates |
| **Much faster than average** | 15% or higher growth | High demand for qualified candidates |

### Skills Demand

Understanding which skills are in demand can help you prepare for your chosen career:

- **Hard Skills:** Technical abilities specific to a job (programming languages, equipment operation, certification knowledge)
- **Soft Skills:** Interpersonal abilities valued across industries (communication, teamwork, problem-solving)
- **Emerging Skills:** New abilities becoming important in your field (often technology-related)

## Checkpoint: Quick Knowledge Check

Before moving on to the activity, test your understanding:

1. What's the difference between median salary and entry-level salary?
2. If a career has a 12% growth projection, how would the BLS categorize this growth?
3. Name one key feature of O*NET that helps connect your interests to potential careers.

## Activity: Career-Major Mapping

**Instructions:** Complete this activity to create a personalized career-major map.

1. Choose two careers that interest you
2. Use O*NET to identify:
   - Required education and training
   - Core skills needed
   - Related majors
3. Use the BLS to research:
   - Salary information
   - Job outlook
4. Find a university program finder to identify specific majors that align with these careers
5. Create a simple table or diagram showing the connections between:
   - Your interests
   - Potential majors
   - Possible careers
   - Key skills needed
   - Education requirements

**Reflection Questions:**
- What surprised you about the connections between majors and careers?
- Did you discover any new career possibilities you hadn't considered before?
- Based on your research, what skills should you start developing now?

By using these powerful tools together, you can create a clearer picture of how your academic choices connect to potential career paths, helping you make more informed decisions about your educational journey.
