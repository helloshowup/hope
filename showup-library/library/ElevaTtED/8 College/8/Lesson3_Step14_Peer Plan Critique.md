# Peer Plan Critique

# Peer Plan Critique Activity

## Overview
In this activity, you will share your academic plan with peers and provide valuable feedback to others. This collaborative exercise helps align your current academic courses with long-term career or college goals while gaining insights from your classmates.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, you will:
- Evaluate the alignment between academic plans and career/college goals
- Apply critical thinking to assess educational pathways
- Provide constructive feedback to peers
- Refine your own academic plan based on peer insights

## Instructions

### Part 1: Post Your Plan (Due: [specific date])
1. Take a screenshot of your academic/career plan that you've developed.
2. Post your plan screenshot to the discussion board with a brief explanation (150-200 words) of:
   - Your intended career or college goals
   - How your current courses support these goals
   - Any concerns or questions you have about your plan

### Part 2: Evaluate Peer Plans (Due: [specific date])
Select two classmates' plans to evaluate using the following alignment checklist:

**Alignment Checklist:**
1. **Goal Match**
   - Do the selected courses clearly support their stated goals?
   - Are there any recommended courses they should consider adding?

2. **Workload Balance**
   - Is the course load realistic and manageable?
   - Is there a good balance between challenging courses and those that play to their strengths?

3. **Fallback Options**
   - Does the plan include alternative paths if original goals change?
   - Are there contingency options for challenging courses?

### Part 3: Provide Constructive Feedback
Write a 100-150 word response to each peer, addressing all points in the alignment checklist. Your feedback should:
- Be specific and actionable
- Include at least one strength of their plan
- Offer 1-2 concrete suggestions for improvement
- Maintain a supportive and encouraging tone

## Example Feedback
"Hi Taylor, I like how your course selections in biology and chemistry align with your pre-med goals. Your plan shows good balance between science courses and humanities. One suggestion would be to consider adding Statistics in your junior year, as data analysis is increasingly important in medical fields. Also, have you thought about a backup plan if organic chemistry proves challenging? Perhaps identifying a summer option could provide flexibility. Overall, your plan is well-structured for your medical school aspirations!"

## Completion Criteria
To successfully complete this activity, you must:
- Post your own plan with a clear explanation
- Complete two peer evaluations using the alignment checklist
- Provide constructive, specific feedback to each peer
- Respond to at least one comment on your own plan
