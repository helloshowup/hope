Added inclusivity for adult learners by expanding options in Step 2 to include direct workforce entry and adding alternative prompts in Step 4 specifically for adult learners.\n\n3. Made standardized testing language more flexible (\"if applicable to your goals\") to acknowledge that not all learners are on a traditional college path.\n\n4. Expanded activity prompts to encourage deeper reflection (e.g., \"What appeals to you about these fields?\").\n\n5. Added a \"Next Steps\" section at the conclusion to connect learners with Excel High School's Success Coach Pro resources, creating a bridge between the lesson and available support services.\n\n6. Broadened language throughout to be inclusive of both traditional students and adult learners (e.g., \"work experiences\" alongside \"extracurricular activities\").\n\nThese changes better support the diverse learner segments at Excel High School while maintaining the educational value of the original content.",

      "review_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the content for Excel High School's diverse learner segments:\n\n1. Added more specific details about Excel's support resources (Success Coaches, BRYTE AI Tutor, Student Portal) to connect with the platform features mentioned in the learner profile.\n\n2. Enhanced the micro-credentials section with more detailed examples to demonstrate real-world relevance, which is important for adult learners and \"second-chance\" learners.\n\n3. Added self-assessment questions to the decision guide to promote reflection and self-direction, addressing the \"Self-Direction Aids\" instructional design driver.\n\n4. Expanded the \"Next Steps\" section with more specific tools (transcript evaluation, Career Exploration tool) to provide clearer structure and navigation.\n\n5. Added information about immediate support options (chat feature) to address the need for timely feedback and assistance.\n\n6. Improved language throughout to be more encouraging and supportive, particularly for \"second-chance\" learners who need an empathetic climate.\n\nThese changes better align the content with the learner profile by incorporating UDL principles, providing clearer structure with flexibility, and emphasizing the support systems available to students.",
