This practical skill will help you make informed decisions about your educational and career journey at Excel High School and beyond.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nAfter completing this demonstration, you will be able to:\n1. Navigate O*NET OnLine to research potential careers\n2. Filter and compare occupations based on your specific interests and goals\n3. Identify transferable skills between different career paths\n4. Apply this research process to inform your own educational planning\n\n## Step-by-Step Demonstration\n\n### Accessing O*NET\nFirst, I'll navigate to [O*NET OnLine](https://www.onetonline.org/), a free resource provided by the U.S. Department of Labor that contains detailed information about hundreds of occupations.\n\n*[Screenshot of O*NET homepage with key navigation elements highlighted]*\n\n### Filtering Occupations\nWatch as I use the \"Find Occupations\" feature to:\n- Filter by career cluster (e.g., Business Management vs. Health Science)\n- Narrow results by education level required\n- Sort occupations by median wages and job outlook\n\n*[Screenshot showing filters being applied with annotations]*\n\n**Pro Tip:** Start with broader categories before narrowing down to specific occupations to avoid missing potential career matches.\n\n### Exporting and Organizing Data\nI'll demonstrate how to:\n- Save occupation information as PDF files\n- Export lists of occupations to spreadsheets\n- Create comparison charts between different career paths\n\n*[Screenshot showing export options with key buttons highlighted]*\n\n### Analyzing Transferable Skills: A Real-World Example\nFor this example, I'll compare two different majors:\n- Business Administration\n- Healthcare Administration\n\n| Skill Category | Business Administration | Healthcare Administration | Transferability |\n|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| Communication | Client presentations, business writing | Patient communication, medical documentation | High |\n| Analysis | Market research, financial forecasting | Healthcare data analysis, resource allocation | Medium-High |\n| Leadership | Team management, project coordination | Department supervision, care coordination | High |\n| Technical | CRM systems, spreadsheet analysis | Electronic health records, medical coding | Medium |\n\n**Key Insight:** Notice how skills like communication, analysis, and leadership transfer well between these fields, giving you career flexibility.\n\n## Your Turn: Application Exercise\nAfter watching this demonstration:\n1. Choose two career paths that interest you\n2. Use O*NET to research each path (minimum 3 occupations per path)\n3. Create a comparison chart identifying at least 5 transferable skills\n4. Reflect on how this information might influence your educational choices\n\n**Submission Tip:** Include screenshots of your O*NET searches to show your research process.\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [Bureau of Labor Statistics Career Outlook](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/)\n- Excel High School Career Planning Guide (available in your Student Portal)\n- Schedule a meeting with your Success Coach for personalized career guidance\n\n## Conclusion\nThis research approach helps you see how skills developed in one field can apply to others, giving you flexibility in your career planning. Remember that your Excel High School counselor and community career resources can provide additional guidance as you explore your options.",
