This practical skill will help you make informed decisions about your educational and career journey.\n\n## Demonstration Overview\nIn this screen-share recording, I'll walk through:\n1. Accessing and navigating O*NET OnLine\n2. Filtering occupations based on specific criteria\n3. Exporting career data for analysis\n4. Identifying transferable skills between two different majors\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Accessing O*NET\nFirst, I'll navigate to [O*NET OnLine](https://www.onetonline.org/), a free resource provided by the U.S. Department of Labor that contains detailed information about hundreds of occupations.\n\n### Filtering Occupations\nWatch as I use the \"Find Occupations\" feature to:\n- Filter by career cluster (e.g., Business Management vs. Health Science)\n- Narrow results by education level required\n- Sort occupations by median wages and job outlook\n\n### Exporting Data\nI'll demonstrate how to:\n- Save occupation information as PDF files\n- Export lists of occupations to spreadsheets\n- Create comparison charts between different career paths\n\n### Analyzing Transferable Skills\nFor this example, I'll compare two different majors:\n- Business Administration\n- Healthcare Administration\n\nNotice how I identify common skills between these fields, such as:\n- Communication and interpersonal skills\n- Project management abilities\n- Data analysis competencies\n- Leadership qualities\n\n## Application Exercise\nAfter watching this demonstration, you should be able to:\n1. Use O*NET to research careers aligned with your interests\n2. Export and organize career information for comparison\n3. Identify skills that transfer between different career paths\n4. Make more informed decisions about potential majors\n\n## Conclusion\nThis research approach helps you see how skills developed in one field can apply to others, giving you flexibility in your career planning. Remember that your school counselor and community career resources can provide additional guidance as you explore your options.\n\n## Next Steps\nTry this research process with two career paths that interest you, and document the transferable skills you discover between them.",
