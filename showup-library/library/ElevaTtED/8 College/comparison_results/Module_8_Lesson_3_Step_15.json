This guide will help you create strong application components that will make you stand out to college admissions officers. We'll focus on two critical elements: crafting a well-structured r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and developing a compelling personal statement.\n\n## Part 1: R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Structure\n\nA strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9 presents your achievements clearly and concisely. Follow this structure:\n\n1. **Header**: Include your name, contact information, and optional professional links\n2. **Education**: List your high school, GPA, expected graduation date, and relevant coursework\n3. **Experience**: Detail work, volunteer, and leadership roles\n4. **Skills**: Highlight technical, language, and other relevant abilities\n5. **Activities/Honors**: Showcase extracurricular involvement and recognitions\n\n### Strong Verb Bullet Points\n\nFor each experience entry, create 2-3 bullet points that begin with strong action verbs. These demonstrate your impact rather than just listing responsibilities.\n\n**Weak**: Responsible for tutoring students in math\n**Strong**: Tutored 15 middle school students in algebra, improving class average by 12%\n\n**Action Verb Examples:**\n- Achieved, Developed, Implemented\n- Coordinated, Led, Managed\n- Created, Designed, Established\n- Analyzed, Evaluated, Researched\n\n## Part 2: STAR Personal Statement Framework\n\nThe STAR method helps structure compelling stories for your personal statement:\n\n- **Situation**: Set the context\n- **Task**: Explain your responsibility or challenge\n- **Action**: Describe what you did specifically\n- **Result**: Share the outcome and what you learned\n\n### Example STAR Paragraph:\n*When our school's recycling program was failing (Situation), I volunteered to revitalize the initiative (Task). I researched effective programs, recruited a team of 10 students, and designed educational materials for classrooms (Action). Within three months, our school's recycling increased by 60%, and we received district recognition for environmental leadership (Result).*\n\n## Editable Templates\n\nDownload these templates to begin crafting your application materials:\n\n1. [R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Template](https://excelhs.org/resources/resume-template) - Includes properly formatted sections and sample bullet points\n2. [Personal Statement Worksheet](https://excelhs.org/resources/personal-statement) - Provides STAR framework prompts and space to develop your narrative\n\n## Practice Activity\n\n1. Create a draft r\u00e9sum\u00e9 using the template\n2. Write one STAR paragraph about a meaningful experience\n3. Exchange with a peer for feedback using the provided rubric\n4. Revise based on feedback\n\nRemember, this is just the first spiral. We'll continue refining these documents throughout the course to ensure your application materials showcase your unique strengths and experiences.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn our next session, we'll focus on tailoring your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for specific programs and developing a complete personal statement draft. Bring your completed templates to class for review.",
