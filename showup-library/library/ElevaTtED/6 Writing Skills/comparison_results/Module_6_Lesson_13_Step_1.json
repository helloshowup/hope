While arguments do include claims (A), evidence to support those claims (B), and address potential counterarguments (D), unsupported personal opinions weaken an argument's credibility.*\n\n**Question 2:** What is a thesis statement?\n- A) A question that guides research\n- B) A central claim that states the main argument\n- C) A summary of all evidence\n- D) A list of topics to be covered\n\n**Answer: B) A central claim that states the main argument**\n\n*Explanation: A thesis statement presents the central argument of your paper. It's not merely a question (A), a summary of evidence (C), or a topic list (D), but rather the specific position you're arguing for throughout your paper.*\n\n**Question 3:** Which transition word signals a contrasting idea?\n- A) Furthermore\n- B) Similarly\n- C) However\n- D) Therefore\n\n**Answer: C) However**\n\n*Explanation: \"However\" indicates a contrast or contradiction between ideas. \"Furthermore\" and \"Similarly\" (A and B) signal additional supporting points, while \"Therefore\" (D) indicates a conclusion based on previous information.*\n\n**Question 4:** What makes evidence \"relevant\" in an argument?\n- A) It comes from a recent source\n- B) It directly connects to and supports your claim\n- C) It includes statistical data\n- D) It comes from a famous expert\n\n**Answer: B) It directly connects to and supports your claim**\n\n*Explanation: Relevant evidence has a clear connection to your claim. While recent sources (A), statistics (C), and expert opinions (D) can be valuable, they're only relevant if they specifically support your argument.*\n\n**Question 5:** Which is the most effective way to strengthen an argument?\n- A) Using emotional language\n- B) Adding more adjectives\n- C) Addressing counterarguments\n- D) Making the conclusion longer\n\n**Answer: C) Addressing counterarguments**\n\n*Explanation: Acknowledging and responding to opposing viewpoints demonstrates critical thinking and strengthens your position. Emotional language (A) and excessive adjectives (B) can weaken arguments, while a longer conclusion (D) doesn't necessarily improve quality.*\n\n## Scenario Question\n\n**Scenario:** You are writing an argument that school start times should be later. Which piece of evidence would MOST strengthen your argument?\n\n- A) A personal story about feeling tired in morning classes\n- B) A scientific study showing teenagers naturally have later sleep cycles\n- C) A quote from a student saying they prefer sleeping in\n- D) An observation that some teachers also arrive tired\n\n**Answer: B) A scientific study showing teenagers naturally have later sleep cycles**\n\n*Explanation: Scientific research provides objective, credible evidence that directly supports your claim about school start times. Personal stories (A), individual preferences (C), and casual observations (D) are weaker forms of evidence compared to peer-reviewed scientific findings.*",
