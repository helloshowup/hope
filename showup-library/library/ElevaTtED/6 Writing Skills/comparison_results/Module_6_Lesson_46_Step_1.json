For example:\n\n**Content Quality:**\n* Presents accurate, relevant information\n* Supports claims with specific evidence\n* Demonstrates thorough understanding of the topic\n* Shows depth of analysis beyond surface-level observations\n\n### Step 3: Create an Infographic\nTransform your rubric into a visually appealing infographic using a tool like Canva, Piktochart, or Google Drawings. Ensure your design is:\n* Clear and easily readable\n* Visually organized\n* Professional in appearance\n\n### Step 4: Share Your Creation\nPost your completed infographic file in the course forum with a brief explanation of how your enhanced rubric will improve peer feedback quality.\n\nRemember: An effective rubric provides specific, actionable criteria that helps both the reviewer provide targeted feedback and the recipient understand areas for improvement.",
