A structured draft serves as the foundation for your final essay, allowing you to develop your ideas methodically while ensuring your argument flows coherently. This lesson will guide you through the process of expanding an outline into a 500-word draft with proper headings and organization.\n\n## Using the Outline Template\n\nBefore drafting your essay, start with a basic outline template:\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Hook/attention grabber\n   - Background information\n   - Thesis statement\n\n2. **Body Paragraph 1**\n   - Topic sentence\n   - Supporting evidence/examples\n   - Analysis\n   - Transition to next paragraph\n\n3. **Body Paragraph 2**\n   - Topic sentence\n   - Supporting evidence/examples\n   - Analysis\n   - Transition to next paragraph\n\n4. **Body Paragraph 3** (if needed)\n   - Topic sentence\n   - Supporting evidence/examples\n   - Analysis\n   - Transition to conclusion\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Restate thesis (in different words)\n   - Summarize main points\n   - Closing thought/call to action\n\n## Expanding Your Outline to 500 Words\n\nWhen expanding your outline to a 500-word draft, allocate your word count strategically:\n- Introduction: 75-100 words\n- Body paragraphs: 100-125 words each (300-375 total)\n- Conclusion: 75-100 words\n\nFor each section, develop your ideas by adding specific details, examples, and explanations that support your thesis. Remember that this is a draft, so focus on getting your ideas down rather than perfecting your language.\n\n## Applying Headings and Subheadings\n\nIncorporate headings and subheadings to organize your draft:\n\n1. Use a descriptive title that captures your essay's main idea\n2. Include section headings for major parts (Introduction, Body, Conclusion)\n3. Consider subheadings for complex body sections to further organize ideas\n4. Format headings consistently (size, style, capitalization)\n\nHeadings improve readability and help both you and your reader follow the logical progression of your argument.\n\n## Creating a Bullet Summary\n\nAfter completing your draft, create a bullet summary that captures the key points:\n\n- List 3-5 main arguments or ideas from your essay\n- Keep each bullet point concise (1-2 sentences)\n- Ensure the summary reflects your thesis and major supporting points\n- Use parallel structure for consistency\n\nThis summary serves as a quick reference for your essay's core content and helps ensure your draft addresses your intended purpose.\n\n## Submitting Your Work\n\nWhen submitting your structured essay draft, include:\n\n1. Your original outline\n2. Your 500-word draft with proper headings\n3. Your bullet summary\n4. Any questions or areas where you need feedback\n\nRemember that this draft is a stepping stone toward your final essay. The structured approach allows for easier revision and refinement in later stages of the writing process.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Begin with a comprehensive outline using the template provided\n- Expand your outline to approximately 500 words, developing each section\n- Apply clear, consistent headings to organize your content\n- Create a concise bullet summary of your main points\n- Submit both your outline and draft for feedback",
