This brief writing exercise will help you develop skills in brainstorming, drafting, and revising - fundamental techniques that apply to all forms of writing.\n\n## Materials Needed\n- The Micro-Essay Tracker document (downloadable below)\n- Word processor or paper for drafting\n\n## Step 1: Download the Tracker\nDownload the [Micro-Essay Tracker](https://excelhs.org/resources/micro-essay-tracker.pdf) document. This fillable form will help you organize your thoughts and track your progress through the writing process.\n\n## Step 2: Choose Your Topic\nSelect a topic that interests you from the following options:\n- A skill I recently learned\n- My favorite place\n- A person who inspires me\n- A challenge I overcame\n- A goal I'm working toward\n\nRecord your chosen topic on the tracker.\n\n## Step 3: Brainstorm Ideas\nCreate a bullet list of at least 5-7 points related to your topic. These can include:\n- Key details you want to include\n- Specific examples\n- Personal connections\n- Descriptive elements\n- Main message or point\n\nList these ideas on your tracker in the brainstorming section.\n\n## Step 4: Draft Your Micro-Essay\nUsing your brainstorming points as a guide, write a first draft of your micro-essay. Your draft should:\n- Be approximately 150 words\n- Have a clear beginning, middle, and end\n- Include specific details from your brainstorming\n- Express your personal perspective\n\nWrite your draft in the designated section of the tracker.\n\n## Step 5: Revise Your Work\nAfter completing your draft, take time to revise it once. Consider:\n- Clarity: Are your ideas expressed clearly?\n- Organization: Does the essay flow logically?\n- Word choice: Could you use more precise or engaging language?\n- Details: Have you included enough specific information?\n\nMake your revisions directly on the tracker in the revision section.\n\n## Step 6: Submit Your Work\nUpload both your completed tracker and your final draft to the submission portal.\n\n## Assessment\nYour micro-essay will be evaluated on:\n- Completion of all steps in the writing process\n- Thoughtfulness of brainstorming\n- Quality of your draft\n- Evidence of meaningful revision\n- Adherence to the 150-word guideline\n\nThis activity demonstrates how even brief writing benefits from a structured approach of planning, drafting, and revising.",
