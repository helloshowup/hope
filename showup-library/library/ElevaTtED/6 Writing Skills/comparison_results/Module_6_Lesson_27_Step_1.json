Providing effective peer feedback is a crucial skill that fosters community and presence in our online learning environment. This exercise will help you practice evaluating and improving feedback comments.\n\n## Activity 1: Rate the Sample Comment\n\nBelow is a sample comment left by a peer on another student's discussion post about their career goals. Read it carefully and rate its effectiveness on a scale of 1-5 (1 being poor, 5 being excellent).\n\n> \"I read your post. Good job. I want to be a doctor too someday. My uncle is a doctor and he makes a lot of money. You should look into scholarships.\"\n\n**Take a moment to consider:**\n- Does this feedback acknowledge specific points from the original post?\n- Is it constructive and helpful?\n- Does it foster meaningful conversation?\n- Is it personalized to the recipient?\n\n## Activity 2: Rewrite the Poor Feedback\n\nNow, let's improve the feedback comment above. Rewrite it to make it more effective, specific, and engaging. Consider including:\n- A specific reference to the original post\n- Thoughtful questions that extend the conversation\n- Constructive suggestions related to the content\n- A personal connection that adds value\n\nWrite your improved version in your notes before proceeding.\n\n## Expert Version & Rationale\n\nHere's how an expert might rewrite the feedback:\n\n> \"Hi Maria, I was inspired by your post about pursuing a career in pediatric medicine! Your passion really came through when you described your volunteer experience at Children's Hospital. Have you considered joining the Pre-Med Club that you mentioned is available at your local community college? That could provide valuable networking opportunities. My cousin followed a similar path and found that shadowing a doctor during her undergraduate studies helped confirm her career choice. What specific area of pediatrics interests you most?\"\n\n**Expert Rationale:**\n1. **Personalization**: Uses the recipient's name and references specific details from their original post.\n2. **Engagement**: Asks thoughtful questions that invite further discussion.\n3. **Value-Adding**: Provides relevant suggestions and shares a related personal experience.\n4. **Tone**: Maintains a supportive and encouraging tone throughout.\n5. **Specificity**: Addresses particular elements rather than making generic comments.\n\n## Reflection\n\nConsider the differences between the original feedback and the expert version. The improved feedback creates a stronger sense of presence and community by:\n- Acknowledging the individual behind the post\n- Demonstrating careful reading and consideration\n- Providing actionable suggestions\n- Creating opportunities for continued dialogue\n\nRemember, effective feedback is a skill that improves with practice. By providing thoughtful, specific comments to your peers, you contribute to a richer learning community for everyone at Excel High School.",
