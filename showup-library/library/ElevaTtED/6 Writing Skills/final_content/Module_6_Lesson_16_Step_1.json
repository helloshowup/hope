  "final_content": "# Avoiding Common Errors\u2014\"I Do\"\n\n## Panel 1: Punctuation Basics\nPunctuation marks are essential road signs for your readers. Here are the most common errors to avoid:\n\n* **Comma Splices**: Don't join two complete sentences with only a comma.\n  * \u274c I finished my homework, I went to bed.\n  * \u2713 I finished my homework, and I went to bed.\n  * \u2713 I finished my homework. I went to bed.\n  * \u2713 I finished my homework; I went to bed.\n\n* **Apostrophes**: Use for possession or contractions, not plurals.\n  * \u274c The student's were learning.\n  * \u2713 The students were learning.\n  * \u274c I bought three book's.\n  * \u2713 I bought three books.\n\n## Panel 2: Subject-Verb Agreement\nSubjects and verbs must agree in number (singular/plural):\n\n* **Singular subjects** take singular verbs:\n  * \u2713 The student works hard.\n  * \u2713 Each of the assignments requires careful attention.\n  \n* **Plural subjects** take plural verbs:\n  * \u2713 The students work hard.\n  * \u2713 Many of the questions involve critical thinking.\n  \n* Watch for subjects separated from verbs:\n  * \u274c The list of items are on the desk.\n  * \u2713 The list of items is on the desk.\n  * \u274c One of the students were absent.\n  * \u2713 One of the students was absent.\n\n## Panel 3: Eliminating Wordiness\nClear writing is concise writing:\n\n* **Remove redundancies**:\n  * \u274c We arrived at 8:00 AM in the morning.\n  * \u2713 We arrived at 8:00 AM.\n  * \u274c Please RSVP back to me.\n  * \u2713 Please RSVP to me.\n\n* **Replace phrases with single words**:\n  * \u274c Due to the fact that I was late...\n  * \u2713 Because I was late...\n  * \u274c In the event that you cannot attend...\n  * \u2713 If you cannot attend...\n\n* **Eliminate empty modifiers**:\n  * \u274c This assignment is really very important.\n  * \u2713 This assignment is important.\n  * \u274c The basically fundamental concept is actually quite simple.\n  * \u2713 The fundamental concept is simple.\n\n## Practice Opportunity\nTry identifying and correcting errors in these sentences:\n1. The group of students were excited about the field trip.\n2. My brother and me went to the store.\n3.
