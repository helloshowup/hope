  "final_content": "# Process Snapshot: Writing Assessment System\n\nThe writing process at Excel High School is evaluated through our automated system that provides immediate feedback on your work. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Rubric Assessment**: The system checks your:\n   - **Brainstorming notes**: How thoroughly you explore ideas and their relevance to your topic\n   - **Initial draft**: Organization, structure, and content development\n   - **Revision process**: Quality of your self-assessment and how effectively you apply changes\n\n2. **Automated Grading**: Your submission receives an instant score based on how well you've demonstrated each step of the writing process. This allows you to:\n   - See your strengths and areas for improvement\n   - Understand which writing skills need more development\n   - Track your progress over time\n\n3. **Achievement Recognition**: When you score 80% or higher, you'll automatically unlock a Writing Process Badge in your student profile, which:\n   - Documents your writing skill development\n   - Builds your digital portfolio of achievements\n   - Motivates continued growth in your writing practice\n\nThis assessment approach ensures you're mastering the complete writing cycle: brainstorming ideas, creating drafts, making meaningful revisions, and finalizing your work.\n\n**Remember**: The focus is on your process, not just the final product! This approach helps develop lifelong writing skills that transfer to academic and professional settings.",
