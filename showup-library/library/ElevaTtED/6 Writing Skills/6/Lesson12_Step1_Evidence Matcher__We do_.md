# Evidence Matcher—“We do”

# Evidence Matcher—"We do"

## Introduction
Welcome to our interactive Evidence Matcher activity! In this exercise, we'll work together to match claims with appropriate evidence. This skill is essential for developing strong, well-supported writing in both academic and professional contexts.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, you will:
- Identify relevant evidence that supports specific claims
- Distinguish between strong and weak evidence connections
- Practice a critical skill for argumentative and research-based writing

## Activity Instructions
You will see 5 claims and 8 evidence snippets on your screen. Your task is to match each claim with the most appropriate evidence. Some claims may have more than one piece of evidence that supports them, while some evidence snippets may not match any claims.

### Claims
1. Social media use can negatively impact teenagers' mental health.
2. Regular exercise improves academic performance.
3. School uniforms help create a more focused learning environment.
4. Reading fiction increases empathy in readers.
5. Homework should be limited for elementary school students.

### Evidence Snippets
A. A 2019 study found that students who exercised for 30 minutes before tests scored 15% higher than those who didn't.
B. According to research, children ages 6-10 show diminishing returns on academic benefit after 30 minutes of homework.
C. A survey of 1,500 teens showed that those who spent more than 3 hours daily on social platforms reported 40% higher rates of anxiety.
D. Brain scans reveal increased activity in empathy-related neural networks after participants read character-driven stories.
E. In schools that adopted uniforms, teachers reported 30% fewer classroom disruptions.
F. Students who read novels regularly scored higher on social perception tests than non-readers.
G. A longitudinal study found that students who exercised regularly had better attendance and graduation rates.
H. Parents report spending less on clothing in schools with uniform policies.

## How It Works
1. Click and drag each evidence snippet to match it with the appropriate claim.
2. If you make two incorrect matches for any claim, a hint will appear to guide you.
3. Once you've completed all matches, explanations for the correct pairings will be revealed.
4. You can retry the activity as many times as needed to master this skill.

## Time Management Tip
This activity should take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. If you're spending more time, don't worry! Take breaks as needed and remember that developing critical thinking skills is worth the effort.

## Hints (Appear after two incorrect attempts)
- For Claim 1: Look for evidence related to psychological effects of technology use.
- For Claim 2: Consider evidence showing connections between physical activity and school performance.
- For Claim 3: Focus on evidence about classroom behavior and practical benefits.
- For Claim 4: Look for evidence related to social-emotional impacts of reading.
- For Claim 5: Consider evidence about effectiveness related to student age.

## Explanation of Correct Matches (Revealed upon completion)
- Claim 1 matches Evidence C: The survey data provides statistical evidence linking social media use to anxiety.
- Claim 2 matches Evidence A and G: Both snippets provide different aspects of how exercise benefits academic outcomes.
- Claim 3 matches Evidence E and H: These provide evidence on both behavioral impacts and practical benefits of uniforms.
- Claim 4 matches Evidence D and F: These snippets provide both neurological and performance-based evidence for fiction's impact on empathy.
- Claim 5 matches Evidence B: This research directly addresses the diminishing returns of homework for younger students.

## Why This Matters
In both academic and real-world contexts, the ability to match claims with appropriate evidence is crucial for:
- Writing persuasive essays and research papers
- Making effective arguments in discussions and debates
- Evaluating the credibility of information you encounter online and in media
- Developing critical thinking skills that apply across all subjects

Remember, strong writing requires not just making claims, but supporting them with relevant, specific evidence. This activity helps you practice identifying which evidence best supports different types of claims.

## Next Steps
After completing this activity, try creating your own claim-evidence matches on a topic that interests you. This will reinforce your learning and help you apply these skills to your own writing projects.
