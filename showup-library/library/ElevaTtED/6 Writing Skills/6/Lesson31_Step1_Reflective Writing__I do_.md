# Reflective Writing—“I do”

# Reflective Writing—"I do"

## Understanding Reflection

Reflection is the process of thinking deeply about our experiences, analyzing what happened, how we felt, what we learned, and how we might apply these insights in the future. In writing, reflection involves examining your own writing process, decisions, and outcomes to improve your skills. Reflective writing helps you become more self-aware as a writer and develop strategies for growth.

When you engage in reflective writing, you're essentially having a conversation with yourself about your experiences, thoughts, and learning. This process transforms passive experiences into active learning opportunities.

## The Gibbs Reflective Cycle

The Gibbs Reflective Cycle (1988) provides a structured framework for reflection that can guide your reflective writing process. It consists of six stages:

1. **Description**: What happened? Describe the experience objectively.
2. **Feelings**: What were you thinking and feeling during the experience?
3. **Evaluation**: What was good and challenging about the experience?
4. **Analysis**: What sense can you make of the situation? Why did things happen the way they did?
5. **Conclusion**: What else could you have done? What did you learn?
6. **Action Plan**: If the situation arose again, what would you do differently?

This cycle helps ensure your reflection is comprehensive and leads to actionable insights rather than just surface-level observations.

## Example Reflection Paragraph

Here's an example of reflective writing using the Gibbs cycle framework:

> When writing my narrative essay last week, I struggled with creating an engaging introduction **(Description)**. I felt frustrated and worried that readers wouldn't connect with my story **(Feelings)**. The strength of my essay was the vivid descriptions I included, but the beginning felt flat and generic **(Evaluation)**. I realize now that I rushed the introduction because I was eager to get to the main events of my story, and I didn't consider my audience's need to be drawn in from the start **(Analysis)**. I've learned that spending more time crafting an attention-grabbing opening is crucial for engaging readers **(Conclusion)**. For my next writing assignment, I'll draft multiple versions of my introduction, perhaps starting with a compelling question or surprising statement, and I'll ask a peer to provide feedback on which version is most engaging before finalizing my essay **(Action Plan)**.

**Try It Yourself:** Think about a recent writing assignment you completed. Using the example above as a guide, write a short reflection paragraph that includes all six elements of the Gibbs Reflective Cycle. Remember to be specific about your experience and what you learned.

## Practical Tips for Effective Reflective Writing

1. **Be honest** - Authentic reflection requires acknowledging both strengths and areas for improvement.

2. **Be specific** - Include concrete details and examples rather than vague generalizations.
   * ✓ "I spent 20 minutes revising my thesis statement three times"
   * ✗ "I worked on my paper for a while"

3. **Ask yourself probing questions** - Challenge yourself with "why" and "how" questions to dig deeper.
   * "Why did I struggle with this particular section?"
   * "How did my approach affect the outcome?"

4. **Balance description with analysis** - Don't just recount what happened; explore why it matters.

5. **Consider multiple perspectives** - How might others view the same situation differently?

6. **Connect to broader contexts** - Link your personal experience to wider principles, theories, or patterns.

7. **Focus on learning and growth** - Emphasize what you've learned and how you'll apply these insights.

8. **Set aside regular time** - Schedule reflection sessions after completing writing assignments while the experience is still fresh.

9. **Use "I" statements** - Own your thoughts, feelings, and actions using first-person perspective.

10. **Create a reflection journal** - Maintain a dedicated space for your reflective writing practice.

## Quick Check

Before moving on, ask yourself:
- Can I identify all six stages of the Gibbs Reflective Cycle?
- Do I understand how to apply this framework to my own writing experiences?
- Am I ready to practice reflective writing using these guidelines?

By incorporating reflective writing into your regular practice, you'll develop greater self-awareness as a writer and accelerate your growth and improvement over time.
