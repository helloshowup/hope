"struggle with writing because they don't understand the basic rules of grammar and punctuation."
</details>

### Error 2: "its important to proofread your work carefully"

</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Correction</summary>
"it's important to proofread your work carefully"
</details>

### Error 3: "good writing take time and practice"

<summary>Identify the error</summary>
Subject-verb agreement error: "writing" (singular) doesn't match with "take" (plural verb form).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Grammar rule</summary>
A singular subject requires a singular verb form.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Correction</summary>
"good writing takes time and practice"
</details>

### Error 4: "you should read you're work out loud"

</details>

## Try It Yourself

Now, try to find and correct the errors in this sentence:

**The students in my class** [turned in they're assignments but the teacher haven't graded them yet]{.practice1}

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Corrected sentence: "The students in my class turned in their assignments, but the teacher hasn't graded them yet."

Errors fixed:
1. "they're" → "their" (possessive form needed)
2. Missing comma before the coordinating conjunction "but"
3. "haven't" → "hasn't" (subject-verb agreement with singular "teacher")
</details>

## Reflection Questions

1. Which error do you find yourself making most frequently in your own writing?
2. How might reading your work aloud help you catch errors?
3. Why is it important to understand grammar rules rather than just memorizing corrections?
4. What strategy will you use to proofread your next writing assignment?

## Key Takeaways
- Proofreading is an essential step in the writing process
- Common errors include punctuation mistakes, incorrect word usage, and subject-verb agreement issues
- Reading your work aloud can help you catch errors you might miss when reading silently
- Understanding grammar rules helps you become a more confident writer

## Conclusion

Identifying and correcting errors is an essential skill for all writers. By practicing this skill regularly, you'll become more confident in your writing and produce clearer, more effective communication.
