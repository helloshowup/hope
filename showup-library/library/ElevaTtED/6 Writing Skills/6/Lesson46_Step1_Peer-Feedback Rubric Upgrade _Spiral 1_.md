# Peer-Feedback Rubric Upgrade (Spiral 1)

# Peer-Feedback Rubric Upgrade (Spiral 1)

## Learning Objective
By the end of this activity, you will create an enhanced peer-feedback rubric that fosters community engagement and provides clear evaluation criteria for your peers.

## Activity Overview
Effective peer feedback helps build our learning community while developing your critical thinking skills. In this activity, you'll design a comprehensive rubric that will help both you and your classmates provide more meaningful feedback.

## Activity Instructions

### Step 1: Design Your Enhanced Rubric
Create a new peer-feedback rubric that includes these four essential criteria:
* Content Quality
* Organization/Structure
* Presentation/Style
* Critical Thinking

### Step 2: Add Bullet Descriptors
For each criterion, develop 3-4 bullet point descriptors that clearly explain what excellence looks like. For example:

**Content Quality:**
* Presents accurate, relevant information
* Supports claims with specific evidence
* Demonstrates thorough understanding of the topic
* Shows depth of analysis beyond surface-level observations

### Step 3: Create a Visual Representation
Transform your rubric into a visually appealing format using one of these options:
* Create an infographic using a tool like Canva, Piktochart, or Google Drawings
* Design a color-coded table or chart in Google Docs or Word
* Develop a simple but effective visual layout that works for you

Your design should be:
* Clear and easily readable
* Visually organized with logical grouping
* Professional in appearance
* Accessible (consider color contrast, font size, etc.)

### Step 4: Share Your Creation
Post your completed rubric in the course forum with:
1. Your visual rubric file
2. A brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of how your enhanced rubric will improve peer feedback quality
3. One question you'd like feedback on regarding your rubric design

### Tips for Success
* Focus on creating descriptors that are specific and actionable
* Consider what would be most helpful for YOU when receiving feedback
* Remember that visual design should enhance understanding, not distract from content
* If you're struggling with design tools, prioritize clarity over visual complexity

### Submission Timeline
* Initial post due: [INSERT SPECIFIC DATE]
* Peer responses due: [INSERT SPECIFIC DATE]

Remember: An effective rubric provides specific, actionable criteria that helps both the reviewer provide targeted feedback and the recipient understand areas for improvement.
