# Feedback Simulation—“We do”

# Feedback Simulation: Interactive Training

## Introduction
Welcome to our interactive feedback training session! Providing effective peer feedback is a crucial skill that fosters community and presence in our online learning environment at Excel High School. This exercise will help you practice evaluating and improving feedback comments to better connect with your peers.

## Activity 1: Rate the Sample Comment

Below is a sample comment left by a peer on another student's discussion post about their career goals. Read it carefully and rate its effectiveness on a scale of 1-5 (1 being poor, 5 being excellent).

> "I read your post. Good job. I want to be a doctor too someday. My uncle is a doctor and he makes a lot of money. You should look into scholarships."

**Take a moment to consider:**
- Does this feedback acknowledge specific points from the original post?
- Is it constructive and helpful?
- Does it foster meaningful conversation?
- Is it personalized to the recipient?

**Quick Tip:** Effective feedback demonstrates that you've carefully read and considered your peer's work.

## Activity 2: Rewrite the Poor Feedback

Now, let's improve the feedback comment above. Rewrite it to make it more effective, specific, and engaging. Consider including:
- A specific reference to the original post
- Thoughtful questions that extend the conversation
- Constructive suggestions related to the content
- A personal connection that adds value

Write your improved version in your notes before proceeding. Remember, you can always return to this exercise for practice as you progress through your courses.

## Expert Version & Rationale

Here's how an expert might rewrite the feedback:

> "Hi Maria, I was inspired by your post about pursuing a career in pediatric medicine! Your passion really came through when you described your volunteer experience at Children's Hospital. Have you considered joining the Pre-Med Club that you mentioned is available at your local community college? That could provide valuable networking opportunities. My cousin followed a similar path and found that shadowing a doctor during her undergraduate studies helped confirm her career choice. What specific area of pediatrics interests you most?"

**Expert Rationale:**
1. **Personalization**: Uses the recipient's name and references specific details from their original post.
2. **Engagement**: Asks thoughtful questions that invite further discussion.
3. **Value-Adding**: Provides relevant suggestions and shares a related personal experience.
4. **Tone**: Maintains a supportive and encouraging tone throughout.
5. **Specificity**: Addresses particular elements rather than making generic comments.

## Reflection

Consider the differences between the original feedback and the expert version. The improved feedback creates a stronger sense of presence and community by:
- Acknowledging the individual behind the post
- Demonstrating careful reading and consideration
- Providing actionable suggestions
- Creating opportunities for continued dialogue

**Application Tip:** Try using this feedback framework in your next discussion response. You might find it helpful to save these guidelines for reference.

## Your Turn

As you continue your courses at Excel High School, remember that effective feedback is a skill that improves with practice. By providing thoughtful, specific comments to your peers, you contribute to a richer learning community for everyone.

**Time Management Note:** Quality feedback doesn't always mean lengthy feedback. Even a concise response that includes specific references and thoughtful questions can be highly effective.
