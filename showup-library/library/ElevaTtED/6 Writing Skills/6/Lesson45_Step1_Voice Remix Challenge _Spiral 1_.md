# Voice Remix Challenge (Spiral 1)

# Voice Remix Challenge (Spiral 1)

## Overview
In this activity, you'll practice adapting your writing voice for different contexts by transforming the same message for two different platforms. This exercise helps you develop flexibility in your writing style while maintaining your authentic voiceâ€”a crucial skill for academic and professional success.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this challenge, you will:
- Identify key characteristics of different writing contexts
- Adapt your writing style while preserving core message content
- Apply appropriate tone and formatting for specific platforms
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different communication approaches

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your Original Message
Write a 100-word message about a topic of your choice. This could be:
- An announcement about a school event
- Information about a new policy
- A product or service description
- A community update

**Pro Tip:** Choose a topic relevant to your current interests or career goals to make this exercise more meaningful.

### Step 2: Create Two Versions
Transform your original message into:
1. A **professional business email** - formal, precise, and structured
   * Include appropriate greeting and closing
   * Use clear paragraphs and professional language
   * Maintain a respectful, direct tone

2. A **social media post** - conversational, engaging, and concise
   * Consider character limits and attention-grabbing elements
   * Incorporate appropriate hashtags or emojis if suitable
   * Use language that encourages engagement

### Step 3: Post Your Work
Share all three versions (original, email, and social media) in the class forum. Include a brief reflection (2-3 sentences) explaining the specific voice choices you made for each platform.

### Step 4: Peer Feedback
Comment on at least two classmates' posts, addressing:
- How effectively they adapted their voice for each platform
- Specific elements that worked well
- Constructive suggestions for improvement

## Success Criteria
- All versions clearly communicate the same core message
- Each version demonstrates appropriate voice for its platform
- Reflection shows thoughtful consideration of audience and purpose
- Peer feedback is specific, constructive, and respectful

## Time Management
- Estimated completion time: 45-60 minutes
- Suggested breakdown:
  * Planning: 10 minutes
  * Writing versions: 20-30 minutes
  * Reflection: 5-10 minutes
  * Peer feedback: 10 minutes

Remember: Your authentic voice can be adapted while still remaining true to your personal style! This skill will serve you well in both academic and professional settings.
