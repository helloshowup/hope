# Micro-Essay Draft

# Micro-Essay Draft: Writing Process Activity

## Overview
In this activity, you'll practice the essential steps of the writing process by creating a micro-essay. This brief writing exercise will help you develop skills in brainstorming, drafting, and revising - fundamental techniques that apply to all forms of writing.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, you will:
- Apply the key stages of the writing process
- Practice effective brainstorming techniques
- Develop skills in drafting and revising written work
- Create a focused, concise piece of writing

## Materials Needed
- The Micro-Essay Tracker document (downloadable below)
- Word processor or paper for drafting

## Step 1: Download the Tracker
Download the [Micro-Essay Tracker](https://excelhs.org/resources/micro-essay-tracker.pdf) document. This fillable form will help you organize your thoughts and track your progress through the writing process.

## Step 2: Choose Your Topic
Select a topic that interests you from the following options:
- A skill I recently learned
- My favorite place
- A person who inspires me
- A challenge I overcame
- A goal I'm working toward

**Pro Tip:** Choose a topic that feels meaningful to you - this will make the writing process more engaging and your essay more authentic.

Record your chosen topic on the tracker.

## Step 3: Brainstorm Ideas (15-20 minutes)
Create a bullet list of at least 5-7 points related to your topic. These can include:
- Key details you want to include
- Specific examples
- Personal connections
- Descriptive elements
- Main message or point

**Example Brainstorm:** For "A skill I recently learned"
- Learning to cook pasta from scratch
- Failed first attempt - dough too sticky
- YouTube videos that helped
- Satisfaction of eating something I made
- What I learned about patience
- How this connects to other learning experiences

List your ideas on your tracker in the brainstorming section.

## Step 4: Draft Your Micro-Essay (20-25 minutes)
Using your brainstorming points as a guide, write a first draft of your micro-essay. Your draft should:
- Be approximately 150 words
- Have a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Include specific details from your brainstorming
- Express your personal perspective

**Remember:** This is a first draft - focus on getting your ideas down rather than perfection.

Write your draft in the designated section of the tracker.

## Step 5: Revise Your Work (15-20 minutes)
After completing your draft, take time to revise it. Consider:
- **Clarity:** Are your ideas expressed clearly?
- **Organization:** Does the essay flow logically?
- **Word choice:** Could you use more precise or engaging language?
- **Details:** Have you included enough specific information?
- **Purpose:** Does your essay convey your main point effectively?

**Revision Strategy:** Read your draft aloud to yourself. This often helps identify awkward phrasing or areas that need improvement.

Make your revisions directly on the tracker in the revision section.

## Step 6: Submit Your Work
Upload both your completed tracker and your final draft to the submission portal.

## Assessment
Your micro-essay will be evaluated on:
- Completion of all steps in the writing process
- Thoughtfulness of brainstorming
- Quality of your draft
- Evidence of meaningful revision
- Adherence to the 150-word guideline
