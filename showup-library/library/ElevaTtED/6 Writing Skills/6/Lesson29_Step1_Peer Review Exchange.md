# Peer Review Exchange

# Peer Review Exchange

## Introduction
Welcome to the Peer Review Exchange process! This collaborative activity allows you to receive valuable feedback on your writing while developing your critical thinking and evaluation skills. Through this exchange, you'll gain new perspectives on your work and help others improve their writing as well.

## Process Overview

### Step 1: Download the Evaluation Rubric
Before beginning the peer review process, download the evaluation rubric from the "Course Materials" section. This rubric outlines the specific criteria you'll use to assess your peers' essays, including:
- Thesis clarity and development
- Evidence and supporting details
- Organization and structure
- Writing mechanics and style
- Overall effectiveness

Familiarize yourself with these criteria before proceeding to the next step.

### Step 2: Post Your Essay
Upload your completed essay to the designated forum thread by the specified deadline. Make sure your document:
- Is properly formatted (double-spaced, 12-point font)
- Includes your name and essay title
- Is saved as a PDF or Word document (.docx)
- Has page numbers

This ensures your work is ready for review by your classmates.

### Step 3: Review Two Peers' Essays
Select two classmates' essays to review. For each essay:
1. Add inline comments directly in the document using the commenting feature
   - Highlight specific strengths (e.g., "Strong thesis statement here")
   - Identify areas for improvement (e.g., "This paragraph could use more supporting evidence")
   - Ask clarifying questions (e.g., "How does this connect to your main argument?")
   
2. Complete the provided feedback form that includes:
   - Overall assessment based on the rubric criteria (using the 1-5 scale provided)
   - 2-3 specific strengths of the essay with examples
   - 2-3 constructive suggestions for improvement with specific recommendations
   - Encouraging closing remarks

### Step 4: Receive and Review Feedback
After the review period closes, you'll receive feedback from two of your peers. Take time to:
- Consider all comments thoughtfully
- Note patterns in the feedback
- Identify priority areas for revision
- Apply relevant suggestions to strengthen your essay

### Step 5: Reflection and Application
Complete a brief reflection (250-300 words) addressing:
- The most valuable feedback you received
- How you plan to implement changes based on peer suggestions
- What you learned about your writing through this process
- How reviewing others' work influenced your own writing approach

## Benefits of Peer Review
This exchange helps you:
- Develop critical reading and analysis skills
- Gain new perspectives on your writing
- Practice giving constructive feedback (a valuable professional skill)
- Build a supportive learning community
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in your own writing

## Tips for Effective Peer Review
- Be specific and provide examples
- Balance positive observations with constructive suggestions
- Focus on the writing, not the writer
- Suggest rather than direct ("You might consider..." rather than "You should...")
- Prioritize higher-order concerns (thesis, evidence, organization) before grammar and mechanics

Remember that the goal is mutual improvement. Your thoughtful feedback helps your peers just as their insights will help strengthen your writing.
