# Portfolio Showcase Prep (Spiral 1)

# Portfolio Showcase Prep (Spiral 1)

## Overview
In this first spiral of your Portfolio Showcase preparation, you'll select your best writing samples and create a brief presentation to share with your peers. This exercise helps you reflect on your writing journey and receive valuable feedback before your final showcase.

## Learning Objectives
- Curate a selection of your strongest writing pieces
- Develop a concise presentation of your work
- Practice receiving and responding to peer feedback
- Apply self-assessment skills to evaluate your writing progress

## Instructions

### Step 1: Select Your Three Best Pieces (Due: [specific date])
Review all the writing you've completed during this course. Choose the three pieces that:
- Best demonstrate your writing skills
- Show variety in style, purpose, or format
- Represent your growth as a writer

**Tip:** Consider pieces that demonstrate different strengths (creativity, research skills, persuasive techniques, etc.)

### Step 2: Develop Your 60-Second Pitch (Due: [specific date])
Create a brief script that:
- Introduces your selected pieces
- Explains why you chose each piece
- Highlights specific elements you're proud of
- Describes how these pieces demonstrate your writing abilities

Keep your script focused and conciseâ€”you only have 60 seconds!

**Accessibility Option:** If you prefer not to record video, you may create a slide presentation with audio narration or written notes.

### Step 3: Record Your Video Presentation (Due: [specific date])
Using your script as a guide:
- Record a 60-second video presenting your portfolio selections
- Speak clearly and with confidence
- Consider showing excerpts of your writing on screen if possible

**Technical Support:** Need help with recording? Visit the Student Success Center or message your Success Coach through your Student Portal.

### Step 4: Share and Engage (Due: [specific date])
- Post your video in the designated discussion area with the hashtag #ExcelWritersShowcase
- View at least three classmates' videos
- Provide constructive feedback using the "2 Stars and a Wish" format:
  * Two specific strengths you noticed
  * One suggestion for enhancement

## Assessment
Your participation will be evaluated based on:
- Thoughtfulness of your portfolio selection (30%)
- Quality and clarity of your presentation (30%)
- Engagement with peers' showcases (30%)
- Timeliness of submission (10%)

## Next Steps
After receiving feedback, you'll refine your selections and presentation for the final Portfolio Showcase in Spiral 2. This iterative process helps you develop your best possible writing portfolio.
