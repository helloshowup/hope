# Evidence-Enhanced Essay: Adding Research-Based Sources

## Introduction
Strengthening your essays with research-based evidence transforms your writing from personal opinion to scholarly work. This lesson guides you through adding at least two research-based sources to an existing essay, integrating them smoothly, and citing them properly using MLA format.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify appropriate places in your writing for research evidence
- Select credible, academic sources to support your arguments
- Integrate source material using effective techniques
- Properly cite sources using MLA format

## Why Evidence Matters
Research-based evidence:
- Builds credibility for your arguments
- Demonstrates your understanding of the topic
- Connects your ideas to scholarly conversations
- Provides support that readers find convincing

## Finding Quality Research Sources
Strong research-based sources include:
- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Books from academic publishers
- Government publications
- Reports from established organizations
- Articles from reputable news sources

**Pro Tip:** Excel High School students have access to our online library databases where you can find high-quality sources. Check the Resources tab in your Student Portal.

Avoid using sources like personal blogs, Wikipedia, or social media posts as your primary evidence. (Note: Wikipedia can be a good starting point to find more reliable sources in their references section.)

## Integrating Sources Smoothly
When adding sources to your essay, aim for seamless integration using these techniques:

1. **Signal phrases**: Introduce your source before the evidence.
   - According to Johnson, "..."
   - Research by Smith indicates that "..."
   - In her comprehensive study, Rodriguez argues, "..."

2. **Paraphrasing**: Restate the author's ideas in your own words while maintaining the original meaning.
   - **Original text:** "The data indicates a 45% increase in renewable energy adoption across rural communities between 2018-2022."
   - **Paraphrased:** Smith's research reveals that rural areas have seen renewable energy use nearly double over a four-year period (42).

3. **Direct quotations**: Use the exact words from your source (with quotation marks) when the specific language is important.

4. **Block quotations**: For quotes longer than four lines, indent the entire passage.

## MLA Citation Format
For in-text citations:
- Include the author's last name and page number: (Johnson 42)
- If no author is available, use a shortened title: ("Climate Change" 12)

For Works Cited entries:
```
Book format:
Author's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Year of Publication.

Journal article format:
Author's Last Name, First Name. "Title of Article." Title of Journal, Volume, Issue, Year, Pages.

Website format:
Author's Last Name, First Name. "Title of Page." Website Name, Publisher, Date of publication, URL.
```

## Your Assignment
1. Select an essay you've previously written
2. Identify at least two places where research evidence would strengthen your argument
3. Find at least two credible, research-based sources relevant to your topic
4. Integrate these sources into your essay using the techniques discussed
5. Add proper MLA citations (both in-text and in a Works Cited page)
6. **Highlight all new additions** in your submission so your instructor can clearly see where you've enhanced your essay

## Example of Enhanced Paragraph

**Original paragraph:**
Social media affects teenagers' mental health. Many teens report feeling anxious when they can't check their accounts.

**Enhanced paragraph with evidence (highlighted):**
Social media significantly impacts teenagers' mental health. **According to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, adolescents who spend more than three hours daily on social media platforms have a 35% higher risk of developing anxiety symptoms compared to those with limited usage (Moreno and Garcia 42).** Many teens report feeling anxious when they can't check their accounts, **a phenomenon researchers have termed "social media anxiety disorder," which affects approximately 27% of teenagers ages 13-17 (Patel 156).**
