# Giving & Receiving Feedback—“I do”

# Giving & Receiving Feedback—"I do"

## Why Feedback Matters

Feedback is essential to the writing process. As writers, we often become too close to our own work to see its strengths and weaknesses clearly. Peer feedback provides fresh perspectives that can transform good writing into great writing.

Here's why feedback matters:

1. **Growth opportunity**: Thoughtful feedback highlights areas for improvement that you might not have noticed.
2. **Skill development**: Both giving and receiving feedback develops critical thinking and analytical skills.
3. **Community building**: The exchange of feedback creates a supportive learning community.
4. **Perspective expansion**: Others may interpret your writing in ways you didn't anticipate.
5. **Professional preparation**: Learning to process feedback constructively is valuable in academic and professional settings.

Remember, feedback is not criticism—it's a collaborative tool that helps all writers improve. When we approach feedback with openness and a growth mindset, it becomes a powerful catalyst for development.

## Framing Constructive Comments

The way feedback is framed dramatically affects how it's received. Constructive feedback should be specific, actionable, and balanced. Here are key strategies:

### The Feedback Sandwich Method
- Begin with a positive observation
- Address areas for improvement
- End with encouragement or another positive comment

### Use "I" Statements
Instead of: "You didn't explain this concept clearly."
Try: "I found myself confused about this concept and would benefit from more explanation."

### Be Specific and Actionable
Instead of: "This paragraph is weak."
Try: "This paragraph could be strengthened by adding a specific example to illustrate your point."

### Focus on the Writing, Not the Writer
Instead of: "You're not good at organizing your thoughts."
Try: "The organization of ideas in this section could be more logical if the main point came first."

### Ask Questions
Questions invite the writer to think deeper: "What did you mean when you wrote...?" or "Have you considered including...?"

## Example Annotated Paragraph Walkthrough

Let's examine how effective feedback looks in practice. Below is a sample paragraph followed by constructive comments:

**Original Paragraph:**
*Technology impacts society in many ways. It changes how we communicate. Some people think technology is bad. Others think it's good. People use technology every day. It affects education too.*

**Annotated Feedback:**
1. **Strength**: ✓ *You've chosen an important and relevant topic that affects everyone.*

2. **Structure**: △ *The paragraph consists of short, disconnected sentences. Consider using transitions between ideas to create better flow. For example: "Technology impacts society in many ways, particularly in how we communicate."*

3. **Development**: △ *The statement "Some people think technology is bad. Others think it's good" is very general. I'd like to see specific examples of both positive and negative impacts.*

4. **Focus**: ? *The paragraph touches on several aspects of technology's impact but doesn't develop any of them fully. Which specific aspect of technology's impact are you most interested in exploring?*

5. **Closing thought**: ✓ *Mentioning education is relevant, but this could be expanded to serve as a focused direction for the paragraph.*

6. **Suggestion for revision**: *Consider narrowing your focus to one aspect of technology's impact (perhaps education) and developing that idea with specific examples and deeper analysis.*

This feedback identifies strengths, offers specific suggestions for improvement, asks a guiding question, and provides a concrete recommendation for revision—all while maintaining a respectful, constructive tone.

## Your Turn to Practice

Now that you've seen how effective feedback works, try applying these principles in your own peer reviews. Remember to:

1. Start with something positive and specific
2. Use "I" statements to frame suggestions
3. Ask thoughtful questions that promote deeper thinking
4. Provide actionable recommendations
5. End on an encouraging note

The feedback skills you develop here will serve you well beyond this course—in future classes, professional settings, and collaborative projects throughout your academic and career journey.

## Reflection Checkpoint

Before moving on, take a moment to consider:
- Which feedback strategy do you think will be most helpful to implement in your own peer reviews?
- What type of feedback would be most valuable for you to receive on your own writing?
- How might you apply these feedback principles to other areas of your academic work?
