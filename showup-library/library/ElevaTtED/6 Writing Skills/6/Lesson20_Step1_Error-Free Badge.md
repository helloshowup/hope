# Error-Free Badge: Proofreading Achievement

## What Is the Error-Free Badge?

The Error-Free Badge is a recognition of your proofreading skills. After you submit your writing draft, our system will analyze it for common writing errors. If your work contains fewer than three uncorrected errors, you'll earn the Error-Free Badge!

## How It Works:

1. Submit your completed draft
2. The system analyzes your work for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other writing errors
3. If fewer than three uncorrected errors remain, you'll receive the Error-Free Badge
4. The badge will appear in your student portfolio and course progress dashboard
5. The system will suggest your next focus area for writing improvement

## Why It Matters:

* Demonstrates your attention to detail and proofreading skills
* Builds confidence in your writing abilities
* Develops a valuable skill for academic and professional success
* Helps you track your progress as you improve your writing

## Tips for Success:
