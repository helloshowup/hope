## Understanding the Auto-Checker Evaluation

When you submit your essay, our auto-checker will evaluate three key structural elements:

1. **Thesis Clarity**: Your thesis statement must clearly present your main argument and appear in your introduction paragraph.

2. **Paragraph Unity**: Each body paragraph must focus on a single main idea that supports your thesis, with appropriate transitions between paragraphs to guide your reader.

3. **Conclusion Strength**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a new way that reinforces your argument.

## Passing Requirements

To pass the structure assessment, your essay must have **no more than 2 issues** across these three categories. 

**Example:** If your thesis is somewhat unclear (1 issue) and one paragraph lacks unity (1 issue), but your conclusion is strong, you would still pass with 2 total issues.

## Success Tips

Before submitting your essay, use this checklist:
- Is my thesis statement clearly stated in my introduction?
- Does each paragraph focus on one main idea with supporting details?
- Have I included transitions between paragraphs?
- Does my conclusion summarize my key points and restate my thesis in a fresh way?
