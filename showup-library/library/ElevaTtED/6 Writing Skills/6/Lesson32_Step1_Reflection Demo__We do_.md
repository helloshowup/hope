**Sample Reflection Log: Personal Narrative Assignment**

[**Today I spent about 45 minutes working on my personal narrative.**]{.hotspot1} I found it [**challenging to start my introduction**]{.hotspot2} because I wasn't sure which details would grab the reader's attention. Once I got past the introduction, [**the writing flowed more naturally**]{.hotspot3} as I described my camping trip experience.

[**I'm proud of the sensory details I included**]{.hotspot4} about the smell of pine trees and the sound of the creek. I think these details make my narrative more engaging. However, I still need to work on [**creating a stronger conclusion**]{.hotspot5} that ties everything together.

[**For my next writing session, I plan to revise my conclusion**]{.hotspot6} and add more dialogue between my family members to make the story more dynamic.
