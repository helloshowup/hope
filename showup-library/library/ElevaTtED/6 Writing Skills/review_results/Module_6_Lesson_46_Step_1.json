  "reviewed_content": "# Peer-Feedback Rubric Upgrade (Spiral 1)\n\n## Learning Objective\nBy the end of this activity, you will create an enhanced peer-feedback rubric that fosters community engagement and provides clear evaluation criteria for your peers.\n\n## Activity Overview\nEffective peer feedback helps build our learning community while developing your critical thinking skills. In this activity, you'll design a comprehensive rubric that will help both you and your classmates provide more meaningful feedback.\n\n## Activity Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Design Your Enhanced Rubric\nCreate a new peer-feedback rubric that includes these four essential criteria:\n* Content Quality\n* Organization/Structure\n* Presentation/Style\n* Critical Thinking\n\n### Step 2: Add Bullet Descriptors\nFor each criterion, develop 3-4 bullet point descriptors that clearly explain what excellence looks like. For example:\n\n**Content Quality:**\n* Presents accurate, relevant information\n* Supports claims with specific evidence\n* Demonstrates thorough understanding of the topic\n* Shows depth of analysis beyond surface-level observations\n\n### Step 3: Create a Visual Representation\nTransform your rubric into a visually appealing format using one of these options:\n* Create an infographic using a tool like Canva, Piktochart, or Google Drawings\n* Design a color-coded table or chart in Google Docs or Word\n* Develop a simple but effective visual layout that works for you\n\nYour design should be:\n* Clear and easily readable\n* Visually organized with logical grouping\n* Professional in appearance\n* Accessible (consider color contrast, font size, etc.)\n\n### Step 4: Share Your Creation\nPost your completed rubric in the course forum with:\n1. Your visual rubric file\n2. A brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of how your enhanced rubric will improve peer feedback quality\n3. One question you'd like feedback on regarding your rubric design\n\n### Tips for Success\n* Focus on creating descriptors that are specific and actionable\n* Consider what would be most helpful for YOU when receiving feedback\n* Remember that visual design should enhance understanding, not distract from content\n* If you're struggling with design tools, prioritize clarity over visual complexity\n\n### Submission Timeline\n* Initial post due: [INSERT SPECIFIC DATE]\n* Peer responses due: [INSERT SPECIFIC DATE]\n\nRemember: An effective rubric provides specific, actionable criteria that helps both the reviewer provide targeted feedback and the recipient understand areas for improvement.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and accessibility:\n\n1. Added an \"Activity Overview\" section to provide context and purpose\n2. Expanded Step 3 to offer multiple options for creating the visual representation, not just requiring an infographic\n3. Added accessibility considerations to the design requirements\n4. Enhanced Step 4 with more specific instructions for forum posting, including a prompt to ask a question that encourages peer engagement\n5. Added a \"Tips for Success\" section to provide additional guidance and support\n6. Included a \"Submission Timeline\" section with placeholders for specific dates\n7. Improved overall formatting and organization to make instructions more scannable\n8. Maintained the original learning objective and core requirements while making the activity more flexible and accessible for diverse learners\n\nThese changes address the needs of various learner segments in the profile, particularly supporting \"Second-Chance Learners\" who need scaffolding, Adult Diploma Seekers who need flexibility, and aligning with the UDL principles mentioned in the instructional design drivers."
