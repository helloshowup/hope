This brief writing exercise will help you develop skills in brainstorming, drafting, and revising - fundamental techniques that apply to all forms of writing.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy completing this activity, you will:\n- Apply the key stages of the writing process\n- Practice effective brainstorming techniques\n- Develop skills in drafting and revising written work\n- Create a focused, concise piece of writing\n\n## Materials Needed\n- The Micro-Essay Tracker document (downloadable below)\n- Word processor or paper for drafting\n\n## Step 1: Download the Tracker\nDownload the [Micro-Essay Tracker](https://excelhs.org/resources/micro-essay-tracker.pdf) document. This fillable form will help you organize your thoughts and track your progress through the writing process.\n\n## Step 2: Choose Your Topic\nSelect a topic that interests you from the following options:\n- A skill I recently learned\n- My favorite place\n- A person who inspires me\n- A challenge I overcame\n- A goal I'm working toward\n\n**Pro Tip:** Choose a topic that feels meaningful to you - this will make the writing process more engaging and your essay more authentic.\n\nRecord your chosen topic on the tracker.\n\n## Step 3: Brainstorm Ideas (15-20 minutes)\nCreate a bullet list of at least 5-7 points related to your topic. These can include:\n- Key details you want to include\n- Specific examples\n- Personal connections\n- Descriptive elements\n- Main message or point\n\n**Example Brainstorm:** For \"A skill I recently learned\"\n- Learning to cook pasta from scratch\n- Failed first attempt - dough too sticky\n- YouTube videos that helped\n- Satisfaction of eating something I made\n- What I learned about patience\n- How this connects to other learning experiences\n\nList your ideas on your tracker in the brainstorming section.\n\n## Step 4: Draft Your Micro-Essay (20-25 minutes)\nUsing your brainstorming points as a guide, write a first draft of your micro-essay. Your draft should:\n- Be approximately 150 words\n- Have a clear beginning, middle, and end\n- Include specific details from your brainstorming\n- Express your personal perspective\n\n**Remember:** This is a first draft - focus on getting your ideas down rather than perfection.\n\nWrite your draft in the designated section of the tracker.\n\n## Step 5: Revise Your Work (15-20 minutes)\nAfter completing your draft, take time to revise it. Consider:\n- **Clarity:** Are your ideas expressed clearly?\n- **Organization:** Does the essay flow logically?\n- **Word choice:** Could you use more precise or engaging language?\n- **Details:** Have you included enough specific information?\n- **Purpose:** Does your essay convey your main point effectively?\n\n**Revision Strategy:** Read your draft aloud to yourself. This often helps identify awkward phrasing or areas that need improvement.\n\nMake your revisions directly on the tracker in the revision section.\n\n## Step 6: Submit Your Work\nUpload both your completed tracker and your final draft to the submission portal.\n\n## Assessment\nYour micro-essay will be evaluated on:\n- Completion of all steps in the writing process\n- Thoughtfulness of brainstorming\n- Quality of your draft\n- Evidence of meaningful revision\n- Adherence to the 150-word guideline\n\n## Need Help?\n- Use the BRYTE AI Tutor for real-time assistance with your writing\n- Visit the Writing Lab for additional support\n- Message your instructor with specific questions\n\nThis activity demonstrates how even brief writing benefits from a structured approach of planning, drafting, and revising - skills you'll use throughout your academic and professional life.",
