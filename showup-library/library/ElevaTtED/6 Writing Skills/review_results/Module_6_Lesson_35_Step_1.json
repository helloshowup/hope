  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational value for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Removed \"AI\" from the rubric title to avoid potential confusion or anxiety about automated grading\n2. Added more descriptive language to each criterion to help students better understand expectations\n3. Created a new \"Tips for Success\" section with practical guidance on meeting the requirements\n4. Added a \"Need Help?\" section that references Excel-specific resources (Success Coach, BRYTE AI Tutor)\n5. Included a concluding statement that emphasizes the broader value of reflection skills\n6. Enhanced formatting with more consistent structure and clearer section breaks\n7. Used more encouraging, supportive language throughout to build confidence\n\nThese changes make the content more aligned with Excel's UDL principles, provide better scaffolding for self-directed learning, and offer clearer guidance for all learner segments, particularly benefiting \"Second-Chance Learners\" who may need additional support and encouragement."
