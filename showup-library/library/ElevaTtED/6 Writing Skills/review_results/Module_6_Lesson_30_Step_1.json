  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the assignment for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Added a clear \"Purpose\" section to help students understand the value of reflection in their learning journey\n2. Expanded the instructions with more specific formatting guidelines\n3. Added \"Submission Guidelines\" to clarify expectations about length and format\n4. Included \"Success Tips\" to help students distinguish between superficial and meaningful reflection\n5. Improved overall organization with more consistent section headers\n6. Maintained the 100-word requirement but provided clearer guidance on quality expectations\n7. Enhanced formatting for better readability, especially for students who may need additional structure\n\nThese changes support Excel's competency-based approach while providing the scaffolding needed for diverse learner segments, particularly \"Second-Chance Learners\" and those who benefit from clear structure."
