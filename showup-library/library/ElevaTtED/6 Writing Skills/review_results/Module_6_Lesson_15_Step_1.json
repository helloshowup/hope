  "edit_summary": "I made several significant improvements to the Evidence Checklist:\n\n1. Added a clear structure with percentage weightings for each section to help students understand the evaluation criteria better.\n\n2. Expanded the criteria in each section from 2-3 items to 4 items, providing more specific guidance on what constitutes quality evidence.\n\n3. Added two new important categories:\n   - \"Analysis & Application\" section to emphasize that evidence needs interpretation\n   - More detailed \"Integration\" criteria combined with citation\n\n4. Improved the instructions by explicitly telling students to check boxes that apply.\n\n5. Added a more helpful \"Next Steps\" section with specific resources available at Excel High School (BRYTE AI Tutor, Writing Lab).\n\n6. Used more student-friendly language and added motivational content to encourage engagement.\n\n7. Improved formatting with better visual organization and clearer section headings.\n\nThese changes align with the target learner profile by providing clearer structure for self-pacing (Traditional Achievers), offering practical relevance (Adult Diploma Seekers), and incorporating scaffolding with clear feedback pathways (Key Instructional Design Drivers)."
