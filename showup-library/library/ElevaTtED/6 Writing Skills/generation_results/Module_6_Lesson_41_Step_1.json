Later in the discussion, comment thoughtfully on at least one peer's solution\n\n### The Stalled Paragraph\n\nRead the following paragraph that a student has been struggling with:\n\n*I think school uniforms are a topic that many people have opinions about. Some people think they're good and others think they're bad. There are points on both sides. Students might feel like their freedom is taken away. But some say it helps with focus. I'm not really sure which side I agree with more. It's complicated and there are many factors to consider when thinking about this issue.*\n\n### Your Task\n\nCreate a forum post that:\n- Identifies which stage of the writing process has failed (brainstorming, drafting, revising, or editing)\n- Explains your reasoning with specific evidence from the paragraph\n- Recommends at least 2-3 specific actions the writer should take next\n- Includes a thoughtful question to promote further discussion\n\nAfter several of your peers have posted, return to comment meaningfully on at least one other student's analysis, offering additional insights or respectfully suggesting alternative approaches.\n\nRemember to apply the writing process concepts we've been studying in class!\n</educational_content>",
