    "<educational_content>\n# Worked Example\u2014Draft-to-Polish \"We do\"\n\n## Introduction\nIn this lesson, we'll work together through the process of transforming a rough draft into a polished piece of writing. You'll see how to identify issues with ideas, clarity, cohesion, and grammar, and learn effective strategies for revision using AI assistance as a tool.\n\n## Starting Point: Rough Paragraph\nLet's begin with this rough paragraph:\n\n> *College is important for many reasons in todays world. First it helps you get better jobs. Also you learn alot of things that are useful. College graduates make more money than people who dont go to college. The experience is also good because you meet people. Some people say college costs too much money but its worth it in the long run because of all the benefits you get from having a degree which helps in many ways.*\n\n## Step 1: Highlighting Idea Issues\n\nLooking at our paragraph, we can identify several idea-related issues:\n- **Vague claims**: \"College is important for many reasons\" and \"learn alot of things\" lack specificity\n- **Undeveloped points**: The statement about meeting people doesn't explain why this matters\n- **Repetitive content**: The paragraph mentions benefits multiple times without depth\n- **Missing transitions**: Ideas jump from one to another without clear connections\n\n## Step 2: Using AI to Revise Ideas\n\nHere's a prompt we could use to address these idea issues:\n\n```\nRevise this paragraph to include more specific claims about the benefits of college education, develop each point with supporting details, eliminate repetition, and add clear transitions between ideas.\n```\n\n**Now it's your turn!** Before moving on, try writing your own revised version of the paragraph that addresses these idea issues.\n\n[Pause for learner attempt]\n\n## Suggested Revision for Ideas\n\n> *Higher education provides several concrete advantages in today's competitive world. First, a college degree significantly expands career opportunities, giving graduates access to positions that require specialized knowledge and skills. Additionally, college coursework develops critical thinking abilities and subject expertise that extend beyond the workplace into personal decision-making. Research consistently shows that college graduates earn substantially higher lifetime incomes compared to those with only high school diplomas\u2014approximately $1 million more over their careers. Beyond academic and financial benefits, the college experience fosters valuable social networks and professional connections that often last a lifetime. While the rising cost of tuition presents a legitimate concern, the long-term return on investment through increased earning potential and career advancement opportunities typically outweighs the initial financial burden.*\n\n## Continuing the Process\n\nNow we would repeat this process focusing on:\n\n1. **Clarity issues**: Identifying unclear sentences, jargon, or confusing phrasing\n2. **Cohesion problems**: Looking for disconnected ideas or missing logical flow\n3. **Grammar errors**: Finding and fixing punctuation, spelling, and sentence structure issues\n\nFor each area, we would:\n- Highlight specific issues\n- Create targeted AI prompts\n- Allow time for your revision attempt\n- Share a suggested solution\n\n## Resources\n\nDownload these helpful materials to support your revision process:\n- [Complete Lesson Transcript (PDF)](link-to-transcript)\n- [AI Revision Prompts List (PDF)](link-to-prompts)\n\nRemember, effective writing is a process that requires multiple revisions. The draft-to-polish approach helps you systematically improve your writing by addressing different aspects in sequence.\n</educational_content>",

You'll see how to identify issues with ideas, clarity, cohesion, and grammar, and learn how to use AI tools effectively to help with revisions.\n\n## Starting Draft\nLet's begin with this rough paragraph:\n\n> *College is important for many students today. It helps with jobs and learning stuff. Some people think its too expensive but others say worth it. You meet people and do activities there. Some degrees are better than other ones for getting hired. Online classes are a option now too.*\n\n## Step 1: Highlighting Idea Issues\n\nLooking at our draft, we can identify several idea-related problems:\n- **Vague statements**: \"helps with jobs and learning stuff\" lacks specificity\n- **Undeveloped thoughts**: The cost-benefit analysis is superficial\n- **Missing connections**: Ideas jump from topic to topic without clear transitions\n- **Lack of evidence**: Claims made without supporting details\n\n## Step 2: Creating an AI Prompt for Revision\n\nHere's a prompt we could use to help revise the paragraph:\n\n```\nRevise this paragraph to develop the ideas more thoroughly. Add specific benefits of college education, expand on the cost-benefit analysis, and create logical connections between ideas:\n\n[Original paragraph text]\n```\n\n**Now it's your turn!** Before moving on, try writing your own revised version of the paragraph based on the issues we identified.\n\n[Pause for learner attempt]\n\n## Suggested Revision for Ideas\n\nHere's how the paragraph might be improved:\n\n> *Higher education provides significant advantages for today's students, particularly in career preparation and intellectual development. College graduates typically earn higher salaries and experience lower unemployment rates than those with only high school diplomas. While the rising cost of tuition presents a legitimate concern, the long-term financial benefits often outweigh the initial investment. Beyond academics, college offers valuable opportunities for networking, personal growth, and extracurricular involvement. Some fields of study, particularly in STEM and healthcare, demonstrate stronger employment outcomes, though all degrees develop transferable skills valued by employers. Additionally, the expansion of online education has made college more accessible to students with various needs and circumstances.*\n\n## Continuing the Process\n\nWe would repeat this process for:\n\n1. **Clarity issues**: Identifying confusing sentences or unclear language\n2. **Cohesion problems**: Adding transitions and improving paragraph flow\n3. **Grammar errors**: Correcting punctuation, spelling, and sentence structure\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Downloadable Transcript**: [Click here to download a complete transcript of this lesson](link-to-transcript)\n- **AI Prompt List**: [Click here for a collection of useful revision prompts](link-to-prompts)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRemember that good writing rarely happens in a single draft. The draft-to-polish process requires careful analysis of your writing at multiple levels\u2014from big ideas down to grammar details. Using structured revision steps and thoughtful prompts helps ensure your final product communicates effectively with your audience.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Worked Example\u2014Draft-to-Polish \"We do\"\n\n## Introduction\nIn this guided practice, we'll walk through the process of taking a rough draft and polishing it into a more effective piece of writing. We'll use a step-by-step approach that mirrors what professional writers do: identify issues, create targeted revision strategies, and implement improvements. This \"we do\" exercise will provide scaffolding as you learn to refine your own writing.\n\n## Starting Point: Our Rough Paragraph\n\nLet's begin with this rough paragraph:\n\n> College students face many challenges today. They have to deal with stress. Financial problems are common. Time management is hard too. Some students work jobs while studying. Mental health issues can happen. Technology can be distracting. Students need support from their schools.\n\n## Step 1: Highlighting Idea Issues\n\nFirst, let's identify the conceptual problems with this paragraph:\n- **Lacks a clear main idea/topic sentence**\n- **Ideas are disconnected** - just a list of statements\n- **No development** of any single point\n- **Missing transitions** between ideas\n- **No conclusion** or takeaway\n\n## Step 2: Using AI to Help Revise\n\nHere's a prompt we could use to address these idea issues:\n\n```\nRevise this paragraph about college student challenges to include:\n1. A clear topic sentence that previews main points\n2. Logical organization of related ideas\n3. Transitions between ideas\n4. Supporting details for each challenge\n5. A concluding sentence that offers perspective\nKeep the same general content but improve structure and flow.\n```\n\n**Your Turn**: Before moving on, try creating your own revised version addressing these issues.\n\n## Suggested Revision (Ideas)\n\n> College students today face multiple interconnected challenges that impact their academic success and wellbeing. The most pressing issues include financial strain, as many students juggle part-time jobs with full course loads to manage rising tuition costs and living expenses. Related to this financial pressure is the difficulty of time management, where students must balance academic responsibilities with work, social activities, and self-care. Additionally, these stressors often contribute to mental health concerns, with increasing rates of anxiety and depression among college populations. While technology provides valuable educational tools, it can simultaneously present distractions that further complicate students' focus and productivity. Universities must recognize these interrelated challenges and develop comprehensive support systems that address students' academic, financial, and emotional needs.\n\n## Repeat Process for Clarity, Cohesion, and Grammar\n\nNow let's examine the revised paragraph for:\n- **Clarity issues**: Any confusing phrases or vague language\n- **Cohesion problems**: How well sentences flow together\n- **Grammar errors**: Technical writing issues\n\nAI prompt for this level of revision:\n\n```\nPolish this paragraph about college student challenges by:\n1. Simplifying complex sentences where needed\n2. Ensuring consistent tense and voice\n3. Removing unnecessary words\n4. Strengthening transitions between ideas\n5. Checking for grammar and punctuation accuracy\n```\n\n## Final Resources\n\n- [Download Complete Transcript](link-would-go-here)\n- **Helpful AI Prompts for Revision:**\n  1. \"Identify the main weaknesses in this paragraph\"\n  2. \"Suggest a stronger topic sentence that previews key points\"\n  3. \"Improve transitions between these ideas: [specific sentences]\"\n  4. \"Simplify this complex sentence while maintaining key information\"\n  5. \"Strengthen the conclusion to emphasize the importance of this topic\"\n</educational_content>"
