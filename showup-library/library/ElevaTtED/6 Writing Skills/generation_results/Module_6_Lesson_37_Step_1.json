Today, we'll work together to create your digital writing portfolio. This collection will showcase your best work and demonstrate your growth as a writer. Let's walk through this process step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Create Your Portfolio Shell\n\nFirst, we need to create the basic structure that will hold all your writing samples:\n\n1. Log in to your student dashboard\n2. Navigate to the \"My Portfolio\" section in the main menu\n3. Click the \"Create New Portfolio\" button\n4. Enter a title for your portfolio (example: \"Jane's Writing Collection\" or \"My Writing Journey 2023\")\n5. Select \"Writing Skills\" from the subject dropdown menu\n6. Click \"Create Portfolio\" to generate your empty portfolio shell\n\n**Check Point:** You should now see your new portfolio page with empty sections ready to be filled with your writing samples.\n\n## Step 2: Upload Your First Artifact\n\nNow let's add your first writing sample to your portfolio:\n\n1. Within your portfolio page, locate and click the \"Add Artifact\" button\n2. Select \"Upload Document\" from the options menu\n3. Choose the writing sample you'd like to include (this could be a narrative essay, poem, research paper, or other writing you're proud of)\n4. Click \"Open\" to upload the document\n5. Wait for the upload confirmation message\n\n**Pro Tip:** Choose a piece of writing that represents your best work or shows significant growth in your writing skills.\n\n## Step 3: Write a Caption\n\nAdding context to your writing sample helps readers understand its purpose and significance:\n\n1. In the \"Caption\" field below your uploaded document, write a brief description\n2. Your caption should include:\n   - The title of your writing piece\n   - When you created it\n   - The type of writing (narrative, persuasive, research, creative, etc.)\n   - What you learned or what skills you demonstrated\n   - Why you selected this piece for your portfolio\n\n**Example Caption:**\n\"'My Summer Adventure' - Personal Narrative (September 2023). This piece demonstrates my ability to use descriptive language and maintain a consistent narrative voice. I selected this work because it shows how I've improved at creating vivid imagery through specific word choice.\"\n\n## Autosave Progress\n\nGood news! The system automatically saves your work as you go. You'll notice a small \"Saved\" indicator in the bottom corner of your screen each time an autosave occurs. However, it's still good practice to:\n\n1. Check that the \"Saved\" indicator appears after making changes\n2. Click the \"Save Portfolio\" button before exiting to ensure all changes are preserved\n\n## Next Steps\n\nCongratulations on setting up your portfolio and adding your first artifact! In our next session, you'll learn how to organize multiple writing samples and create reflection entries to showcase your writing development.\n</educational_content>",
