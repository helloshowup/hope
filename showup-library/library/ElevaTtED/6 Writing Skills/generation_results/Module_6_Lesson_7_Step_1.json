In this activity, we'll work together to create a structured outline using our Interactive Outline Builder. This tool will help you organize your thoughts and create a solid foundation for your essays.\n\n## The Interactive Outline Builder\n\nOur Interactive Outline Builder guides you through the essential components of a strong essay outline:\n\n1. **Topic Selection**: Begin with a clear focus\n2. **Thesis Development**: Create a strong central argument\n3. **Main Points**: Identify key supporting ideas\n4. **Evidence Planning**: Plan specific support for each point\n\n## Let's Build an Outline Together\n\n### Step 1: Select Your Topic\nBegin by entering your essay topic in the prompt field. Choose something specific enough to explore thoroughly but broad enough to develop multiple points.\n\n**Example:** Instead of \"Social Media,\" try \"The impact of social media on teenage mental health\"\n\n### Step 2: Craft Your Thesis Statement\nYour thesis should:\n- Make a clear argument about your topic\n- Be specific and focused\n- Indicate the main areas you'll explore\n\n**Example:** \"While social media platforms provide valuable connection opportunities, they significantly impact teenage mental health through sleep disruption, anxiety from social comparison, and cyberbullying exposure.\"\n\n### Step 3: Develop Three Main Points\nEach main point should:\n- Support your thesis directly\n- Be distinct from other points\n- Be specific enough to explore in a full paragraph\n\n**Example Points:**\n1. Social media use before bedtime disrupts sleep patterns in teenagers\n2. Constant exposure to curated content leads to harmful social comparison\n3. Cyberbullying on social platforms contributes to depression and anxiety\n\n### Step 4: Add Evidence Slots\nFor each main point, identify 2-3 specific pieces of evidence:\n- Statistics or research findings\n- Expert opinions\n- Specific examples or case studies\n\n**Example Evidence for Point 1:**\n- 2019 study showing 70% of teens check social media within 30 minutes of bedtime\n- Research on blue light exposure and melatonin production\n- Survey data on average sleep reduction in heavy social media users\n\n## Real-Time Validation Tips\n\nAs you build your outline, watch for these helpful prompts:\n- \"Your thesis needs a clearer argument\" - Revise to include a specific position\n- \"Main point overlaps with another point\" - Ensure each point is distinct\n- \"Evidence is too general\" - Add specific data or examples\n- \"Strong connection between thesis and points!\" - Positive feedback when elements align well\n\n## Saving Your Work\n\nOnce you've completed your outline:\n1. Review the entire structure for coherence\n2. Make any final adjustments\n3. Click \"Save as PDF\" to download your outline\n4. Use this document as your roadmap when writing your essay\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis guided outline-building process helps you create a clear, logical structure for your essays. With practice, you'll develop the skills to organize your thoughts effectively, leading to stronger, more persuasive writing.\n\nRemember: A well-structured outline is the foundation of a successful essay!\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Interactive Outline Builder: Guided Practice\n\n## Introduction\nWelcome to our guided practice session on building effective essay outlines! Today, we'll work together through our Interactive Outline Builder tool. This structured approach helps you develop clear, compelling essay structures with real-time guidance and feedback.\n\n## The Interactive Outline Builder Tool\n\n### Step 1: Select Your Topic\nBegin by entering your essay topic in the prompt field. Choose something you're knowledgeable about or interested in exploring.\n\n**Example Topics:**\n- The impact of social media on teenage communication\n- Benefits of extracurricular activities in high school\n- How technology has changed education\n\n### Step 2: Craft Your Thesis Statement\nYour thesis statement is the central argument of your essay. It should be clear, specific, and debatable.\n\n**Thesis Guidelines:**\n- Make a specific claim (not just a fact)\n- Keep it focused (one main idea)\n- Make it arguable (someone could disagree)\n\n*Real-time Validation Tip: The system will highlight your thesis in green when it contains a clear argument and is between 15-35 words.*\n\n### Step 3: Develop Three Main Points\nEach main point should directly support your thesis. Think of these as the pillars of your argument.\n\n**For Each Main Point:**\n- Create a clear topic sentence\n- Ensure it connects directly to your thesis\n- Make it distinct from your other points\n\n*Real-time Validation Tip: The system will suggest revisions if your points overlap too much or don't clearly connect to your thesis.*\n\n### Step 4: Add Supporting Evidence\nFor each main point, you'll need to provide evidence slots. These are the specific examples, facts, statistics, or expert opinions that support your claims.\n\n**Evidence Requirements:**\n- Add at least 2 pieces of evidence per main point\n- Include a brief note about the source\n- Explain how this evidence supports your point\n\n*Real-time Validation Tip: The builder will prompt you if your evidence seems too vague or disconnected from your main point.*\n\n### Step 5: Review and Save Your Outline\nOnce you've completed all sections, review your outline as a whole:\n- Does each element connect logically?\n- Have you provided sufficient evidence?\n- Does your structure effectively support your thesis?\n\nWhen you're satisfied with your outline, use the \"Save as PDF\" button to download a copy for reference as you write your essay.\n\n## Practice Activity\nLet's work through an example together. Choose one of the suggested topics or enter your own, and we'll build an outline step by step, discussing our choices at each stage.\n\nRemember, this tool is designed to guide your thinking process, not restrict it. As you become more comfortable with outline building, you'll develop your own style while maintaining strong structural principles.\n\n## Next Steps\nAfter completing this guided practice, you'll be ready to use the Interactive Outline Builder independently for your upcoming essay assignments.\n</educational_content>",
