By examining our own writing process, we can identify strengths, challenges, and strategies for improvement. Today, we'll explore a sample reflection log together and practice creating our own reflections.\n\n### Sample Reflection Log with Analysis\n\nBelow is a sample reflection log from a student who completed a personal narrative assignment. Click on the highlighted portions to see instructor analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Sample Reflection Log: Personal Narrative Assignment**\n\n[**Today I spent about 45 minutes working on my personal narrative.**]{.hotspot1} I found it [**challenging to start my introduction**]{.hotspot2} because I wasn't sure which details would grab the reader's attention. Once I got past the introduction, [**the writing flowed more naturally**]{.hotspot3} as I described my camping trip experience.\n\n[**I'm proud of the sensory details I included**]{.hotspot4} about the smell of pine trees and the sound of the creek. I think these details make my narrative more engaging. However, I still need to work on [**creating a stronger conclusion**]{.hotspot5} that ties everything together.\n\n[**For my next writing session, I plan to revise my conclusion**]{.hotspot6} and add more dialogue between my family members to make the story more dynamic.\n\n---\n\n**Instructor Analysis:**\n\n<div class=\"hotspot-content\" id=\"hotspot1\">\nStrong time management - The student tracked their writing time, showing awareness of their process.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"hotspot-content\" id=\"hotspot2\">\nGood problem identification - Recognizing specific challenges is the first step to overcoming them.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"hotspot-content\" id=\"hotspot3\">\nProcess awareness - The student notices how their writing experience changes throughout the session.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"hotspot-content\" id=\"hotspot4\">\nSpecific strength identification - The student points to concrete elements they executed well.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"hotspot-content\" id=\"hotspot5\">\nTargeted improvement area - The student identifies a specific aspect needing work rather than making general statements.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"hotspot-content\" id=\"hotspot6\">\nAction plan - The reflection concludes with specific next steps, making this a productive tool for improvement.\n</div>\n\n### Your Turn: Practice Reflection\n\nNow it's your turn to practice writing a reflection.
