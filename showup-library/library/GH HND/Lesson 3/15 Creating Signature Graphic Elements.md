# DOWNLOADABLE RESOURCES TEMPLATE FOR ANY ONLINE COURSE

## HOSTING PAGE

Grid systems and pattern development are essential tools for creating professional brand identities that maintain their integrity across all applications. These downloadable resources will help you develop the systematic design approaches that employers and clients specifically look for when hiring graphic designers. By mastering these techniques, you'll elevate your work from student-level to industry-standard.

### Using These Resources

These PDFs are designed to be printed and used as practical worksheets during your design process. Start with the Grid System Implementation Guide to establish your structural framework, then move to the Pattern Scaling Worksheet to develop consistent brand patterns. Keep these resources in your design toolkit for reference on future projects.

### Available Resources

**PDF 1: Grid System Implementation Guide** - A practical framework for creating consistent brand elements using professional grid systems.

**PDF 2: Pattern Scaling Worksheet** - A step-by-step template for developing scalable patterns that maintain visual consistency across different applications.

### Process Note

These resources connect directly to your previous work on Creating Signature Graphic Elements, adding systematic structure to those distinctive brand components. The skills you develop here will prepare you for more advanced brand identity work and directly support your upcoming exploration of "Using Colour and Design to Shape Atmosphere."

## PDF 1 SPECIFICATIONS

**Title: Grid System Implementation Guide**

**Purpose:** This guide provides a practical framework for implementing professional grid systems that ensure your brand elements maintain consistent proportions, spacing, and alignment across all applications.

**Format:** ☑ Guide □ Worksheet □ Template □ Checklist

**Required Elements:**
- Clear instructions
- Visual examples
- Implementation steps
- Quality control points

# GRID SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## SELECTING THE RIGHT GRID TYPE
□ **Square Grid:** Best for app icons, UI elements, consistent sizing
□ **Circular Grid:** Ideal for logo marks, badges, radial symmetry
□ **Pixel Grid:** Optimised for screen display at multiple sizes
□ **Custom Hybrid:** Combined elements for specific brand needs

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
1. **Set Up Your Artboard**
   - Match grid dimensions (24px, 32px, or 64px for digital)
   - Enable snap-to-grid functionality
   - Set up layers: Grid (top), Elements, Background

2. **Align Key Elements**
   - Place conceptual sketches behind grid layer
   - Align primary shapes to grid intersections
   - Standardise stroke weights (typically 1px, 2px, or 4px)
   - Maintain consistent corner radii

3. **Test Across Scales**
   - Verify legibility at minimum size (16px)
   - Check proportions at standard sizes (32px, 64px)
   - Confirm alignment at all scales

## QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST
□ All elements align to grid intersections
□ Consistent stroke weights maintained
□ Corner radii standardised
□ Elements maintain proportions when scaled
□ Minimum 1px spacing between elements
□ Clear silhouette at smallest size

## EXAMPLE: ICON GRID APPLICATION

# PATTERN SCALING WORKSHEET

## PATTERN BASELINE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Define Core Element**
   □ Geometric   □ Organic   □ Typography-based   □ Brand-derived
   
   Sketch your core pattern element here:
   [Empty box for sketching]

2. **Establish Repeat Structure**
   □ Grid   □ Half-drop   □ Mirrored   □ Radial   □ Random
   
   Base unit dimensions: _____ × _____

## SCALING FRAMEWORK
Test your pattern at these three scales and document adjustments:

### SMALL SCALE (e.g., icon background, 16-32px)
□ Simplify elements if needed
□ Increase spacing between elements
□ Adjust stroke weight to minimum 1px

Adjustments made: _______________________________

### MEDIUM SCALE (e.g., website header, 200-500px)
□ Maintain all pattern elements
□ Standard spacing (baseline)
□ Standard stroke weights

Adjustments made: _______________________________

### LARGE SCALE (e.g., environmental graphics, 1000px+)
□ Consider adding detail to elements
□ Decrease relative spacing if needed
□ Adjust stroke weight proportionally

Adjustments made: _______________________________

## APPLICATION TESTING
