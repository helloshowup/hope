# Visual Hierarchy Across Platforms

## INFOGRAPHIC DESIGN BRIEF

### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
**Title:** Adapting Visual Hierarchies Across Platforms
**Subtitle:** A Designer's Guide to Consistent Brand Experience

**Opening Statement:**
Visual hierarchy determines how users process information across different platforms. This guide shows how to maintain brand consistency while adapting to the unique requirements of print, digital, mobile, and environmental design.

**Design Notes:** 
- Include a visual representation of the same brand element adapted across all four platforms <Create a simple logo or brand element that visually transforms across the four platforms while maintaining its core identity>
- Use arrows or connecting elements to show the transformation process <Use directional arrows to illustrate how design decisions change from one medium to another>

### SECTION 2: PLATFORM COMPARISON MATRIX
Create a visual table comparing how hierarchy elements adapt across platforms:

| Hierarchy Element | Print | Digital/Web | Mobile | Environmental |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **Typography Scale** | Static sizes (pt) | Responsive units (em, rem) | Minimum 16px body text | 1" letter per 10' viewing |
| **Colour & Contrast** | CMYK, paper affects perception | RGB, WCAG contrast ratios | High contrast, dark mode | Ambient light considerations |
| **White Space** | Fixed margins | Responsive spacing | Minimal but critical spacing | Physical space and movement paths |
| **Visual Weight** | Material weight enhances hierarchy | Interactive affordances | 44Ã—44px touch targets | Scale impacts prominence |
| **Movement** | Static visual flow | Scrolling, animations | Swipe patterns, thumb zones | Viewer movement changes perspective |

**Design Notes:**
- Use colour coding to highlight platform-specific considerations <Assign a distinct colour to each platform and use it consistently throughout the infographic to help students quickly identify platform-specific information>
- Include small visual examples for each cell in the matrix <such as showing how the same headline appears in different sizes across platforms>
- Add visual indicators showing relationships between platforms <Use connecting lines or gradients to show how elements evolve across platforms>

### SECTION 3: PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS
**Visualise four columns with icons representing each platform:**

**Print:**
- Tactile elements (paper stock, embossing) <Include tactile texture samples or visual representations of different paper stocks and embossing techniques>
- Special techniques (die-cuts, varnishes) <Show before/after examples of how special print techniques can enhance hierarchy>
- Fixed viewing sequence <Illustrate how designers control the reader's journey through a printed piece>
- CMYK colour limitations <Display the same colour in both RGB and CMYK to demonstrate gamut differences>

**Digital/Web:**
- Interactive states (hover, focus) <Show a button in its various states to demonstrate how interaction affects hierarchy>
- Responsive breakpoints <Illustrate how the same content reflows across different screen sizes>
- Scroll-based reveal <Demonstrate progressive disclosure techniques that reveal content as users scroll>
- Accessibility requirements <Include examples of accessible and inaccessible design with WCAG compliance indicators>

**Mobile:**
- Thumb zone prioritisation <Show a heat map of thumb reach areas on a mobile screen with key elements positioned accordingly>
- Limited screen real estate <Compare desktop and mobile versions of the same content to show prioritisation decisions>
- Device-specific guidelines <Include visual references to iOS and Android design guidelines>
- Touch target sizing <Illustrate minimum touch target sizes with examples of good and poor implementations>

**Environmental:**
- Viewing distance hierarchy <Show how text size and visual elements scale based on viewing distance>
- Multiple approach angles <Illustrate how environmental design must work from different viewing angles>
- Lighting conditions <Demonstrate how the same signage appears under different lighting conditions>
- Material durability <Show material choices appropriate for different environmental conditions>

**Design Notes:**
- Include small, practical examples for each bullet point <Each example should clearly demonstrate the principle in action, not just illustrate the concept>
- Consider showing a single design element adapted to each platform's constraints <Use a consistent brand element like a call-to-action button across all platforms to show adaptation>
