# Mockup Quality Assessment Guide

The Mockup Quality Assessment Guide offers a structured method for evaluating design mockups before moving to production. This systematic approach helps designs convey their intent clearly, satisfy technical needs, present content properly, and incorporate feedbackâ€”turning design from a reactive task into a strategic tool that links to business goals.

With this assessment method, teams can spot and fix design problems and usability issues early, which saves development costs, speeds up product launches, and improves user experience.

## Assessment Structure

### 1. Visual Accuracy Evaluation
**Purpose:** Judge how well the mockup captures the intended design

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Design element fidelity (typography, colours, imagery)
- Proportional accuracy
- Visual hierarchy representation
- Stylistic consistency with brand guidelines
- Lighting and shadow effects accuracy
- Material representation quality

**Verification Process:**
- Compare mockup against design specifications
- Review against approved style guides
- Evaluate from multiple viewing distances
- Check under different lighting conditions

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Note any visual discrepancies
- Document approved visual exceptions
- Record verification completion

### 2. Technical Feasibility Verification
**Purpose:** Confirm that the design can be implemented as shown in the mockup

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Production method compatibility
- Material limitations consideration
- Size and scale accuracy
- Technical specification adherence
- Production cost alignment
- Timeline feasibility

**Key Technical Considerations:**
- **Platform Constraints:** Check designs match target platform capabilities (mobile, web, email clients) based on solid understanding of the technology stack
- **Responsive Design:** Include designs for both mobile and desktop so content adapts across all screen sizes, accounting for extreme viewports
- **Performance Implications:** Consider image optimisation (background images under 500kb), animation complexity, and backend processing requirements
- **Development Efficiency:** Favour designs that translate well into HTML/CSS rather than relying on static images
- **Component Reusability:** Design with reusable patterns (menus, buttons, links) to support a component-based system for developers
- **Data Handling:** Test designs with data extremes so the interface handles diverse user inputs
- **Browser/Client Support:** Verify compatibility with various browsers and email clients for specific design elements
- **Scalability:** Make certain the design structure adapts for future features and content expansion

**Verification Process:**
- Consult with production specialists
- Review against technical constraints
- Check measurements and specifications
- Verify production methods

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Document technical limitations
- Record required modifications
- Note production considerations

### 3. Content Representation Review
**Purpose:** Verify placeholder content is realistic and appropriate

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Text content accuracy and appropriateness
- Image placeholder relevance
- Data visualisation accuracy
- Content hierarchy clarity
- Information density appropriateness
- Localisation considerations

**Content Quality Factors:**
- **Accuracy and Clarity:** Content should be clear, set appropriate expectations, and guide users
- **Legibility:** Text should be readable at different sizes and against various backgrounds
- **Grammar & Spelling:** All content must be error-free to maintain professionalism and credibility
- **Strategic Placeholder Use:** Use placeholders in early stages but add realistic content within the first two iterations
- **Conciseness:** Copy should be clear and accessible, suited to an 8th-grade reading level, without specialised jargon
- **Localisation Readiness:** Account for text expansion (allow 2x length), character support, and cultural inclusivity
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Consider colour meanings across cultures and support for text directionality (RTL languages)

**Verification Process:**
- Review all text elements
- Check image placeholders for relevance
- Verify information architecture
- Assess readability and legibility

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Document content issues
- Note required content updates
- Record content verification completion

### 4. Stakeholder Feedback Integration
**Purpose:** Verify that all feedback has been addressed

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Feedback implementation completeness
- Conflicting feedback resolution
- Feedback prioritisation appropriateness
- Change documentation accuracy
- Approval status clarity

**Verification Process:**
- Compare against feedback log
- Review change history
- Confirm with stakeholders
- Document outstanding items

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Maintain feedback tracking log
- Document resolution decisions
- Record approval confirmations
