# Asset Pipeline Tools and Templates

# Asset Pipeline Tools and Templates

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 3, Lesson 2

**Lesson Title:** Asset Pipeline Tools and Templates

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Download and implement the provided asset pipeline tools and templates
- Customize the templates to fit specific graphic design project requirements
- Identify which tools are appropriate for different digital asset management scenarios
- Apply the provided resources to establish version control in a digital asset pipeline

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

### Introduction

As a graphic designer, implementing a digital asset management system with proper version control requires more than just theoretical knowledge—it demands practical tools and templates that can be immediately applied to your workflow. This lesson provides downloadable resources that serve as the foundation for your asset pipeline implementation. 

Whether you're organizing files for a branding project, managing multiple iterations of design assets, or collaborating with team members, these tools will help standardize your approach, reduce setup time, and ensure best practices are followed. Building on our previous discussions of asset management principles, today we'll focus on practical resources you can download and implement in your design projects right away.

### Core Concept 1: Asset Pipeline Starter Kit

The Asset Pipeline Starter Kit is a comprehensive package of templates and configuration files designed to jumpstart your digital asset management implementation for graphic design projects. This downloadable resource includes folder structures, naming convention guides, and configuration files that follow industry standards while remaining customizable to your specific needs.

**Visual Example:**

Think of this starter kit as similar to a design template—it provides the basic structure and organization, but you'll still customize the final result to match your specific project requirements. The kit saves you from creating organizational systems from scratch while ensuring you follow proven practices used by professional design studios.

The starter kit includes:
- Pre-configured folder hierarchies for different design project types (branding, print, web, etc.)
- Metadata templates for various asset categories (images, vector files, fonts, etc.)
- README files with implementation instructions
- Configuration files for common version control systems

**Practical Application:** When starting your next design project, download this kit first and use it to set up your project folders before creating any assets. This will ensure all your work remains organized from the beginning.

### Core Concept 2: Version Control Templates and Scripts

Effective version control is essential for any graphic designer working on iterative projects or collaborating with others. Our downloadable Version Control Templates package provides ready-to-use configuration files for popular version control systems including Git, Perforce, and SVN, specifically optimized for design asset workflows.

**Visual Example:**

These templates function like a style guide for your file management—they provide tested instructions that work reliably but can be adjusted based on your specific project needs. By implementing these templates, you'll avoid common pitfalls in version control setup that can lead to lost work or confusion about which design version is current.

The package includes:
- .gitignore and .gitattributes files optimized for various design asset types (PSD, AI, XD, etc.)
- Batch/shell scripts for automated version tagging
- Configuration templates for branching strategies
- Documentation on implementation best practices

**Practical Application:** Use these templates to track changes to your design files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed or to maintain multiple design directions simultaneously.

### Core Concept 3: Asset Pipeline Automation Tools

The Asset Pipeline Automation Toolkit provides scripts and utilities that automate repetitive tasks in your design workflow. These tools help maintain consistency, reduce human error, and increase efficiency in your asset management processes.

**Visual Example:**

Consider these automation tools as similar to actions or batch processing in Adobe software—they handle specific tasks more efficiently than manual methods, freeing you to focus on creative work. Just as action scripts in Photoshop save time and ensure consistent results, these automation tools standardize routine asset management tasks.

The toolkit includes:
- File renaming utilities that enforce naming conventions for design assets
- Metadata extraction and embedding scripts for tracking design information
- Automated backup utilities to protect your work
- Asset validation tools that ensure files meet required specifications for print or web
- Reporting scripts that generate asset status summaries for client presentations

**Practical Application:** After completing a day of design work, run the automated backup utility to ensure all your files are safely stored. Use the file renaming utility when preparing final deliverables to ensure consistent naming that clients can easily understand.

### Over to You

How might you adapt these tools for your current design project? Consider a recent or upcoming project and identify which aspects of these tools would be most beneficial to your workflow. Share your thoughts in the discussion forum.

By downloading and implementing these resources, you'll have a solid foundation for your digital asset management system with proper version control. Remember to review the documentation included with each download for specific implementation instructions tailored to different design project environments.
