## Question 10
Which of the following is NOT a recommended practice for colour usage in design?

- A) Using colour as the sole means of conveying information
- B) Testing colours in various contexts (buttons, text, backgrounds)
- C) Implementing a defined colour system for consistency
- D) Adding underlines or icons to links, not just colour

**Correct Answer: A) Using colour as the sole means of conveying information**
Explanation: Using colour as the sole means of conveying information is not recommended as it creates accessibility issues for users with colour blindness or visual impairments. Additional indicators like text, icons, or underlines should accompany colour cues.

## Question 11
What is the minimum zoom level that web content should support without loss of functionality according to accessibility standards?

- A) 150%
- B) 175%
- C) 200%
- D) 250%

**Correct Answer: C) 200%**
