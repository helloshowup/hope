- [ ] Orientation changes (portrait/landscape) are handled gracefully

## Responsive Design Testing Matrix

| Device/Viewport | Key Check Area | Verification Point | Check (Yes/No/N/A) | Notes/Action Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mobile** | **Content Reflow** | Text reflows without horizontal scrolling at 320 CSS pixels | | |
| (320px-767px) | | Forms, images, tables, and UI components reflow correctly | | |
| | **Images** | Images scale correctly without distortion or overflow | | |
| | **Navigation** | Hamburger/collapsed menus are functional and legible | | |
| | **Interactive Elements** | Buttons/links are sufficiently large for touch targets | | |
| | | Forms are easy to fill out; pop-ups are responsive | | |
| **Tablet** | **Content Reflow** | Layout adapts appropriately, avoiding awkward breaks | | |
| (768px-1023px) | | All content remains visible and accessible | | |
| | **Images** | Images maintain clarity and aspect ratio | | |
| | **Navigation** | Navigation elements (e.g., expanded menus) function correctly | | |
| | **Interactive Elements** | All interactive elements are clickable/tappable and functional | | |
| **Desktop** | **Overall Layout** | Design maintains visual balance and consistency | | |
| (1024px+) | | Grid system elements (columns, gutters) are consistent | | |
| | **Content Reflow** | No unexpected content overlaps or empty spaces | | |
| | **Cross-Browser** | Design renders consistently across major web browsers | | |
| **General** | **Accessibility** | Text resizes/zooms to 200% without loss of functionality | | |
| (All Viewports) | | No restriction to single display orientation (unless essential) | | |
| | **Performance** | Site loads quickly across all devices | | |

## Responsive Design Essentials

### Content Reflow and Adaptability

Verify that content adapts appropriately by ensuring:

- Text, images, forms, and UI components rearrange and scale to fit different screen sizes
- Content collapses into a single column on smaller devices
- No horizontal scrolling is required at 320 CSS pixels width (WCAG 1.4.10)
- All content remains accessible when zooming to 400%
- Forms expand appropriately and are easy to complete on all devices
- All interactive elements function correctly across viewport sizes
- Layout maintains visual balance without awkward breaks or empty spaces

### Image Scaling and Optimisation

Images must function effectively across devices by:

- Scaling correctly without distortion, pixelation, or horizontal overflow
- Maintaining clarity and aspect ratio on different screen sizes
- Being optimised for performance to minimise load times
- Loading quickly without burdening mobile data plans
- Magnifying with minimal visual degradation when users zoom

### Interactive Element Behaviour

Test functionality across varying screen sizes by verifying:

- Forms expand appropriately and are easy to use with touch input
- Buttons are sufficiently large for comfortable tapping (minimum 44×44px)
- Navigation elements (including hamburger menus) are discoverable and functional
- Submenus, dropdowns, and search boxes transition smoothly without going off-screen
- Pop-ups are responsive and don't obstruct essential content
- Critical user journeys (forms, checkouts) work seamlessly across all devices
- All interactive elements remain clickable/tappable on all screens

### Cross-Device and Browser Compatibility

Ensure consistent rendering by:

- Testing across multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops)
- Verifying compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Using both device emulators and real devices for testing
- Implementing a browser compatibility test matrix
- Considering automated viewport testing for efficiency
- Checking that grid system elements remain consistent

### Accessibility in Responsive Layouts

Support various accessibility features by confirming:

- Users can zoom on mobile devices
- Text resizes to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Spacing between text elements remains adjustable
- Content works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Interactive elements have sufficiently large touch targets for users with motor impairments
- Typography maintains readability across all screen sizes


## Typography and Visual Hierarchy

When verifying responsive designs, ensure:

- Font sizes adapt appropriately to different screen sizes
- Minimum body text size of 16 pixels on web devices
- Heading hierarchy remains clear and consistent across viewports
- Text blocks remain concise and scannable on smaller screens
- Sufficient whitespace surrounds text elements at all breakpoints
- Background colours or images don't compromise text legibility

## Common Responsive Design Failures to Watch For

- Checkout or crucial interactive buttons disappearing on mobile views
- Navigation menus becoming inaccessible on certain breakpoints
- Form elements that extend beyond the viewport on smaller screens
- Images that distort or overflow their containers
- Text that becomes too small to read comfortably on mobile devices
- Inconsistent element spacing at different breakpoints
- Touch targets that are too small or too close together on mobile
