# 05.17 1C Alignment Verification, Checklist and Cheat Sheet

## Alignment Checklist

- [ ] **Grid system is consistently applied**
  * Verify that a chosen grid system (column, modular, or hierarchical) is implemented throughout the design
  * Check that all elements align precisely to the established grid
  * Confirm grid adaptability for responsive designs (typically 4 columns for mobile, 8 for tablet, 12 for desktop)

- [ ] **Elements align to defined margins and columns**
  * Ensure all content respects established margin boundaries
  * Verify consistent container padding and spacing
  * Check that related elements maintain consistent alignment relationships

- [ ] **Text blocks are properly aligned (left, right, centre, or justified as appropriate)**
  * Confirm text alignment is appropriate for content type and reading patterns
  * Use centre-aligned text sparingly (ideally for fewer than three lines)
  * Ensure justified text doesn't create awkward spacing or "rivers" of whitespace

- [ ] **Visual elements align with related content**
  * Check that images and illustrations align logically with their associated text
  * Verify icons align consistently with labels or text they accompany
  * Ensure interactive elements (buttons, forms) maintain alignment with related content

- [ ] **Consistent spacing between elements**
  * Confirm uniform spacing between similar elements throughout the design
  * Verify appropriate whitespace around text blocks and visual elements
  * Check that leading (line spacing), tracking (letter-spacing), and kerning (individual letter spacing) are consistent

- [ ] **Page elements are balanced and create visual harmony**
  * Ensure visual weight is distributed harmoniously across the layout
  * Verify the design has a clear focal point that anchors other elements
  * Check that no area of the design feels cluttered or empty in comparison to others

- [ ] **Alignment is consistent across multiple pages/screens**
  * Confirm recurring elements maintain consistent positioning across pages
  * Verify navigation, headers, and footers align consistently throughout
  * Check that alignment patterns create predictable user experiences

- [ ] **Elements are aligned to optical rather than mathematical centre when appropriate**
  * Verify visual elements are adjusted for optical balance rather than strict mathematical centring
  * Check that text with descenders or ascenders is optically aligned
  * Ensure logos and complex shapes are positioned for visual balance

- [ ] **Baseline grid is followed for text alignment**
  * Confirm text blocks align to the established baseline grid
  * Verify headings and body text maintain proper baseline relationships
  * Check that multi-column text maintains baseline alignment across columns

- [ ] **Responsive alignment breakpoints are defined and tested**
  * Verify alignment adjusts appropriately at defined breakpoints
  * Confirm content reflows without horizontal scrolling at minimum 320px width
  * Check that interactive elements maintain proper alignment and tap target sizes across devices
