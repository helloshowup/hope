# 05.17.2 B Colour Profile Verification Kit

## 1. Calibration Targets

### Monitor Calibration Tools
- Standard RGB calibration chart (included as downloadable file)
- Grayscale gradient test pattern for brightness and contrast adjustment
- Colour temperature reference card (6500K daylight standard)

### Calibration Procedure
1. Position your monitor away from direct light sources
2. Allow monitor to warm up for at least 30 minutes
3. Set monitor to native resolution and refresh rate
4. Use the included calibration software with hardware colorimeter
5. Verify calibration using the provided test patterns
6. Schedule regular recalibration (monthly recommended)

### Hardware Recommendations
- Recommended colorimeters: X-Rite i1Display Pro, Datacolor SpyderX Pro
- Alternative: Online calibration tools (limited accuracy but better than no calibration)

## 2. RGB to CMYK Conversion Guides

### Colour Space Understanding
- RGB colour space chart (additive colour model where colours start as black and become lighter as red, green, and blue light are added)
- CMYK colour space chart (subtractive colour model using physical inks that absorb specific wavelengths)
- Gamut comparison visualisation showing non-reproducible colours

### Conversion Best Practices
- Always design in the appropriate colour space for final output
- Use colour-managed applications (Adobe Creative Cloud recommended)
- Apply appropriate colour profiles early in the workflow
- Soft-proof designs using accurate profiles

### Common Conversion Issues
- Troubleshooting guide for dull colours after conversion
- Solutions for out-of-gamut colour warnings
- Reference swatches for problematic colours (bright blues, oranges)

### Conversion Workflow Chart
1. Identify output medium requirements
2. Select appropriate working colour space
   - sRGB: Default for web content, narrower gamut but better compatibility
   - Adobe RGB (1998): Wider gamut, especially in cyan and green hues
3. Apply correct colour profiles during design
4. Soft-proof with output profiles
5. Make targeted adjustments to maintain visual intent
6. Convert using appropriate rendering intent

## 3. Step-by-Step Verification Instructions

### Pre-Design Verification
1. Confirm monitor calibration status
2. Verify software colour settings match project requirements
3. Check that all team members are using identical colour settings
4. Document project-specific colour requirements

### During-Design Verification
1. Regularly soft-proof designs with output profiles
2. Use the included colour checklist for critical elements
3. Verify spot colours against physical swatch books
4. Check colour consistency across all artboards/pages

### Pre-Output Verification
1. Final soft-proofing with output-specific profiles
2. Verify all linked images use correct colour profiles
3. Check for out-of-gamut colour warnings
4. Confirm correct profile embedding settings
5. Generate and review colour separation previews for print projects

### Post-Output Verification
1. Compare physical output to calibrated screen display
2. Use the included colour evaluation card under standard lighting
3. Document any discrepancies for future reference
4. Verify colour consistency across multiple output samples

## 4. Colour Evaluation Standards

### Viewing Environment Standards
- Standard viewing booth specifications (D50 lighting, neutral grey surroundings)
- Alternative viewing setups for different contexts:
  - Office environment (controlled overhead lighting)
  - Client presentation environment (variable lighting considerations)
  - Remote approval process (screen sharing best practices)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Delta-E measurement guidelines and acceptable tolerances
- Visual assessment procedure using reference swatches
- Critical colour evaluation checklist (skin tones, brand colours, neutrals)

### File Preparation Standards
- Profile embedding requirements for different file formats
- Colour settings documentation template
- File naming conventions for colour space identification
- Metadata requirements for colour management information

### Output-Specific Standards
- Print: Paper stock considerations, ink limitations, press profiles
- Digital: Screen calibration verification, device gamut considerations
- Environmental: Lighting condition documentation for installation graphics
- Merchandise: Material-specific colour reproduction guidelines

## 5. Implementation Tools

### Quality Control Checklist
- Pre-flight colour verification points
- Common error identification guide
- Troubleshooting flowchart for colour issues

### Documentation Templates
- Colour specifications sheet
- Profile usage documentation
- Client approval form for colour standards

### Reference Materials
- Pantone to CMYK conversion chart
- RGB colour values for common brand colours
- Paper stock influence guide

## 6. Practical Exercises

### Colour Accuracy Assessment
1. Compare the provided digital and printed colour charts
2. Identify and document discrepancies
3. Adjust workflow to address identified issues

### Profile Verification Test
1. Process the sample file through your workflow
2. Compare output to the reference sample
3. Identify any profile mismatches or conversion errors

### Colour Communication Exercise
1. Document colour specifications using the provided template
2. Exchange specifications with a colleague
3. Verify mutual understanding of colour requirements

## 7. Device-Specific Calibration Guide

### Camera Calibration
- Use ColorChecker Passport (Calibrite ColorChecker Passport Photo 2, Datacolor SpyderCHECKR 24)
- Create camera-specific profiles for RAW workflows
- Set accurate white balance using Dual Illuminant Profiles to account for different lighting conditions

### Scanner Calibration
- Utilise IT8 targets (264 colour patches and 24-step grayscale)
- Compare scanned values with target's reference values
- Create ICC profiles that translate device-specific RGB to device-independent CIELAB

### Display Calibration
- Use colorimeters (Datacolor Spyder series, Calibrite Display 123)
- Shield device from ambient light during calibration
- Follow this process for accurate monitor calibration:
  1. Connect the colorimeter to a direct USB port
  2. Launch the accompanying calibration software
  3. Select the specific monitor to calibrate
  4. Choose full calibration for first-time setup
  5. Set target values for gamma, white point, and brightness
  6. Position the sensor flat against the display surface
  7. Allow the automated measurement process to complete
  8. Save the resulting ICC profile for consistent colour reproduction

### Printer Calibration
- Print device-specific test charts with target paper and ink
- Measure results with a spectrophotometer
- Generate ICC profiles specific to your printer/paper/ink combination

## 8. Soft Proofing Techniques

### Definition and Purpose
- Soft proofing is a technique for digitally simulating how your final output will appear without creating physical prints
- Provides a cost-effective way to check colour accuracy before committing to print

### Implementation Process
1. Ensure your monitor is properly calibrated (essential for accurate simulation)
2. Work in a controlled lighting environment (ideally D50, 5000K)
3. Enable soft proofing in your design software (e.g., Photoshop, InDesign)
4. Select the appropriate output profile for your target device
5. Enable gamut warnings to identify colours that may shift in the final output
6. Make targeted adjustments to preserve colour intent

### Best Practices
- Use soft proofing early and often throughout the design process
- Combine with occasional hard proofs for critical projects
- Document your soft proofing settings for consistency across team members
- Remember that soft proof accuracy depends on monitor quality and calibration
