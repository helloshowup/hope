# 05.04.0 Design Quality Assurance Resources

These specialized resources will help you implement professional-grade quality assurance in your design projects by blending traditional methods with digital techniques. Each worksheet and template is designed to boost your design process, build a stronger portfolio, and meet industry standards.

### Using These Resources

Incorporate these tools at different stages of your design processâ€”from planning through evaluation. Start with the Design Assessment Matrix during project planning, use the Evaluation Checklist during development and refinement, and implement the Planning Template when preparing final deliverables. Each resource can be printed or used digitally depending on your workflow preferences.

### Available Resources

**PDF 1:** [Design Assessment Matrix Worksheet](link) - A practical tool for mapping out and planning hybrid quality assurance approaches for your design projects.

### Process Note

This matrix helps you identify specific traditional and digital quality checks for each design element, encouraging thoughtful integration rather than treating them as separate processes. By mapping these connections at the beginning, you'll create better quality standards that you can apply throughout your project development.

**PDF 2:** [Hybrid Project Evaluation Checklist](link) - A thorough evaluation tool to assess both traditional and digital aspects of your design work.

### Process Note

Regular evaluation using this checklist helps you maintain quality standards throughout your design process rather than just at the end. The rating system provides quantifiable feedback that can be tracked across multiple project iterations, helping you identify patterns in your work and opportunities for growth in specific design areas.

**PDF 3:** [Implementation Planning Template](link) - A detailed planning guide to integrate hybrid quality assurance approaches into your workflow.

### Process Note

This template bridges the gap between theory and practice by transforming your quality assurance strategy into actionable steps. By documenting your hybrid approach, you're creating valuable process artifacts that demonstrate your methodical thinking to potential employers while also building repeatable workflows that can improve efficiency across multiple projects.
