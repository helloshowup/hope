### Typography Essentials

#### Font Consistency and Usage

Font consistency is paramount for professional design. Verify that:

- All fonts adhere to established brand guidelines and design systems
- Multiple fonts (if used) complement each other while remaining visually distinct
- Formatting attributes (style, background colors, size, alignment) are consistent across similar text elements
- Web designs utilize appropriate system fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Roboto) for broad compatibility
- No missing or inactive font files exist that could cause rendering issues

#### Visual Hierarchy and Readability

Effective typography establishes clear visual hierarchy by:

- Distinguishing between headings, subheadings, and body text through size, weight, and style
- Structuring headlines to convey content hierarchy
- Ensuring body copy is easily readable (avoid decorative or thin fonts for long passages)
- Using concise text blocks and bulleted lists to enhance scannability
- Making interactive elements descriptive and visually distinct
- Using center-aligned text sparingly (fewer than three lines)
- Applying styles like ALL CAPS, italics, bold, and underline selectively
- Ensuring background elements don't compromise text legibility

#### Detailed Spacing

Precise text spacing enhances legibility through:

- Appropriate leading (line spacing) for optimal readability (1.5-2.0 for documents)
- Consistent tracking (letter-spacing) within words
- Manual kerning adjustments for problematic letter pairs in headlines and logos
- Consistent line lengths within text blocks
- Sufficient whitespace around text elements to prevent cluttered appearance

#### Accessibility Standards for Text

Ensure text meets accessibility requirements:

- Minimum body text size of 16px for web content
- Minimum 12pt (preferably 14-18pt) for print materials
- Text can be resized/zoomed up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Spacing between letters, words, lines, and paragraphs is adjustable

## 2. Color Verification

- For AAA compliance: 7:1 ratio for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text
- Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify ratios
- Test print materials in black and white to reveal potential contrast issues

#### Functional Use of Color

Color must serve functional purposes beyond aesthetics:

- Never use color as the sole means of conveying information
