## Typography Quality Control Checklist

| Category | Verification Point | Check (Yes/No/N/A) | Notes/Action Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Font Consistency** | All fonts used are approved and consistent with brand guidelines/design system | | |
| | Multiple fonts (if used) are complementary and visually distinct | | |
| | Formatting (font, background colour, size, alignment) is consistent across similar text elements | | |
| | Default system fonts are used appropriately for web compatibility | | |
| | No missing or inactive font files are present | | |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Clear visual hierarchy established (headings, body, etc.) via size, weight, style | | |
| | Headlines and subheads convey content hierarchy effectively | | |
| | Body copy is easily readable; decorative/thin fonts avoided for long passages | | |
| | Text blocks are concise, using short copy/bulleted lists for scannability | | |
| | Interactive text (links, buttons) is descriptive and clearly visible | | |
| | Centre-aligned text is used sparingly (fewer than three lines) | | |
| | ALL CAPS, italics, bold, underline are used selectively, not for entire paragraphs | | |
| | Backgrounds do not obscure overlay text readability | | |
| **Detailed Spacing** | Leading (line spacing) is adjusted for optimal readability (e.g., 1.5-2.0 for documents) | | |
| | Tracking (letter-spacing) is consistently applied for legibility | | |
| | Kerning (individual letter spacing) is adjusted for problematic pairs | | |
| | Consistent line lengths are maintained within text blocks | | |
| | Sufficient whitespace surrounds text blocks and elements | | |
| **Accessibility** | Minimum body text size is 16px for web content | | |
| | Minimum text size is 12pt (14pt/18pt preferred) for print | | |
| | Text can be resized/zoomed to 200% without loss of content/functionality | | |
| | Spacing (letters, words, lines, paragraphs) is adjustable without loss of content | | |

## Typography Essentials

### Font Consistency and Usage

Font consistency is paramount for professional design. Verify that:

- All fonts adhere to established brand guidelines and design systems
- Multiple fonts (if used) complement each other while remaining visually distinct
- Formatting attributes (style, background colours, size, alignment) are consistent across similar text elements
- Web designs utilise appropriate system fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Roboto) for broad compatibility
- No missing or inactive font files exist that could cause rendering issues

### Visual Hierarchy and Readability

Effective typography establishes clear visual hierarchy by:

- Distinguishing between headings, subheadings, and body text through size, weight, and style
- Structuring headlines to convey content hierarchy
- Ensuring body copy is easily readable (avoid decorative or thin fonts for long passages)
- Using concise text blocks and bulleted lists to enhance scannability
- Making interactive elements descriptive and visually distinct
- Using centre-aligned text sparingly (fewer than three lines)
- Applying styles like ALL CAPS, italics, bold, and underline selectively
- Ensuring background elements don't compromise text legibility

### Detailed Spacing

Precise text spacing enhances legibility through:

- Appropriate leading (line spacing) for optimal readability (1.5-2.0 for documents)
- Consistent tracking (letter-spacing) within words
- Manual kerning adjustments for problematic letter pairs in headlines and logos
- Consistent line lengths within text blocks
- Sufficient whitespace around text elements to prevent cluttered appearance

### Accessibility Standards for Text

Ensure text meets accessibility requirements:

- Minimum body text size of 16px for web content
- Minimum 12pt (preferably 14-18pt) for print materials
- Text can be resized/zoomed up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Spacing between letters, words, lines, and paragraphs is adjustable
