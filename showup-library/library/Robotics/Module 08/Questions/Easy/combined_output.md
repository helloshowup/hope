# 8.08_Connecting_Sensors_to_Actions_generated.md

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Sensor Concepts
- Sensors help robots "see" and "feel" the world
- Sensors provide input data that robots use to make decisions
- Sensors serve as the robot's senses, allowing it to perceive its environment
- Different types of sensors:
  - Light sensors detect brightness
  - Distance sensors measure how far away objects are
  - Touch sensors detect pressure
  - Sound sensors can hear noises

## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- Input: Sensor data (light levels, distance measurements, touch detection)
- Processing: Code that interprets sensor readings and makes decisions
- Output: Actions the robot takes (motors moving, lights turning on, sounds playing)

## Examples of Sensor Systems
- Autonomous vacuum robot:
  - Input: Proximity sensors detect walls and obstacles
  - Processing: Code interprets readings to determine when to change direction
  - Output: Motor controllers adjust wheel speeds to turn or stop
- Line-following robot:
  - Uses light sensors pointed at the ground
  - Detects difference between dark line and lighter floor
  - Adjusts motors to stay on the line
- Refrigerator:
  - Uses temperature sensors to detect when it's getting too warm inside
  - Turns cooling system on when temperature rises
  - Turns cooling system off when temperature is low enough

## Programming Sensor Responses
- Conditional statements (if-then structures) create rules for robots to follow
- Basic sensor response pattern uses thresholds:
  - If sensor reading is above threshold, perform one action
  - If sensor reading is below threshold, perform different action
- Two primary ways robots respond to sensors:
  - Threshold-based: Taking different actions based on specific values (like on-off switches)
  - Continuous: Adjusting actions proportionally to sensor readings (like dimmer switches)

# 8.10_Testing_Sensor-Based_Programs_generated.md

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Sensor Testing Concepts

- Testing is important for sensor programs because:
  - Robots interact with the physical world
  - The real world is unpredictable and messy
  - A robot might work in one environment but fail in another
  - Testing helps find problems before they cause failures

- Purpose of testing sensor programs:
  - Prevents robots from crashing into walls
  - Prevents robots from getting stuck in corners
  - Helps understand how robots behave in different situations
  - Helps understand how robots behave in different environments

## Steps for Testing Sensor Programs

- Systematic approach to testing sensor programs includes:
  1. Test individual sensor inputs first
  2. Test simple conditional responses
  3. Test complex interactions
  4. Test edge cases
  5. Test in various environmental conditions

- When testing sensors:
  - Start simple and gradually add complexity
  - Make sure each sensor works correctly on its own
  - Test simple responses before complex behaviors
  - Test extreme situations ("edge cases")

## Debugging Sensor Programs

- Common debugging approaches:
  - Adding print/log statements to show sensor values
  - Using visualization tools to display sensor readings
  - Simplifying complex programs to isolate problems
  - Checking sensor calibration and physical mounting

- Causes of sensor problems:
  - Problems in code
  - Improper sensor mounting
  - Poor sensor calibration
  - Physical issues (like dust on sensors)

## Examples of Sensor Testing

- Testing a light sensor:
  - Check readings when shining a flashlight on it
  - Check readings when covering it with your hand

- Physical sensor issues:
  - A distance sensor tilted downward might detect the floor instead of obstacles
  - A light sensor covered in dust might not detect brightness changes accurately

# 8.11_Common_Programming_Errors_generated.md

# EASY Question Content for Common Programming Errors

## Types of Programming Errors
- There are three main types of coding errors
- Syntax errors
- Logic errors
- Runtime errors

## Syntax Errors
- Occur when code doesn't follow the programming language's rules
- Caught by the programming environment before the program runs
- Similar to spelling or grammar mistakes in writing
- Examples:
  - Missing punctuation (forgetting semicolons or brackets)
  - Misspelled commands or variable names
  - Incorrect capitalization in languages that are case-sensitive

## Logic Errors
- The program runs without crashing but doesn't behave as expected
- Examples:
  - Using the wrong mathematical operator (+ instead of -)
  - Creating infinite loops that never terminate
  - Setting incorrect values for variables
  - Writing conditions that never evaluate as expected

## Runtime Errors
- Happen when the program tries to do something impossible for the computer
- The program starts running normally but then encounters a situation it cannot handle
- Forces the program to stop working
- Examples:
  - Dividing by zero
  - Accessing undefined variables
  - Attempting to use resources that don't exist
  - Memory overflow errors

## Debugging Concepts
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors
- Professional programmers spend significant time finding and fixing problems
- Following a step-by-step process is better than making random changes

- Look for pattern blocks in the wrong order
- Check sensor values
- Slow down your robot to observe better

## Activity Facts
- The example robot needs to deliver medicine to a patient
