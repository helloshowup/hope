# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Programming Concepts

- **Programming Definition**
  - Programming is giving clear, step-by-step instructions for robots to follow
  - Robots cannot understand vague directions
  - Robots need exact details for every step

- **Programming Languages**
  - Special communication systems that let us "talk" to machines
  - Types include:
    - Text-based languages (Python, Java)
    - Visual block-based systems

## Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Model

- **Input**
  - Information flowing into a robot's "brain"
  - Examples:
    - Sensor readings
    - User commands
    - Stored data

- **Processing**
  - The "thinking" part where robots decide what to do
  - Activities include:
    - Making decisions with if-then logic
    - Crunching numbers
    - Following procedures

- **Output**
  - Visible results you can see or measure
  - Examples:
    - Physical movements
    - Sounds or lights
    - Screen displays
    - Recording information

## Key Programming Building Blocks

- **Variables**
  - Digital containers that store information
  - Help track changing information
  - Examples:
    - Robot speed (5 cm/second)
    - Distance measurements (25 cm away)

- **Algorithms**
  - Step-by-step instructions that solve problems
  - Characteristics:
    - Clear starting point
    - Logical sequence of steps
    - Clear endpoint or result

- **Control Structures**
  - Guide the flow of programs
  - Types include:
    - Sequential steps
    - Conditional choices (if-then)
    - Loops (repeat until)
    - Functions

- **Logical Operators**
  - Help robots make decisions
  - Types:
    - AND
    - OR
    - NOT
