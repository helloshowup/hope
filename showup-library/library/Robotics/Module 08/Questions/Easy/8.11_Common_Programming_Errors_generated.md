# EASY Question Content for Common Programming Errors

## Types of Programming Errors
- There are three main types of coding errors
- Syntax errors
- Logic errors
- Runtime errors

## Syntax Errors
- Occur when code doesn't follow the programming language's rules
- Caught by the programming environment before the program runs
- Similar to spelling or grammar mistakes in writing
- Examples:
  - Missing punctuation (forgetting semicolons or brackets)
  - Misspelled commands or variable names
  - Incorrect capitalization in languages that are case-sensitive

## Logic Errors
- The program runs without crashing but doesn't behave as expected
- Examples:
  - Using the wrong mathematical operator (+ instead of -)
  - Creating infinite loops that never terminate
  - Setting incorrect values for variables
  - Writing conditions that never evaluate as expected

## Runtime Errors
- Happen when the program tries to do something impossible for the computer
- The program starts running normally but then encounters a situation it cannot handle
- Forces the program to stop working
- Examples:
  - Dividing by zero
  - Accessing undefined variables
  - Attempting to use resources that don't exist
  - Memory overflow errors

## Debugging Concepts
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors
- Professional programmers spend significant time finding and fixing problems
- Following a step-by-step process is better than making random changes
