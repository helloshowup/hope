# Easy Multiple-Choice Question Content

## What is an Algorithm?
- An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions
- Algorithms are plans that robots can follow
- Algorithms need to be clear and precise

## Decomposition
- Decomposition means breaking down big tasks into smaller, manageable parts
- Example: "Clean your room" can be broken down into smaller tasks like:
  - Pick up clothes
  - Put away books
  - Make the bed
  - Vacuum the floor

## Precision in Instructions
- Robots cannot make assumptions like humans can
- Robots follow instructions exactly as given
- Example: Making a sandwich requires specific steps:
  1. Place bread on plate
  2. Spread butter on bread
  3. Add cheese on top of butter
  4. Place second slice of bread on top

## Sequence Structure
- Good sequences have:
  - A clear beginning
  - Logical order of steps
  - Appropriate level of detail
  - A definite ending

## Robot Programming Basics
- Robots need clear, step-by-step orders
- Robots take in information from sensors
- Robots process information and then perform actions
- Programs use variables and algorithms to help robots complete tasks

## Visual Programming
- Visual blocks can be used to create robot commands
- Programming with blocks is like using building blocks
- Visual programming is easier for beginners than typing code
