## Basic Sensor Concepts
- Sensors help robots "see" and "feel" the world
- Sensors provide input data that robots use to make decisions
- Sensors serve as the robot's senses, allowing it to perceive its environment
- Different types of sensors:
  - Light sensors detect brightness
  - Distance sensors measure how far away objects are
  - Touch sensors detect pressure
  - Sound sensors can hear noises

## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- Input: Sensor data (light levels, distance measurements, touch detection)
- Processing: Code that interprets sensor readings and makes decisions
- Output: Actions the robot takes (motors moving, lights turning on, sounds playing)

## Examples of Sensor Systems
- Autonomous vacuum robot:
  - Input: Proximity sensors detect walls and obstacles
  - Processing: Code interprets readings to determine when to change direction
  - Output: Motor controllers adjust wheel speeds to turn or stop
- Line-following robot:
  - Uses light sensors pointed at the ground
  - Detects difference between dark line and lighter floor
  - Adjusts motors to stay on the line
- Refrigerator:
  - Uses temperature sensors to detect when it's getting too warm inside
  - Turns cooling system on when temperature rises
  - Turns cooling system off when temperature is low enough

## Programming Sensor Responses
- Conditional statements (if-then structures) create rules for robots to follow
- Basic sensor response pattern uses thresholds:
  - If sensor reading is above threshold, perform one action
  - If sensor reading is below threshold, perform different action
- Two primary ways robots respond to sensors:
  - Threshold-based: Taking different actions based on specific values (like on-off switches)
  - Continuous: Adjusting actions proportionally to sensor readings (like dimmer switches)
