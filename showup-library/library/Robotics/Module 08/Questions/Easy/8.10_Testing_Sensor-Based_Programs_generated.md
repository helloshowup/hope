## Basic Sensor Testing Concepts

- Testing is important for sensor programs because:
  - Robots interact with the physical world
  - The real world is unpredictable and messy
  - A robot might work in one environment but fail in another
  - Testing helps find problems before they cause failures

- Purpose of testing sensor programs:
  - Prevents robots from crashing into walls
  - Prevents robots from getting stuck in corners
  - Helps understand how robots behave in different situations
  - Helps understand how robots behave in different environments

## Steps for Testing Sensor Programs

- Systematic approach to testing sensor programs includes:
  1. Test individual sensor inputs first
  2. Test simple conditional responses
  3. Test complex interactions
  4. Test edge cases
  5. Test in various environmental conditions

- When testing sensors:
  - Start simple and gradually add complexity
  - Make sure each sensor works correctly on its own
  - Test simple responses before complex behaviors
  - Test extreme situations ("edge cases")

## Debugging Sensor Programs

- Common debugging approaches:
  - Adding print/log statements to show sensor values
  - Using visualization tools to display sensor readings
  - Simplifying complex programs to isolate problems
  - Checking sensor calibration and physical mounting

- Causes of sensor problems:
  - Problems in code
  - Improper sensor mounting
  - Poor sensor calibration
  - Physical issues (like dust on sensors)

## Examples of Sensor Testing

- Testing a light sensor:
  - Check readings when shining a flashlight on it
  - Check readings when covering it with your hand

- Physical sensor issues:
  - A distance sensor tilted downward might detect the floor instead of obstacles
  - A light sensor covered in dust might not detect brightness changes accurately
