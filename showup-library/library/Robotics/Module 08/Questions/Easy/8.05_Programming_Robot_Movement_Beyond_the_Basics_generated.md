## Basic Robot Movement Commands
- Forward/backward movement
- Left/right turning
- Stopping
- Speed control

## Sequential Programming Facts
- Robots execute commands in sequence (one after another)
- The order of commands matters tremendously in robotics
- Switching the order of two commands will make the robot follow a different path
- Sequential execution creates paths and patterns

## Programming Examples
- L-shaped path example:
  - moveForward(10)
  - turnRight(90)
  - moveForward(5)

## Reusable Movement Blocks
- Grouping common movement patterns makes programming more efficient
- Reusable blocks make code easier to read and understand
- Functions can be created for common shapes (like squares)

## Key Concepts
- Robot programs make things move in the physical world
- Programming a robot is like creating a recipe the robot follows step by step
- Planning movement sequences before programming helps avoid mistakes
- Many robotics programmers sketch paths on paper first

## Relationship Between Programming and Movement
- Programs translate into physical robot movements
- Code converts thoughts into actions that happen in the real world
- Robot programming connects the digital world to the physical world
