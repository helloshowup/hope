# Easy Question Content for Debugging Process

## What is Debugging?
- Debugging is like being a robot doctor
- Debugging helps find out why a robot isn't behaving correctly and fix it
- A "bug" in computer programming means a mistake or error in instructions
- Bugs make robots do something unexpected

## The Debugging Process Steps
- Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Step 2: Reproduce the Error
- Step 3: Isolate the Issue
- Step 4: Fix and Test

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Observe what's happening with your robot
- Identify what the robot is doing now
- Determine what the robot should be doing instead
- Notice when the problem happens

## Step 2: Reproduce the Error
- Make the problem happen again on purpose
- Create a way to make the error occur reliably
- Use the reproduction to test solutions later

## Step 3: Isolate the Issue
- Find which part of the program is causing the problem
- Run one part of the program at a time
- Check if blocks are in the right order
- Look for missing or extra blocks

## Step 4: Fix and Test
- Make one change at a time
- Test after each change
- See if the robot works better after changes

## Common Robot Debugging Tips
- Check hardware (wheels, sensors, batteries)
- Look for pattern blocks in the wrong order
- Check sensor values
- Slow down your robot to observe better

## Activity Facts
- The example robot needs to deliver medicine to a patient
- The robot moves side to side instead of taking a direct path
- The robot completes one type of movement before starting another
