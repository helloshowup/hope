# Medium-Level Content for Multiple Choice Questions

## Syntax Errors
- How syntax errors impact program execution:
  - They prevent the program from running at all
  - They are caught by the programming environment before execution
  - They require understanding the relationship between language rules and program functionality
- Analyzing why syntax errors occur:
  - Case sensitivity issues cause different interpretations of what appears to be the same command
  - Missing punctuation creates ambiguity about where instructions begin and end
  - The relationship between human language flexibility versus computer language precision

## Logic Errors
- Characteristics that make logic errors challenging:
  - Programs run without crashing despite incorrect behavior
  - The computer executes instructions precisely as written, not as intended
  - Requires understanding the relationship between code written and expected outcomes
- Analyzing common logic error patterns:
  - Mathematical operator confusion and its consequences
  - Condition evaluation problems that prevent expected code paths
  - Variable value assignment errors and their cascading effects
  - Loop termination issues and their relationship to program flow

## Runtime Errors
- How runtime errors differ from other error types:
  - They occur during program execution rather than before
  - They represent impossible operations rather than syntactical mistakes
  - They cause program termination at the point of error
- Analyzing runtime error scenarios:
  - Division by zero as a mathematical impossibility
  - Resource access failures and their relationship to program assumptions
  - Memory management issues and their impact on program execution
  - The relationship between program instructions and physical limitations

## Debugging Approaches
- Application of systematic debugging methods:
  - Comparing doctor's diagnostic approach to programmer's debugging process
  - How structured debugging differs from random code changes
  - The relationship between error identification and appropriate solutions
- Analyzing effective debugging strategies:
  - How to determine which type of error you're facing
  - The connection between error messages and underlying problems
  - Why step-by-step diagnosis leads to faster resolution
