# Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Sensor Inputs in Programming
- How robots process sensor data to make decisions (similar to human sensory processing)
- Different types of sensors and their functions:
  - Touch sensors detect pressure
  - Light sensors detect brightness
  - Distance sensors measure proximity to objects
  - Sound sensors detect noises

## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- How the IPO framework connects sensor readings to robot behaviors:
  - **Input**: Sensor data collection (light, distance, touch, etc.)
  - **Processing**: Code that interprets readings and makes decisions
  - **Output**: Actions taken based on processing (motor movement, lights, sounds)
- Application examples:
  - Autonomous vacuum robot using proximity sensors to navigate
  - Line-following robot using light sensors to detect contrast between line and floor
  - Refrigerator using temperature sensors to regulate cooling cycles

## Creating Sensor Response Programs
- Conditional programming structures that connect sensor inputs to robot actions
- If-then structures and comparison operators in sensor-based programming
- Basic sensor response patterns:
  ```
  if (sensor_reading > threshold) {
      perform_action_A();
  } else {
      perform_action_B();
  }
  ```
- Multiple condition handling for complex behaviors (like line-following robots)

## Continuous vs. Threshold-Based Responses
- Threshold-based responses:
  - Function like on-off switches
  - Take different actions when readings cross specific values
  - Simpler to program but create abrupt changes
- Continuous responses:
  - Function like dimmer switches
  - Adjust actions proportionally to sensor readings
  - Create smoother, more natural movements
  - Require more complex programming
- Example of continuous response:
  - Robot adjusting speed based on distance to obstacle
  - Different behaviors at different distance ranges (full speed, proportional slowing, complete stop)

## Cause-Effect Relationships
- How sensor detection triggers specific programmed behaviors
- The relationship between sensor thresholds and robot decision-making
- How environmental changes affect robot behavior through sensor detection
