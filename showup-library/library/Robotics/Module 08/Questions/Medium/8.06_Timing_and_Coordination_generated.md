## Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

### Timing Concepts
- How timing affects robot movement coordination
  - Sequential timing: completing one movement before starting another
  - Parallel timing: executing multiple movements simultaneously
  - Delayed execution: programming pauses between movements
- Why timing matters for complex tasks
  - Example: robot driving forward then raising arm to pick up object
  - Consequences of improper timing (missing objects, failed tasks)

### Movement Programming Challenges
- How physical world variables affect robot movement
  - Surface differences (carpet vs. smooth floor) affecting turning accuracy
  - How friction impacts expected movement outcomes
  - Why theoretical programming often differs from real-world performance
- How environmental factors influence movement accuracy
  - Wheel slippage effects on precision
  - Surface changes requiring programming adjustments
  - Battery level impacts on movement consistency

### Testing and Troubleshooting
- How to identify common movement issues
  - Distance errors (too far/not far enough)
  - Turning errors (incorrect angles)
  - Inconsistent performance patterns
- Why testing and observation are crucial in robotics programming
  - Importance of adjusting and fine-tuning movement programs
  - Process for systematically addressing movement errors

### Real-World Applications
- How movement programming applies to assistive robots
  - Requirements for smooth navigation around obstacles
  - Programming considerations for human-robot interaction
  - How robots adjust to different environments (doorways, furniture)
- How robots coordinate sensors with movement
  - Example: weight sensors triggering movement changes
  - Following behaviors requiring sensor integration
  - Speed adjustments based on contextual needs

### Movement Sequences
- How to combine basic movements to create complex paths
  - Analysis of command sequences for geometric paths
  - Relationship between turns and forward movements
  - Applying sequential movements to create predictable patterns
