<h2>The Debugging Process</h2>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain what debugging means in simple terms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List the main steps of the debugging process</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Identify common problems in robot programs</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Debugging?</h2><p>Debugging is like being a robot doctor. When your robot isn't behaving correctly, debugging helps you find out why and fix it. The word "bug" in computer programming means a mistake or error in your instructions that makes your robot do something unexpected.</p>
<h2>The Debugging Process</h2><p>Just like a detective solving a mystery, debugging follows a step-by-step process to find clues and solve problems. When your robot starts acting strangely, you'll need these skills to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. Let's explore how to become a great robot troubleshooter!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When your robot isn't working right, follow these steps to find and fix the problem:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h3><p>Before jumping in to fix anything, it's important to take a moment to really understand what's happening with your robot. This first step is all about observation and asking the right questions - just like a scientist starting an experiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, you need to know exactly what's wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your robot doing now?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What should your robot be doing instead?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When does the problem happen?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if your robot is supposed to follow a black line but keeps driving off the line, notice exactly when this happens. Does it happen on straight lines or curves? Does it happen right away or after a while?</p>
<h3>Step 2: Reproduce the Error</h3><p>Once you understand what's going wrong, your next challenge is to make the problem happen again on purpose. This might sound strange - why would you want to make an error happen? But being able to reliably recreate the problem is actually super helpful for testing your solutions later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try to make the problem happen again and again in the same way. This helps you test if your fix works later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if your robot only has trouble when turning right, create a simple test where it turns right several times. This way, you can focus on just that part of your program.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Isolate the Issue</h3><p>Now that you can make the problem happen whenever you want, it's time to narrow down exactly which part of your program or robot is causing trouble. Think of your robot program like a recipe - if the cookies taste bad, you need to figure out which ingredient or step is wrong!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Find which part of your program is causing the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try running just one part of your program at a time</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Check your blocks to make sure they're in the right order</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Look for missing or extra blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is like being a detective! You're looking for clues about what might be causing the problem. Sometimes, the issue might be with how your robot is built, not just your program.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Fix and Test</h3><p>With the problem area identified, you're ready to try solutions! This is where your creativity and problem-solving skills really shine. The key is to be methodical and patient as you work through possible fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make one change at a time, then test to see if it fixed the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's important to change just one thing at a time. If you change many things at once and the robot works, you won't know which change actually fixed it! After each change, run your program to see if the robot works better.</p>
<h2>Common Robot Debugging Tips</h2><p>As you gain experience debugging robots, you'll start to recognize patterns in the types of problems that occur. Here are some helpful tips that experienced robot programmers use when troubleshooting - these might save you lots of time when your robot starts misbehaving!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check your hardware</strong>: Make sure wheels are attached properly, sensors are clean, and batteries are charged.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for pattern blocks in the wrong order</strong>: Sometimes blocks need to be in a specific sequence to work correctly.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check your sensor values</strong>: If your robot uses sensors, make sure they're detecting things correctly.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow down your robot</strong>: Sometimes running your robot at a slower speed can help you see what's happening.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Activity: Find the Bug</h2><p>Your helper robot needs to navigate through a room to deliver medicine to a patient, but something's wrong with its program. The robot keeps moving side to side instead of taking a direct path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Look at this simplified version of the robot's movement pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>The robot should move toward the patient by going forward/backward AND left/right as needed</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Instead, it only moves left/right completely before it starts moving forward/backward</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can you figure out what's wrong with the robot's instructions? Hint: The robot is completing one type of movement before starting another, instead of doing both types of movement together.</p>
