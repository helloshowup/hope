# 4.10 STUDY NOTES: TROUBLESHOOTING SENSOR SYSTEMS

## Key Learning Objectives
* Understanding common sensor failure modes
* Testing sensor functionality
* Troubleshooting and fixing sensor problems

## Common Sensor Failures
* **Complete sensor failure**
  * Sensor stops working entirely
  * Always reports same value regardless of conditions
  * Example: Light sensor showing identical readings in both light and dark

* **Intermittent failures**
  * Sensor works inconsistently
  * Often caused by loose connections
  * Difficult to diagnose due to inconsistent behavior
  * May function during testing but fail during operation

* **Environmental interference**
  * External factors affecting sensor readings
  * Examples:
    * Infrared sensors giving false readings in bright sunlight
    * Magnetic sensors affected by nearby metal objects

## Calibration and Reliability Issues
* **Calibration requirements**
  * Setting baseline/reference points for sensors
  * Example: Color sensors need calibration to recognize specific colors in current lighting
  * Uncalibrated sensors misinterpret environmental data

* **Sensor drift**
  * Gradual decrease in accuracy over time
  * Causes:
    * Component aging
    * Temperature changes
    * Physical wear

* **Reliability improvement strategies**
  * Redundant sensors (multiple sensors measuring same parameter)
  * Complementary sensors (different sensor types verifying each other)

## Testing and Verification Methods
* **Isolation testing**
  * Check each sensor individually
  * Example: Testing line sensor by placing robot on different colored surfaces

* **Comparison testing**
  * Compare suspect sensor against known good sensor
  * Example: Comparing identical robots' sensor readings under same conditions

* **Troubleshooting decision tree**
  1. Check if sensor gives any reading (power/connection issues)
  2. Verify if readings change when conditions change (functionality)
  3. Assess reading consistency (interference detection)
  4. Compare readings with expected values (calibration needs)

* **Additional testing approaches**
  * Visual inspection (especially for younger students)
  * Controlled environment testing (eliminating variables)

## Critical Assessment Points
* Understanding relationship between sensor failures and robot behavior
* Ability to systematically isolate sensor problems
* Knowledge of appropriate testing methods for different sensor types
* Recognition of environmental factors affecting sensor performance
* Skill in applying troubleshooting decision trees

## Conceptual Connections
* Sensor reliability directly impacts robot performance and behavior
* Multiple testing methods should be used in combination for effective diagnosis
* Environmental context significantly affects sensor function
* Calibration requirements vary by sensor type and application
* Redundancy improves system reliability but increases complexity
