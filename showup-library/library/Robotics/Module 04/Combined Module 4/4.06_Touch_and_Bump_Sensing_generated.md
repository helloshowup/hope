# Study Notes: Touch and Bump Sensing in Robotics

## Key Concepts and Learning Objectives
* **Core Learning Goals:**
  * Understanding how touch sensors enable robots to feel objects
  * Explaining how bump sensors help with obstacle avoidance
  * Identifying touch sensing applications for safety

## Touch Sensing Fundamentals
* **Purpose:** Provides physical contact information unlike vision sensing (which works at a distance)
* **Types of Touch Sensors:**
  * **Pressure sensors:** 
    * Measure force applied
    * Use materials that change electrical properties when compressed
  * **Capacitive touch sensors:**
    * Detect changes in electrical fields
    * Similar to smartphone touchscreens
    * Don't require physical pressure, just proximity to conductive objects
  * **Resistive touch sensors:**
    * Two layers with small gap between them
    * Pressure connects layers, completing electrical circuit
    * Inexpensive and simple implementation

## Bump Detection and Collision Avoidance
* **Bump Sensors:**
  * Specialized touch sensors for collision detection
  * Typically placed around robot's outer edges
  * Generate signal when physical contact occurs
  * Enable appropriate responses (stopping, changing direction)
* **Example Application:** Robot vacuum cleaners use bump sensors to navigate around furniture

## Advanced Touch Sensing Technologies
* **Cutting-Edge Developments:**
  * Artificial skin with embedded sensors
  * Force-feedback sensors for precise pressure measurement
