# 4.4 Sensor Charades

## Study Notes

### Sensor Fundamentals
* Sensors are devices that detect specific environmental inputs
* Each sensor type is specialized for particular input detection
* Selection of appropriate sensors depends on detection requirements

### Types of Sensors
* Light sensors - detect brightness, darkness, color
* Sound sensors - detect volume, frequency, patterns of sound
* Touch/pressure sensors - detect physical contact, force
* Other sensor types include:
  * Temperature sensors
  * Motion/proximity sensors
  * Humidity sensors

### Conceptual Relationships
* Input → Sensor → Data → Processing → Response pathway
* Environmental conditions determine which sensor is appropriate
* Multiple sensors can work together for complex detection scenarios

### Critical Assessment Points
* Matching sensor types to appropriate environmental inputs
* Understanding limitations of different sensor types
* Identifying real-world applications of various sensors
* Recognizing how sensors translate physical phenomena into data

### Learning Objectives
* Differentiate between sensor types and their functions
* Select appropriate sensors for specific detection needs
* Explain how sensors interact with the environment
* Connect sensor technology to practical applications

**Note:** This content supports the "Sensor Charades" activity where students act out environmental inputs while others identify the appropriate sensor type.
