Problem-solving game: Sensor Detective. Students are presented with mystery scenarios where a robot must identify something in its environment (like the temperature of a room or the distance to a wall). They must determine which sensor would be most appropriate and explain how it would help solve the mystery. For example: "A robot needs to navigate through a dark room without bumping into furniture. Which sensor would be best and why?"</p>
