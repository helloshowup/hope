## Identifying Necessary vs. Optional Features

- **Necessary features** are those that the robot needs to accomplish its core purpose
- A robot vacuum cleaner needs:
  - Wheels to move
  - Brushes to clean
  - Sensors to avoid falling down stairs

- **Optional features** might make a robot more convenient but aren't required for its main function
  - Example: A camera that creates a map of your home

- Questions designers can ask to determine if a feature is necessary:
  - "Can the robot still perform its core function without this feature?"
  - "Does the benefit of this feature outweigh the potential risks?"

- Example of necessary vs. optional features in a robot for people with disabilities:
  - Necessary: Sensors to detect obstacles
  - Optional: A camera that constantly records everything

## Privacy-by-Design Principles

- **Privacy-by-Design** means considering privacy from the very beginning of creating a robot

- Key principles include:
  - **Data minimization**: Collecting only information that's absolutely necessary
  - **Purpose limitation**: Using data only for the specific reason it was collected
  - **Transparency**: Clearly explaining what data is being collected and why
  - **User control**: Giving people choices about what data is collected and how it's used

- Example of Privacy-by-Design in a school robot:
  - Only collecting data about math problems students solve
  - Using this data only to adjust teaching difficulty
  - Having a clear display showing when it's recording
  - Letting students or teachers easily delete their data

## Robot Design Balance

- Robot designers need to create products that:
  - Work well for their intended purpose
  - Minimize unnecessary risks to safety and privacy
  - Build trust with users
