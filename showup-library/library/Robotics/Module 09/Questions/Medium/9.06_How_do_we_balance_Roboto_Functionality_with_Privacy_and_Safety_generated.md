# MEDIUM-Level Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Analyzing Necessary vs. Optional Features

- How to determine if a robot feature is necessary:
  - Apply the question: "Can the robot still perform its core function without this feature?"
  - Evaluate whether the benefit outweighs potential risks
  - Analyze the relationship between the feature and the robot's primary purpose

- Comparative examples of necessary vs. optional features:
  - Robot vacuum cleaner:
    - Necessary: Wheels for movement, brushes for cleaning, sensors to avoid falls
    - Optional: Camera mapping system (creates privacy concerns despite efficiency benefits)
  
  - Delivery robot:
    - Necessary: Location tracking (despite privacy implications, essential for core function)
    - [SKIP - suits EASY] Basic movement capabilities
  
  - Assistive robot for disabilities:
    - Necessary: Obstacle detection sensors (safety-critical)
    - Optional: Constant video recording (creates significant privacy concerns)

## Privacy-by-Design Implementation

- How Privacy-by-Design differs from traditional approaches:
  - Integrates privacy considerations from the beginning rather than as an afterthought
  - Requires analyzing privacy implications during initial design phases
  - Functions like building security features into blueprints rather than adding them later

- How to apply data minimization principles:
  - Process for determining what data is "absolutely necessary" 
  - Relationship between feature functionality and data collection requirements
  - Methods for achieving functionality with minimal personal data

- Purpose limitation application:
  - How to restrict data usage to specific, declared purposes
  - Processes for preventing function creep (using data beyond original intent)
  - Examples of appropriate vs. inappropriate secondary data uses

- Transparency mechanisms:
  - Methods for indicating when sensors are active (lights, displays)
  - Approaches for clearly communicating data collection practices
  - Techniques for making complex data usage understandable to users

- User control implementation:
  - Design of effective privacy settings interfaces
  - Methods for providing meaningful data deletion capabilities
  - Balancing ease-of-use with comprehensive control options

## Balancing Functionality with Privacy and Safety

- How to evaluate trade-offs between:
  - Functionality and privacy concerns
  - Convenience features and potential risks
  - Data collection needs and privacy protection

- Approaches for redesigning high-risk features:
  - Methods to achieve similar functionality with less invasive techniques
  - Examples of alternative designs that preserve privacy while maintaining core functions
  - Analysis of when a feature should be eliminated vs. redesigned
