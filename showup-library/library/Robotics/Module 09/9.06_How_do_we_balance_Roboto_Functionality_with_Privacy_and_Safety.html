<h1>How do we balance Roboto Functionality with Privacy and Safety?</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the key parts a robot needs from the extra parts it doesn't need</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List at least 3 ways to keep robot users safe and their info private</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pick the best robot design that keeps people safe while still doing its job</li>
</ul>
<h2>Identifying Necessary vs. Optional Features</h2><p>When designing robots, engineers need to carefully consider which features are truly necessary and which ones might create unnecessary risks. <strong>Necessary features</strong> are those that the robot needs to accomplish its core purpose. For example, a robot vacuum cleaner needs wheels to move, brushes to clean, and sensors to avoid falling down stairs. These features are essential for the robot to do its job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Optional features</strong> might make a robot more convenient or impressive, but aren't required for its main function. A robot vacuum might include a camera that creates a map of your home to improve cleaning efficiency. While helpful, this feature isn't absolutely necessary for cleaning floors and creates additional privacy concerns since it's capturing images of your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To determine if a feature is necessary, designers can ask questions like: "Can the robot still perform its core function without this feature?" and "Does the benefit of this feature outweigh the potential risks?" For instance, a delivery robot needs location tracking to find its destination, so this feature is necessary despite privacy implications. However, a toy robot probably doesn't need to record conversations, so this would be an optional feature with privacy risks that might outweigh its benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By carefully separating necessary from optional features, robot designers can create products that work well while minimizing unnecessary risks to safety and privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider a robot designed to help people with disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Necessary feature: Sensors to detect obstacles so it doesn't bump into the person</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Optional feature: A camera that constantly records everything the person does</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first feature is essential for safety, while the second might be helpful in some situations but creates significant privacy concerns and isn't required for the robot's main purpose of providing assistance.</p>
<h2>Privacy-by-Design Principles</h2><p><strong>Privacy-by-Design</strong> is an approach that considers privacy from the very beginning of creating a robot, rather than trying to add it later. It's like building a house with security features included in the blueprints, instead of trying to add locks and alarms after the house is already built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several important principles in Privacy-by-Design. First is <strong>data minimization</strong>, which means collecting only the information that's absolutely necessary. If a robot doesn't need to know your name or what you look like to vacuum your floor, it shouldn't collect that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another principle is <strong>purpose limitation</strong>, which means using data only for the specific reason it was collected. If a robot collects your voice to respond to commands, it shouldn't also use that data to figure out your age or mood unless you've agreed to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Transparency</strong> is also crucial â€“ robots and their makers should clearly explain what data they're collecting and why. This might include lights that show when cameras or microphones are active, or simple explanations of how data is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>User control</strong> is another key principle, giving people choices about what data is collected and how it's used. This could include easy-to-use privacy settings or the ability to delete stored information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When robot designers follow these Privacy-by-Design principles, they create products that respect people's privacy while still providing useful functions. This builds trust with users and helps prevent privacy problems before they occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, a school robot that helps teach math might apply these principles by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only collecting data about math problems students solve (data minimization)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Using this data only to adjust teaching difficulty, not for other purposes (purpose limitation)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having a clear display showing when it's recording student responses (transparency)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Letting students or teachers easily delete their data when desired (user control)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A company is designing a robot that will help elderly people in their homes. Which of the following features raises the most significant privacy concerns?</p>
<p>A. The robot can detect if a person has fallen</p>
<p>B. The robot constantly records video in all rooms to monitor for emergencies</p>
<p>C. The robot can measure room temperature</p>
<p>D. The robot can lift and carry objects</p>

                </p>
                <p>The correct answer is B. The robot constantly records video in all rooms to monitor for emergencies. While detecting falls is important for safety, constant video recording in all rooms is a significant privacy invasion. The company should consider less invasive alternatives like motion sensors or wearable fall detection devices that preserve privacy while maintaining safety. If you chose a different answer, consider how each feature impacts the balance between utility and privacy, and which ones could be redesigned to be less intrusive.</p>
