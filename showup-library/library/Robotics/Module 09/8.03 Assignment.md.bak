**Writing Exercise: Robot Ethics Reflection**

**Purpose**: This brief writing exercise will help you check your understanding of ethical considerations in robot design. This is a practice activity that won't be graded, but will help you think through the key concepts from our lesson.

**Prompt**:

Imagine a company has created a robot tutor that uses artificial intelligence to help students with homework. The robot costs $500 and requires high-speed internet to work properly.

In 1-2 paragraphs, answer this question:

***Using at least two of the ethical criteria we discussed (purpose, who benefits/who is harmed, transparency, or long-term consequences), explain whether this robot tutor design is ethical or unethical. What changes would you suggest to make it more fair for all students?***

**Requirements**:
* Write 1-2 well-developed paragraphs
* Reference at least two specific ethical criteria from the lesson
* Include your own suggestions for improving the robot's design
* Use examples to support your points

**Helpful Hints**:
- Think about which students can afford this robot and which cannot
- Consider what happens to students without high-speed internet
- Remember to explain WHY you think certain aspects are ethical or unethical
- Your suggestions should address the problems you identify

This exercise will help you practice applying ethical thinking to real robot design scenarios - a skill that's becoming increasingly important as robots become more common in our daily lives!


## Robot Ethics Reflection - Marking Rubric

| Criteria | 5 Points - Exemplary | 4 Points - Proficient | 3 Points - Developing | 2 Points - Needs Improvement | 1 Point - Unsatisfactory |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Understanding of Ethical Criteria** | Demonstrates exceptional understanding by correctly applying 2+ ethical criteria (purpose, who benefits/harms, transparency, long-term consequences) with clear explanations of how each applies to the robot tutor scenario. | Correctly applies 2 ethical criteria with good explanations showing solid understanding of the concepts. | Attempts to apply 2 ethical criteria but explanations may be unclear or show partial understanding. | References ethical criteria but shows limited understanding or only addresses 1 criterion adequately. | Does not reference ethical criteria from the lesson or shows no understanding of the concepts. |
| **Analysis & Critical Thinking** | Provides insightful analysis of ethical implications, clearly explaining WHY aspects are ethical/unethical with specific examples (e.g., cost barrier, internet requirement). | Good analysis with clear reasoning about ethical implications and some specific examples. | Basic analysis present but reasoning may be general or examples limited. | Minimal analysis with unclear reasoning or missing examples. | No clear analysis or critical thinking evident. |
| **Practical Solutions** | Offers creative, thoughtful suggestions that directly address identified problems and would realistically improve fairness for all students. | Provides good suggestions that address most identified problems and show consideration for fairness. | Includes basic suggestions that partially address problems but may lack detail or practicality. | Suggestions are vague, unrealistic, or don't clearly connect to identified problems. | No suggestions provided or suggestions are completely off-topic. |
| **Writing Quality & Organization** | 1-2 well-structured paragraphs with clear topic sentences, smooth transitions, and engaging language appropriate for middle school level. | Good paragraph structure with clear ideas and appropriate language, minor issues don't interfere with understanding. | Adequate paragraph structure but may lack clear organization or have some awkward phrasing. | Poor paragraph structure, ideas are difficult to follow, frequent errors interfere with understanding. | No clear paragraph structure, writing is confusing or incomprehensible. |
