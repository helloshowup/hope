            <p><strong>Writing Exercise: Robot Ethics Reflection</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This brief writing exercise will help you check your understanding of ethical considerations in robot design. This is a practice activity that won't be graded, but will help you think through the key concepts from our lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong>:</p>
<p>Imagine a company has created a robot tutor that uses artificial intelligence to help students with homework. The robot costs $500 and requires high-speed internet to work properly.</p>
<p>In 1-2 paragraphs, answer this question:</p>
<p><strong><em>Using at least two of the ethical criteria we discussed (purpose, who benefits/who is harmed, transparency, or long-term consequences), explain whether this robot tutor design is ethical or unethical. What changes would you suggest to make it more fair for all students?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:
* Write 1-2 well-developed paragraphs
* Reference at least two specific ethical criteria from the lesson
* Include your own suggestions for improving the robot's design
* Use examples to support your points</p>
<p><strong>Helpful Hints</strong>:
- Think about which students can afford this robot and which cannot
- Consider what happens to students without high-speed internet
- Remember to explain WHY you think certain aspects are ethical or unethical
- Your suggestions should address the problems you identify</p>
<p>This exercise will help you practice applying ethical thinking to real robot design scenarios - a skill that's becoming increasingly important as robots become more common in our daily lives!</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Understanding of Ethical Criteria</strong></td>
<td>Demonstrates exceptional understanding by correctly applying 2+ ethical criteria (purpose, who benefits/harms, transparency, long-term consequences) with clear explanations of how each applies to the robot tutor scenario.</td>
<td>Correctly applies 2 ethical criteria with good explanations showing solid understanding of the concepts.</td>
<td>Attempts to apply 2 ethical criteria but explanations may be unclear or show partial understanding.</td>
<td>References ethical criteria but shows limited understanding or only addresses 1 criterion adequately.</td>
<td>Does not reference ethical criteria from the lesson or shows no understanding of the concepts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Analysis &amp; Critical Thinking</strong></td>
<td>Provides insightful analysis of ethical implications, clearly explaining WHY aspects are ethical/unethical with specific examples (e.g., cost barrier, internet requirement).</td>
<td>Good analysis with clear reasoning about ethical implications and some specific examples.</td>
<td>Basic analysis present but reasoning may be general or examples limited.</td>
<td>Minimal analysis with unclear reasoning or missing examples.</td>
<td>No clear analysis or critical thinking evident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Practical Solutions</strong></td>
