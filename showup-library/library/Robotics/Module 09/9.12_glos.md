# 9.12 Glossary 

## Algorithm
**Definition:**  A set of step-by-step instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.

**Example:**  Just like you follow a recipe to bake cookies, robots follow algorithms to navigate around obstacles.

## Automation
**Definition:**  When machines do tasks that people used to do, often making the process faster or more efficient.

**Example:**  Self-checkout machines at grocery stores are a form of automation that lets customers scan their own items.

## Bias
**Definition:**  When a robot treats some people differently than others because of how it was programmed or what data it learned from.

**Example:**  If a robot only recognizes certain faces because it wasn't trained with diverse pictures, that's bias.

## Cloud Storage
**Definition:**  Saving information on internet servers instead of inside the robot itself, allowing access from anywhere.

**Example:**  When your robot vacuum sends maps of your home to the company's servers, it's using cloud storage.

## Collision Detection
**Definition:**  Technology that helps robots sense when they're about to bump into something or someone.

**Example:**  Your robot vacuum uses collision detection to avoid crashing into furniture or falling down stairs.

## Consent
**Definition:**  Getting permission from people before collecting their information or interacting with them.

**Example:**  A robot should ask before taking your picture or recording your voice, just like a friend would.

## Data Breach
**Definition:**  When private information collected by a robot is stolen or accidentally shared with unauthorized people.

**Example:**  If hackers break into a company's computers and steal robot camera footage from people's homes, that's a data breach.

## Data Minimization
**Definition:**  The practice of collecting only the information a robot absolutely needs to do its job.

**Example:**  A robot vacuum only needs to map your floors, not record conversations or take photos of people.

## Emergency Stop Button
**Definition:**  A button that immediately shuts down a robot if there's a problem or danger.

**Example:**  If a robot arm starts moving unpredictably in science class, you can press the big red emergency stop button.

## Encryption
**Definition:**  A way to scramble information so only authorized people can read it, like a secret code.

**Example:**  When you send a private message to a friend, encryption keeps others from reading it, just like a secret language.

## Ethics
**Definition:**  The study of right and wrong that helps us decide how robots should behave and be designed.

**Example:**  Ethics helps us decide if a delivery robot should prioritize speed or safety when navigating crowded sidewalks.

## Fail-safe
**Definition:**  A backup system that activates when something goes wrong with a robot to prevent accidents or harm.

**Example:**  If a robot's main computer stops working, a fail-safe might automatically shut down all moving parts.

## Force-sensing Technology
**Definition:**  Sensors that let robots feel how much pressure they're applying when touching or gripping objects.

**Example:**  A robot with force-sensing can hold an egg without breaking it or shake your hand without squeezing too hard.

## Inclusive Design
**Definition:**  Creating robots that everyone can use regardless of their abilities, language, or background.

**Example:**  A robot with both voice commands and buttons works for people who can see, hear, or do both.

## Input
**Definition:**  Information that robots collect from their environment through sensors, cameras, or microphones.

**Example:**  When you speak to a voice assistant, your words are the input it uses to understand your request.

## Local Storage
**Definition:**  Saving information inside the robot itself instead of sending it to internet servers.

**Example:**  A robot that keeps your voice commands stored only in its own memory is using local storage.

## Motion Limitations
**Definition:**  Restrictions built into robots that prevent them from moving too quickly or into unsafe areas.

**Example:**  A classroom robot has motion limitations so it moves slowly around students and can't reach dangerous heights.

## Output
**Definition:**  Actions that robots take in the world, like moving, making sounds, or displaying information.

**Example:**  When a robot vacuum changes direction after hitting a wall, that movement is an output.

## Privacy
**Definition:**  The right to control what personal information is collected and shared about you.

**Example:**  A robot shouldn't record video in your bedroom without permission because that would violate your privacy.

## Privacy-by-Design
**Definition:**  Building privacy protections into robots from the beginning instead of adding them later.

**Example:**  A robot designed with privacy in mind might have a light that shows when its camera is recording.

## Processing
**Definition:**  How robots analyze information and make decisions based on what their sensors detect.

**Example:**  When a robot vacuum sees a stain through its camera, processing helps it decide to clean that area more thoroughly.

## Purpose Limitation
**Definition:**  Using data only for the specific reason it was collected, not for other unexpected uses.

**Example:**  If a robot collects your voice to follow commands, it shouldn't also analyze your mood without permission.

## Redundant Systems
**Definition:**  Having backup parts or programs that take over if the main ones fail, making robots safer.

**Example:**  Airplanes have multiple computers doing the same job so if one breaks, the others keep working.

## Robot Ethics
**Definition:**  Rules and principles for designing robots that help people and don't cause harm.

**Example:**  Robot ethics helps designers decide if a delivery robot should prioritize speed or pedestrian safety.

## Safety Certification
**Definition:**  Official approval showing a robot has passed tests proving it's safe to use.

**Example:**  Before a robot toy can be sold in stores, it needs safety certification to prove it won't hurt children.

## Sensors
**Definition:**  Devices that help robots detect things in their environment, like light, sound, or movement.

**Example:**  Your phone uses a light sensor to make the screen brighter when you're outside in the sun.

## Stakeholders
**Definition:**  All the different people who might be affected by a robot, including users, bystanders, and helpers.

**Example:**  For a school robot, stakeholders include students, teachers, janitors, and visitors who interact with it.

## Three Laws of Robotics
**Definition:**  Famous rules created by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how robots should behave safely around humans.

**Example:**  Asimov's first law states that a robot may not harm a human or allow a human to be harmed.

## Transparency
**Definition:**  Being clear and honest about what a robot is doing, how it works, and what information it collects.

**Example:**  A robot with good transparency has a light that turns on whenever it's recording video.

## User Control
**Definition:**  Giving people choices about how robots work and what information they collect.

**Example:**  Good user control lets you easily turn off a robot's microphone when you want privacy.

## Visual Data
**Definition:**  Information robots collect through cameras, helping them see and navigate their environment.

**Example:**  A robot vacuum uses visual data to create maps of your home and avoid bumping into furniture.
