</h1>
<h2>Actuator</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A part that allows robots to move or interact with their environment, like motors or speakers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The robot arm uses actuators to bend and grab objects, similar to how your muscles help you pick up a pencil.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A step-by-step set of instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A line-following robot uses an algorithm that says 'if sensor sees black, turn right; if sensor sees white, turn left.'</p>
<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A creative thinking process where you generate many possible ideas without judging them first.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  During brainstorming, your team might list 20 different ways for a robot to climb stairs before picking the best one.</p>
<h2>Chassis</h2>
<p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong>  "CHAS-ee"</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The main body or frame of a robot that supports all the other parts.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The robot's chassis is like a car's frame - it holds the motors, battery, and computer parts together.</p>
<h2>Constraint</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A limitation your robot design must work within, such as size, weight, cost, or time.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  One constraint for your hallway robot is that it must be less than 12 inches tall to fit under the water fountain.</p>
<h2>Decision Matrix</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A chart that helps you compare different ideas using scores for important features.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your team used a decision matrix to compare three wheel designs by scoring each on speed, grip, and cost.</p>
<h2>Engineering Design Process</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A step-by-step approach for solving problems and creating solutions through planning rather than guesswork.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Using the engineering design process, you first define the problem before building anything, like planning a LEGO set before assembling.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Information that tells a robot whether its actions worked correctly so it can adjust if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The line-following robot gets feedback from its sensors about whether it's still on the line or needs to turn.</p>
<h2>Five Whys</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A problem-solving technique where you ask 'why' five times to find the root cause of an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Why does the robot turn left? Because one wheel spins faster. Why? Because its motor gets more power. Why? Because the wire connection is loose.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Information that a robot collects from its environment through sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your smartphone takes input when its touchscreen senses your finger taps or when its microphone hears your voice.</p>
<h2>Iteration</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The process of testing a design, making improvements, and testing again until it works well.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  After three iterations, the robot gripper could finally pick up eggs without breaking them.</p>
<h2>Mind Map</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A diagram that organizes ideas by connecting related concepts with branches from a central topic.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your robot design mind map might have 'Movement' as one branch with 'wheels,' 'legs,' and 'treads' connected to it.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Actions a robot takes based on its programming, such as moving, making sounds, or displaying information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When your game controller vibrates after you crash in a racing game, that's an output responding to what happened.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  How a robot's computer brain makes decisions based on input information from sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The maze-solving robot processes information from its distance sensors to decide whether to turn left, right, or go straight.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A clear description of the issue that needs to be solved and what a successful solution looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Our problem statement is: 'Create a robot that can sort recycling items by material type with 90% accuracy.'</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  An early working model of a robot built to test ideas before making the final version.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Before building the actual robot, we made a cardboard prototype to check if the arm could reach high enough.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The fundamental reason a problem exists, rather than just its symptoms or effects.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The robot kept stopping because of low battery (symptom), but the root cause was a damaged charging port.</p>
<h2>Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A device that detects changes in the environment and sends this information to the robot's brain.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Light sensors help a line-following robot stay on track, like how your eyes help you walk on a sidewalk.</p>
<h2>Servo Motor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A motor that can move to exact positions rather than just spinning continuously.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Robot arms use servo motors to move precisely to different angles, like when picking up an egg without breaking it.</p>
<h2>Stakeholder</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Any person who might use, benefit from, or be affected by your robot.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  For a school delivery robot, stakeholders include students receiving items, teachers sending materials, and janitors who maintain hallways.</p>
<h2>Systematic Approach</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Solving problems by following organized steps instead of random guessing or trial-and-error.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Using a systematic approach to fix your robot means testing one component at a time rather than changing everything at once.</p>
<h2>Trial-and-Error</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Making random changes and seeing what works, without following a specific plan.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Using trial-and-error, you might keep changing different parts of your robot until it finally works, but not know why.</p>
<h2>Validation</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Testing a robot in real-world conditions to make sure it actually solves the intended problem.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  After building your line-following robot, validation means testing it on the actual competition course, not just in your classroom.</p>
<h2>Verification</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Checking that your robot meets all the specific requirements you set at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Verification involves testing if your delivery robot can carry the required weight and navigate to all classroom locations.</p>
