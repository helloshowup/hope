# 6.6.3 Problem Analysis and Research Methods

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Use the "5 Whys" technique to identify the root cause of a problem
- Evaluate existing robotics solutions based on their effectiveness in addressing specific needs and constraints
- Develop effective questions for expert consultation that incorporate stakeholder needs and project constraints

## Deepening Our Design Process

Now that we've identified our stakeholders, assessed their needs (6.6.1), and established constraints and requirements (6.6.2), we're ready to dig deeper into the problem itself. This critical step makes sure we're addressing the actual issue rather than just its surface manifestations, which will lead to more effective robotics solutions.

## Problem Analysis Techniques

Before jumping to solutions, it's important to understand the problem you're trying to solve. This deeper analysis helps you address the real issue, not just its symptoms.

### Finding the Real Problem with Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis helps us look beyond the symptoms of a problem to find what's causing it. This builds on our stakeholder needs assessment by making sure we're solving the fundamental issues that matter to them, not just addressing surface concerns.

The **"5 Whys"** technique involves asking "why" repeatedly to dig deeper into a problem. For example, revisiting our cafeteria robot scenario from 6.6.1 and 6.6.2:

- Why do cafeteria staff need assistance? Because they're spending too much time transporting dishes.
- Why is dish transport taking so much time? Because the distance between dining areas and kitchen is substantial.
- Why is this distance problematic? Because it leaves less time for food preparation and serving.
- Why is food preparation time critical? Because nutritious meals require more preparation than pre-packaged options.
- Why is nutrition a priority? Because it affects student health and academic performance.

By the fifth "why," we've connected our robot design to a core educational value—student wellbeing and performance—which might change our priorities compared to if we had stopped at the first "why."

This analysis complements the constraints and requirements we established in 6.6.2 by making sure we're solving the most impactful problems within those boundaries.

## Research Methods for Robotics Solutions

Once you've defined your problem and established your constraints, the next step is researching potential solutions. Good research prevents you from "reinventing the wheel" and helps you build on existing knowledge.

### Finding Existing Solutions

Before creating something new, it's smart to see if similar problems have already been solved. This can save time and provide valuable insights while helping you work within the constraints identified in 6.6.2.

Start by searching for existing robotics solutions that address similar problems. Look at:

- Commercial products that might solve or address part of your problem
- Open-source robotics projects on platforms like GitHub or Instructables
- Academic research papers (even just reading the abstracts can be useful)
- Robotics competition entries that tackled similar challenges

For example, if you're designing a robot to help sort recyclables in a school (addressing the environmental stakeholder needs we might have identified in 6.6.1), you should research existing sorting technologies while keeping in mind the school-specific constraints from 6.6.2, such as budget limitations and safety requirements.

Look at existing solutions and ask:

- What works well about this solution within our identified constraints?
- What limitations does it have relative to our specific requirements?
- How could it be adapted to better fit the needs of our particular stakeholders?
- What components or techniques could we borrow or learn from while staying within our constraint map?

This approach connects your research to the stakeholder needs and design parameters established in previous steps.

### Real-World Example: Weather Station Robot

Let's look at how a real-world project used problem definition and research. A school wanted to create a weather station robot that could collect data around their campus and respond to changing conditions.

First, they defined their problem based on stakeholder needs (as we would have done in 6.6.1): "Our school needs accurate weather data from different locations on campus to support science classes, but manual collection is inconsistent and time-consuming."

Then they established constraints (as in 6.6.2): budget under $500, must operate outdoors in various weather conditions, must be maintainable by students, and must integrate with existing school technology.

They researched existing solutions by:
1. Looking at commercial weather stations (too expensive and fixed in one location)
2. Studying DIY weather station projects online (good sensor ideas but not mobile)
3. Examining agricultural robots that monitor field conditions (good mobility concepts)

By combining ideas from these existing solutions while respecting their established constraints, they designed a mobile robot with temperature, humidity, and light sensors that could travel to different campus locations on a programmed schedule and upload data to the school's science website.

### Expert Consultation

Experts can provide valuable insights that might take you weeks or months to discover on your own. They can help identify potential pitfalls, suggest approaches you hadn't considered, and provide feedback on your ideas—all within the context of your established constraints and requirements.

Potential experts to consult might include:

- Teachers with robotics experience
- Local engineers or programmers
- College students studying robotics or engineering
- Members of robotics clubs or teams
- Professionals working in fields related to your problem

Before talking with experts, prepare by reviewing the stakeholder needs and constraints you've already identified (from 6.6.1 and 6.6.2). This context helps them provide more relevant advice. For example: "We're designing a cafeteria robot that needs to navigate around students and carry up to 20 trays, all within a $1,000 budget. What sensors would you recommend for obstacle detection?"

Even a 15-minute conversation with someone knowledgeable can provide insights that greatly improve your solution while helping you work within your established constraints.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a problem you've faced lately. How would you apply the "5 Whys" technique to find its root cause? Try writing down each "why" to see how deep you can go. Then consider how this deeper understanding might change your approach to solving it within the constraints you face.
