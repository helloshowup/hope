# Robotics Glossary

## Actuator
**Definition:**  A part that allows robots to move or interact with their environment, like motors or speakers.

**Example:**  The robot arm uses actuators to bend and grab objects, similar to how your muscles help you pick up a pencil.

## Algorithm
**Definition:**  A step-by-step set of instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.

**Example:**  A line-following robot uses an algorithm that says 'if sensor sees black, turn right; if sensor sees white, turn left.'

## Brainstorming
**Definition:**  A creative thinking process where you generate many possible ideas without judging them first.

**Example:**  During brainstorming, your team might list 20 different ways for a robot to climb stairs before picking the best one.

## Chassis
**Pronunciation:**  "CHAS-ee"

**Definition:**  The main body or frame of a robot that supports all the other parts.

**Example:**  The robot's chassis is like a car's frame - it holds the motors, battery, and computer parts together.

## Constraint
**Definition:**  A limitation your robot design must work within, such as size, weight, cost, or time.

**Example:**  One constraint for your hallway robot is that it must be less than 12 inches tall to fit under the water fountain.

## Decision Matrix
**Definition:**  A chart that helps you compare different ideas using scores for important features.

**Example:**  Your team used a decision matrix to compare three wheel designs by scoring each on speed, grip, and cost.

## Engineering Design Process
**Definition:**  A step-by-step approach for solving problems and creating solutions through planning rather than guesswork.

**Example:**  Using the engineering design process, you first define the problem before building anything, like planning a LEGO set before assembling.

## Feedback
**Definition:**  Information that tells a robot whether its actions worked correctly so it can adjust if needed.

**Example:**  The line-following robot gets feedback from its sensors about whether it's still on the line or needs to turn.

## Five Whys
**Definition:**  A problem-solving technique where you ask 'why' five times to find the root cause of an issue.

**Example:**  Why does the robot turn left? Because one wheel spins faster. Why? Because its motor gets more power. Why? Because the wire connection is loose.

## Input
**Definition:**  Information that a robot collects from its environment through sensors.

**Example:**  Your smartphone takes input when its touchscreen senses your finger taps or when its microphone hears your voice.

## Iteration
**Definition:**  The process of testing a design, making improvements, and testing again until it works well.

**Example:**  After three iterations, the robot gripper could finally pick up eggs without breaking them.

## Mind Map
**Definition:**  A diagram that organizes ideas by connecting related concepts with branches from a central topic.

**Example:**  Your robot design mind map might have 'Movement' as one branch with 'wheels,' 'legs,' and 'treads' connected to it.

## Output
**Definition:**  Actions a robot takes based on its programming, such as moving, making sounds, or displaying information.

**Example:**  When your game controller vibrates after you crash in a racing game, that's an output responding to what happened.

## Processing
**Definition:**  How a robot's computer brain makes decisions based on input information from sensors.

**Example:**  The maze-solving robot processes information from its distance sensors to decide whether to turn left, right, or go straight.

## Problem Statement
**Definition:**  A clear description of the issue that needs to be solved and what a successful solution looks like.

**Example:**  Our problem statement is: 'Create a robot that can sort recycling items by material type with 90% accuracy.'

## Prototype
**Definition:**  An early working model of a robot built to test ideas before making the final version.

**Example:**  Before building the actual robot, we made a cardboard prototype to check if the arm could reach high enough.

## Root Cause
**Definition:**  The fundamental reason a problem exists, rather than just its symptoms or effects.

**Example:**  The robot kept stopping because of low battery (symptom), but the root cause was a damaged charging port.

## Sensor
**Definition:**  A device that detects changes in the environment and sends this information to the robot's brain.

**Example:**  Light sensors help a line-following robot stay on track, like how your eyes help you walk on a sidewalk.

## Servo Motor
**Definition:**  A motor that can move to exact positions rather than just spinning continuously.

**Example:**  Robot arms use servo motors to move precisely to different angles, like when picking up an egg without breaking it.

## Stakeholder
**Definition:**  Any person who might use, benefit from, or be affected by your robot.

**Example:**  For a school delivery robot, stakeholders include students receiving items, teachers sending materials, and janitors who maintain hallways.

## Systematic Approach
**Definition:**  Solving problems by following organized steps instead of random guessing or trial-and-error.

**Example:**  Using a systematic approach to fix your robot means testing one component at a time rather than changing everything at once.

## Trial-and-Error
**Definition:**  Making random changes and seeing what works, without following a specific plan.

**Example:**  Using trial-and-error, you might keep changing different parts of your robot until it finally works, but not know why.

## Validation
**Definition:**  Testing a robot in real-world conditions to make sure it actually solves the intended problem.

**Example:**  After building your line-following robot, validation means testing it on the actual competition course, not just in your classroom.

## Verification
**Definition:**  Checking that your robot meets all the specific requirements you set at the beginning.

**Example:**  Verification involves testing if your delivery robot can carry the required weight and navigate to all classroom locations.
