# Connecting to Input-Processing-Output

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Show how robots use input, process, and output in the design steps
- Name the parts of a weather robot and what they do
- Explain how robots sense, think, and act to solve problems

We've explored the engineering design process, let's see how it connects with the input-processing-output framework we've been using to understand robots. These aren't separate ideas - they actually work together! When engineers design robots, they're constantly thinking about how the robot will sense its world, make decisions, and take actions. Let's explore how these pieces fit together throughout each step of the design process.

## How Robots Sense: Inputs in the Design Process

When designing robots, the input components are essential because they determine how your robot will gather information about its environment. During the engineering design process, you'll make important decisions about what types of inputs your robot needs and how they should function.

In the "Define the Problem" step, you identify what information your robot needs to collect. For example, if you're designing a line-following robot, you need inputs that can detect the line. During the "Research and Ideate" phase, you'll explore different input options like infrared sensors, light sensors, or cameras.

By the "Design Solutions" step, you'll select specific input components and plan their placement on the robot. For instance, you might decide to use three infrared sensors positioned at the front of your robot to detect the line with greater accuracy. During "Build and Test," you'll install these sensors and evaluate how well they detect the line under different conditions.

The "Improve and Iterate" phase often involves refining your input systems. You might adjust sensor positions, add additional sensors, or modify the sensitivity settings to improve how your robot gathers information.

## How Robots Think: Processing in the Design Process

The processing elements of your robot are where the "thinking" happens â€“ how your robot will make decisions based on the inputs it receives. Throughout the engineering design process, you'll develop and refine this critical component.

During the "Define the Problem" step, you determine what decisions your robot needs to make. For a maze-solving robot, the processing must handle navigation decisions at intersections. In the "Research and Ideate" phase, you might explore different algorithms like wall-following or mapping approaches.

The "Design Solutions" step involves creating detailed plans for your processing system, including programming flowcharts that show how your robot will respond to different input scenarios. For example, you might design logic that says "If the right sensor detects a wall, turn left."

When you reach "Build and Test," you'll implement your processing design through programming and test how well your robot makes decisions. This often reveals the need for adjustments in your logic or algorithm.

The "Improve and Iterate" phase frequently focuses on refining the processing elements. You might add more sophisticated decision-making capabilities, optimize your code for faster response times, or create more robust error-handling routines.

## How Robots Act: Outputs in the Design Process

The output components determine how your robot will act on its decisions and interact with the world. Throughout the engineering design process, you'll select and refine these action systems.

In the "Define the Problem" step, you identify what actions your robot needs to perform. For a robot that sorts objects, outputs might include movement and a mechanism to pick up and place items. During "Research and Ideate," you'll explore different motor types, grippers, or other mechanisms that could perform these actions.

The "Design Solutions" phase involves creating detailed plans for your output systems, including mechanical designs for moving parts and specifications for motors or servos. For example, you might design a robotic arm with specific dimensions and movement capabilities.

During "Build and Test," you'll construct these output systems and evaluate their performance. You might test how accurately your robot can place objects or how smoothly it navigates around obstacles.

The "Improve and Iterate" phase often focuses on refining output systems for better performance. You might adjust motor speeds, redesign mechanical components for greater precision, or add feedback systems that help the robot correct its movements.

## Real-World Example: Weather Station Robots

Let's look at how the input-processing-output framework applies to a real-world example: a weather station robot that collects environmental data and responds to changing conditions.

**Inputs:** A weather station robot might include:
- Temperature sensors to measure air temperature
- Humidity sensors to detect moisture in the air
- Wind speed sensors to measure how fast the wind is blowing
- Rain sensors to detect precipitation
- Light sensors to measure sunlight levels

**Processing:** The robot's processing system would:
- Collect data from all sensors regularly
- Compare readings to normal ranges
- Identify patterns or sudden changes
- Make decisions about when to take protective actions
- Store data for later analysis

**Outputs:** Based on its processing, the robot might:
- Close protective covers when rain is detected
- Rotate solar panels to follow the sun
- Send alert messages when extreme conditions are detected
- Display current weather information on a screen
- Adjust its position to get better readings

During the engineering design process, the team would need to carefully consider each of these elements. In the "Define the Problem" step, they would determine what weather conditions to monitor and what actions the robot should take. In "Research and Ideate," they would explore different sensor options and protection mechanisms. The "Design Solutions" phase would involve creating detailed plans for how all these components would work together. During "Build and Test," they would construct the weather station and test it under various conditions. Finally, in "Improve and Iterate," they would refine the system based on performance in real weather situations.

---checkyourunderstanding---
Which of the following best describes the relationship between the engineering design process and the input-processing-output framework?

A. They are completely separate approaches that cannot be used together

B. The engineering design process replaces the need for the input-processing-output framework

C. The input-processing-output framework helps organize the components selected during the design process

D. The engineering design process only applies to the programming aspects of robotics
---answer---
The correct answer is C. The input-processing-output framework helps organize the components selected during the design process. The engineering design process provides the overall methodology for solving problems, while the input-processing-output framework helps specifically with organizing how a robot will gather information (inputs), process that information, and respond (outputs) when designing robot solutions. If you chose a different answer, remember that these frameworks complement each other rather than competing or replacing one another.
