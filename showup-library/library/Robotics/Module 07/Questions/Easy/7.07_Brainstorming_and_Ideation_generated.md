## Basic Concepts and Definitions

- **Brainstorming**
  - A creative process that helps generate multiple possible approaches to solving a problem
  - Used after researching existing solutions

- **Mind Mapping**
  - A visual way to organize ideas
  - Start with main problem in the middle of paper
  - Draw lines coming out with different ideas
  - Add more branches with details for each idea
  - Helps see how ideas connect
  - Makes organizing thoughts easier

- **Structured Brainstorming**
  - Helps organize ideas in a systematic way
  - Mind mapping is one example of structured brainstorming

## Collaborative Ideation Methods

- **Round-robin brainstorming**
  - Each team member takes turns sharing one idea at a time
  - Ensures everyone contributes equally

- **Brainwriting**
  - Team members write down ideas independently before sharing
  - Prevents louder voices from controlling the conversation
  - Gives quieter members equal input

- **"Yes, and..." building**
  - Borrowed from improvisational theater
  - Each person builds on the previous idea rather than criticizing it
  - Creates a positive atmosphere

## Evaluation Tools

- **Evaluation criteria**
  - Like a checklist to help pick the best robot design
  - Should be clear, measurable, important, and complete
  - Examples of criteria categories:
    - "Can we build it?"
    - "Does it work well?"
    - "What resources do we need?"
    - "Is it easy to use?"
    - "Is it strong and reliable?"

- **Decision Matrix**
  - A scorecard that helps pick the best solution
  - Steps to create one:
    1. Make a table with ideas across the top
    2. List criteria down the side
    3. Give each criterion an importance number (1-5)
    4. Score each idea on each criterion (1-5)
    5. Multiply scores by importance numbers
    6. Add up all scores for each idea
    7. Highest score wins

- **What to do if two ideas get the same score**
  - Add another important feature to judge them on
  - Build simple test versions of both
  - Combine the best parts from each idea
