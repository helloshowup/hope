# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Method
- The three-step pattern for how robots work:
  - **Input** - Robots use sensors to gather information from the environment
  - **Processing** - The robot's brain (computer chip) makes decisions based on sensor information
  - **Output** - Motors and other parts respond based on those decisions

## Sensors (Input Components)
- **Types of sensors and what they detect:**
  - Light sensors - detect differences between light and dark (like lines)
  - Ultrasonic sensors - measure distance to objects
  - Infrared sensors - detect objects at a distance
  - Color sensors - identify different colors
  - Accelerometers - detect orientation and movement
  - Gyroscopes - detect rotation and direction
  - Soil moisture sensors - detect water levels in soil
  - Temperature sensors - measure heat levels

## Actuators (Output Components)
- **Types of actuators:**
  - DC motors - provide continuous rotation (good for wheels)
  - Servo motors - move to precise positions (good for robot arms)
  - Stepper motors - move in exact increments (good for precise positioning)
  - Solenoids - create straight line motion (pushing/pulling)
  - Speakers, lights, displays - provide feedback or information

## Design Parameters and Constraints
- **Design parameters** are measurable goals a robot needs to meet:
  - Maximum speed
  - Battery life
  - Weight capacity
  - Navigation accuracy

- **Design constraints** are limitations to work within:
  - Budget
  - Size
  - Weight
  - Time
  - Available materials

## Safety Features
- **Physical safety features:**
  - Rounded edges instead of sharp corners
  - Speed limitations
  - Weight distribution to prevent tipping
  - Emergency stop buttons
  - Protective covers over moving parts

- **Operational safety features:**
  - Obstacle detection systems
  - Battery level monitoring
  - Fail-safe behaviors
  - Testing procedures

## Privacy Considerations
- Collect only necessary data
- Be transparent about information collection
- Store data securely
- Delete data when no longer needed
- Provide user control over data collection

## Accessibility Features
- Multiple interaction methods (voice, touch, visual)
- Clear, simple language
- Tactile indicators on buttons
- Visual and audio feedback
- Adjustable settings
