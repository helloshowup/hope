# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Collaborative Testing Approaches
- "Fresh eyes" testing involves asking someone who hasn't seen your robot before to try using it
- Role-playing means taking on different roles yourself (builder, tester, user)
- Structured testing protocols include:
  - Function testing (testing each part separately)
  - Boundary testing (testing extreme conditions)
  - Failure testing (creating problems intentionally)
- Test documentation should include:
  - What was tested
  - How it was tested
  - What worked well
  - What problems were found
  - How problems were fixed

## Documentation and Presentation
- Documentation helps track progress, remember what you did, and share work with others
- Documentation tells the story of your robot from first idea to final design

## Design Portfolio Development
- A design portfolio shows your entire robot design journey
- Portfolio contents should include:
  - Problem statement and requirements
  - Research done before starting
  - Sketches and diagrams of initial ideas
  - Final design plans
  - Photos or drawings of different construction stages
  - Programming code with comments
  - Test results and data
  - Changes made based on testing
  - Final evaluation

## Evidence Collection and Organization
- Evidence collection techniques include:
  - Taking "before and after" photos
  - Recording video clips of the robot in action
  - Keeping all versions of programming code
  - Creating data tables for test results
  - Saving failed designs
  - Using consistent naming systems for files

## Presentation Techniques
- Presentation elements include:
  - Clear introduction explaining the challenge
  - Visual aids (photos, videos, diagrams)
  - Story about the design process
  - Demonstration of the robot in action
  - Explanation of what was learned
  - Organized and focused content
