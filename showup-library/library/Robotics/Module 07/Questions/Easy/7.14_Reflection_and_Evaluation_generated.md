# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Concepts and Definitions
- Self-assessment means evaluating your own work honestly
- Evaluation helps you become a better designer for future projects
- Professional engineers rarely get everything perfect on the first try
- The goal of self-assessment is to understand what you did well and what you could do better

## Self-Assessment Methods
- Requirements checklist: checking if your robot meets all original requirements
- Success criteria evaluation: testing your robot against each success criterion
- Design journal review: looking back through notes and documentation
- Strengths and weaknesses analysis: listing what worked well and what could be improved
- Learning reflection: identifying important things learned during the project

## Peer Review Processes
- Guided demonstration: showing your robot to someone else and explaining how it works
- Feedback forms: creating forms with questions about different aspects of your robot
- "I like, I wish, I wonder" format: a structured way to get feedback
- Expert consultation: showing your robot to someone with experience in robotics

## Future Improvement Identification
- Performance gap analysis: comparing actual performance to ideal goals
- "If only..." brainstorming: completing "This robot would be better if only..."
- Constraint removal: considering improvements if limitations were removed
- Next version planning: sketching "Version 2.0" of your robot
- Technology watch: researching newer technologies or techniques
- Improvement priority matrix: a four-box grid to prioritize improvements

## Learning Objectives
- Ways to check your own robot design
- Methods to get useful tips from others
- Approaches to make your robot better
