# Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Design Process vs. Trial-and-Error Approaches

### Comparing Approaches
- How systematic design and trial-and-error differ in robotics applications
- When each approach is most appropriate in the design cycle
- How to integrate both approaches effectively in a project

### Drawbacks of Trial-and-Error
- How trial-and-error makes tracking changes and results difficult
- Why focusing on immediate fixes without understanding root causes is problematic
- How trial-and-error can waste limited resources (time, materials, budget)
- The relationship between random changes and learning opportunities

### Advantages of Systematic Design
- How systematic design provides structure for complex projects with multiple components
- Why documentation throughout the process benefits current and future projects
- How controlled testing provides more reliable data about performance
- The relationship between systematic design and professional engineering practices

### Choosing the Right Approach
- How to determine which approach fits different project phases
- Why complex projects benefit from systematic approaches
- When elements of trial-and-error might be appropriate:
  - During ideation and exploration phases
  - For calibration and fine-tuning
  - For learning about unfamiliar components

### Combining Structure with Creativity
- How the engineering design process channels creativity rather than limiting it
- Techniques for creative thinking within a structured approach:
  - Brainstorming without immediate judgment
  - Using "what if" questions to challenge assumptions
  - Looking to nature for design inspiration
  - Combining different ideas into new solutions

### Roomba Case Study Analysis
- How iRobot balanced competing goals (cleaning effectiveness vs. battery life)
- Why the team chose a round shape over other options
- The reasoning behind random movement patterns versus systematic grid patterns
- How testing revealed the need for specific features (bin indicators, self-emptying)
- Ways the team adapted their design based on real-world testing

### Design Process Application
- How each phase of the design process contributed to the Roomba's success
- The relationship between thorough research and avoiding reinvention
- Why multiple prototypes were essential to the development process
- How continuous testing in real conditions differs from laboratory testing
