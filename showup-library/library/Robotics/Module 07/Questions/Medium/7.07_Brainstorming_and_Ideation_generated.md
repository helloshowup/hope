# MEDIUM-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Structured Brainstorming Techniques
- How mind mapping connects and organizes robot design ideas:
  - Starting with the main problem in the center and branching outward
  - Creating hierarchical relationships between main concepts and details
  - Visualizing connections between different design elements
- How mind maps support the design process:
  - Making relationships between ideas visible
  - Organizing thoughts systematically
  - Facilitating the discovery of new solution pathways

## Balancing Structure and Creativity
- Processes for effective brainstorming:
  - Starting with unconstrained ideation before applying constraints
  - Alternating between different ideation methods to stimulate thinking
  - Using visual representation to clarify and communicate ideas
  - Implementing strategic breaks to overcome mental blocks
  - Identifying valuable elements in seemingly impractical ideas
- Why the combination of creativity and organization produces better designs

## Creative Thinking Methods
- Application of biomimicry in robotics:
  - Using natural mechanisms as inspiration for robot components
  - Analyzing how natural systems solve similar problems
- Problem inversion technique:
  - Reformulating problems from different perspectives
  - How changing the question leads to different solution paths
- Assumption challenging:
  - Identifying and questioning established design constraints
  - How challenging assumed requirements leads to innovation

## Collaborative Ideation
- Comparative effectiveness of different group brainstorming techniques:
  - Round-robin brainstorming for equal participation
  - Brainwriting for preventing dominant voices
  - "Yes, and..." building for constructive idea development
- Implementation principles for effective collaboration:
  - Establishing ground rules that encourage participation
  - Deferring judgment during ideation phases
  - Building on ideas rather than competing
  - Documentation processes for capturing all contributions
  - Leveraging diverse perspectives for more robust solutions
- How collaboration produces solutions that individuals might not develop alone

## Developing Evaluation Criteria
- Characteristics of effective evaluation criteria:
  - Clarity and shared understanding
  - Measurability and testability
  - Relevance to the problem
  - Comprehensiveness across important factors
- Categories of evaluation criteria for robotics:
  - Feasibility assessment
  - Performance metrics
  - Resource requirements
  - User interface considerations
  - Reliability and durability factors

## Using Decision Matrices
- Process for creating and using decision matrices:
  - Structuring comparisons across multiple solutions
  - Weighting criteria based on relative importance
  - Scoring solutions against weighted criteria
  - Calculating weighted scores to determine optimal solutions
- Methods for resolving tied scores:
  - Adding discriminating criteria
  - Prototyping competing solutions
  - Hybrid approaches combining elements from multiple solutions
- How decision matrices transform subjective preferences into objective comparisons
