## Self-Assessment Methods
- How to effectively evaluate your own robot design:
  - Using a requirements checklist to assess whether your robot fully, partially, or doesn't meet each requirement
  - Evaluating your robot against success criteria using rating scales
  - Reviewing design journal entries to analyze key decisions and their outcomes
  - Conducting strengths and weaknesses analysis across different aspects (structure, programming, sensors)

## Peer Review Processes
- Methods for gathering constructive feedback:
  - Guided demonstration techniques with specific questions for reviewers
  - Implementing feedback forms with ratings and comment sections
  - Using the "I like, I wish, I wonder" format to structure feedback
