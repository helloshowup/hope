# HARD-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Complex System Relationships
- The integration between engineering design process and input-processing-output framework represents a systems thinking approach
  - The frameworks are complementary rather than separate methodologies
  - Each design step involves consideration of multiple I-P-O elements simultaneously
  - The iterative nature of both frameworks creates feedback loops that enhance design quality

## Critical Design Decisions
- Trade-offs between sensor accuracy and system complexity during input selection
- Evaluation of different processing algorithms based on efficiency, reliability, and adaptability
- Assessment of output mechanisms for precision, power consumption, and environmental impact

## Abstract Design Principles
- The concept of "sufficient sensing" - determining the minimum sensor array needed for reliable operation
- Decision boundaries in processing systems that determine robot behavior in edge cases
- Feedback mechanisms where outputs influence future inputs, creating self-regulating systems

## Predictive Design Elements
- Anticipating how environmental variations might affect sensor reliability
- Predicting potential failure modes in processing systems under unexpected conditions
- Forecasting how output mechanisms might degrade over time and designing compensatory measures

## Evaluative Judgments
- Assessing the ethical implications of autonomous decision-making in robotic systems
- Evaluating the sustainability of different design approaches in terms of resource use
- Analyzing the scalability of designs from prototypes to production systems

## System Integration Challenges
- The complex relationship between sensor placement and the quality of decision-making
- How processing latency affects real-time response capabilities in dynamic environments
- The implications of output precision on overall system performance and reliability
