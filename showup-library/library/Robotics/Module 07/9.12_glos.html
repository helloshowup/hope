<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A set of step-by-step instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Just like you follow a recipe to bake cookies, robots follow algorithms to navigate around obstacles.</p>
<h2>Automation</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  When machines do tasks that people used to do, often making the process faster or more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Self-checkout machines at grocery stores are a form of automation that lets customers scan their own items.</p>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  When a robot treats some people differently than others because of how it was programmed or what data it learned from.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If a robot only recognizes certain faces because it wasn't trained with diverse pictures, that's bias.</p>
<h2>Cloud Storage</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Saving information on internet servers instead of inside the robot itself, allowing access from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When your robot vacuum sends maps of your home to the company's servers, it's using cloud storage.</p>
<h2>Collision Detection</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Technology that helps robots sense when they're about to bump into something or someone.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your robot vacuum uses collision detection to avoid crashing into furniture or falling down stairs.</p>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Getting permission from people before collecting their information or interacting with them.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot should ask before taking your picture or recording your voice, just like a friend would.</p>
<h2>Data Breach</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  When private information collected by a robot is stolen or accidentally shared with unauthorized people.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If hackers break into a company's computers and steal robot camera footage from people's homes, that's a data breach.</p>
<h2>Data Minimization</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The practice of collecting only the information a robot absolutely needs to do its job.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot vacuum only needs to map your floors, not record conversations or take photos of people.</p>
<h2>Emergency Stop Button</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A button that immediately shuts down a robot if there's a problem or danger.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If a robot arm starts moving unpredictably in science class, you can press the big red emergency stop button.</p>
<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A way to scramble information so only authorized people can read it, like a secret code.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When you send a private message to a friend, encryption keeps others from reading it, just like a secret language.</p>
<h2>Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The study of right and wrong that helps us decide how robots should behave and be designed.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Ethics helps us decide if a delivery robot should prioritize speed or safety when navigating crowded sidewalks.</p>
<h2>Fail-safe</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A backup system that activates when something goes wrong with a robot to prevent accidents or harm.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If a robot's main computer stops working, a fail-safe might automatically shut down all moving parts.</p>
<h2>Force-sensing Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Sensors that let robots feel how much pressure they're applying when touching or gripping objects.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot with force-sensing can hold an egg without breaking it or shake your hand without squeezing too hard.</p>
<h2>Inclusive Design</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Creating robots that everyone can use regardless of their abilities, language, or background.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot with both voice commands and buttons works for people who can see, hear, or do both.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Information that robots collect from their environment through sensors, cameras, or microphones.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When you speak to a voice assistant, your words are the input it uses to understand your request.</p>
<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Saving information inside the robot itself instead of sending it to internet servers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot that keeps your voice commands stored only in its own memory is using local storage.</p>
<h2>Motion Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Restrictions built into robots that prevent them from moving too quickly or into unsafe areas.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A classroom robot has motion limitations so it moves slowly around students and can't reach dangerous heights.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Actions that robots take in the world, like moving, making sounds, or displaying information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When a robot vacuum changes direction after hitting a wall, that movement is an output.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The right to control what personal information is collected and shared about you.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot shouldn't record video in your bedroom without permission because that would violate your privacy.</p>
<h2>Privacy-by-Design</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Building privacy protections into robots from the beginning instead of adding them later.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot designed with privacy in mind might have a light that shows when its camera is recording.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  How robots analyze information and make decisions based on what their sensors detect.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When a robot vacuum sees a stain through its camera, processing helps it decide to clean that area more thoroughly.</p>
<h2>Purpose Limitation</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Using data only for the specific reason it was collected, not for other unexpected uses.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If a robot collects your voice to follow commands, it shouldn't also analyze your mood without permission.</p>
<h2>Redundant Systems</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Having backup parts or programs that take over if the main ones fail, making robots safer.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Airplanes have multiple computers doing the same job so if one breaks, the others keep working.</p>
<h2>Robot Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Rules and principles for designing robots that help people and don't cause harm.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Robot ethics helps designers decide if a delivery robot should prioritize speed or pedestrian safety.</p>
<h2>Safety Certification</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Official approval showing a robot has passed tests proving it's safe to use.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Before a robot toy can be sold in stores, it needs safety certification to prove it won't hurt children.</p>
<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Devices that help robots detect things in their environment, like light, sound, or movement.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your phone uses a light sensor to make the screen brighter when you're outside in the sun.</p>
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  All the different people who might be affected by a robot, including users, bystanders, and helpers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  For a school robot, stakeholders include students, teachers, janitors, and visitors who interact with it.</p>
<h2>Three Laws of Robotics</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Famous rules created by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how robots should behave safely around humans.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Asimov's first law states that a robot may not harm a human or allow a human to be harmed.</p>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Being clear and honest about what a robot is doing, how it works, and what information it collects.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot with good transparency has a light that turns on whenever it's recording video.</p>
<h2>User Control</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Giving people choices about how robots work and what information they collect.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Good user control lets you easily turn off a robot's microphone when you want privacy.</p>
<h2>Visual Data</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Information robots collect through cameras, helping them see and navigate their environment.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot vacuum uses visual data to create maps of your home and avoid bumping into furniture.</p>
