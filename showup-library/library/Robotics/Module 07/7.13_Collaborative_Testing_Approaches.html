<h1>Collaborative Testing Approaches</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test your robot using team methods even when working alone</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Create a design folder that shows your robot's story</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Give a clear talk about your robot project</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if you're working alone, you can use collaborative testing approaches to improve your robot design. These methods help you find and fix problems more effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Fresh eyes" testing: Ask someone who hasn't seen your robot before to try using it or watching it perform. They might notice issues you've missed.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Role-playing: Take on different roles yourself - be the builder, then the tester, then the user. Each perspective helps you see different aspects of your design.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Structured testing protocols:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Function testing: Test each part of your robot separately before testing the whole system</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Boundary testing: Try the extreme conditions (fastest speed, tightest turns, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Failure testing: Intentionally create problems to see how your robot handles them</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Document all test results, including:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What you tested</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How you tested it</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What worked well</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What problems you found</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How you fixed the problems</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good testing is systematic and thorough. Don't just check if your robot works in ideal conditions - test it in all the conditions it might face during the challenge.</p>
<h2>Documentation and Presentation</h2><p>Documenting your robot design process is just as important as building the robot itself! Good documentation helps you track your progress, remember what you did, and share your work with others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think of documentation as telling the story of your robot - from the first idea to the final design.</p>
<h2>Design Portfolio Development</h2><p>A design portfolio is a collection of materials that shows your entire robot design journey. It's like a scrapbook of your project that helps others understand what you did and why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your portfolio should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The problem statement and requirements for your robot challenge</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Research you did before starting (including any similar robots you looked at)</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Sketches and diagrams of your initial design ideas</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Final design plans with detailed explanations</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Photos or drawings of your robot at different stages of construction</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Programming code with comments explaining how it works</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Test results and data you collected</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Changes you made based on testing</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Final evaluation of how well your robot met the requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organize your portfolio in chronological order, from beginning to end. Use dividers or sections with clear labels to make it easy to find specific information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A good portfolio shows not just what you built, but how your thinking evolved throughout the project.</p>
<h2>Evidence Collection and Organization</h2><p>Collecting and organizing evidence of your design process helps prove what you did and why you made certain decisions. Here are effective techniques for gathering evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take "before and after" photos whenever you make significant changes to your robot.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Record short video clips of your robot in action, especially during testing.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Keep all versions of your programming code, not just the final version.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Create data tables to record test results. For example:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Test #1: Robot speed on smooth surface = 10 inches/second</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Test #2: Robot speed on rough surface = 7 inches/second</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Save failed designs and explain why they didn't work. Learning from mistakes is an important part of the design process!</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Use a consistent naming system for all files and documents (for example: "LineFollower_Test3_April15.mp4").</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organize your evidence by design phase (planning, building, testing, etc.) or by robot component (structure, sensors, programming, etc.). Choose the system that makes the most sense for your project.</p>
<h2>Presentation Techniques</h2><p>Presenting your robot design effectively helps others understand and appreciate your work. Here are strategies for creating engaging presentations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a clear introduction that explains the challenge and why it matters.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Use visual aids like photos, videos, and diagrams to show your robot and how it works.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Tell a story about your design process, including:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The problem you were trying to solve</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Challenges you faced along the way</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Aha moments" when you figured something out</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How you tested and improved your design</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate your robot in action if possible. If not, show video of it working.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Explain what you learned and what you would do differently next time.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Keep your presentation organized and focused on the most important points.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Practice your presentation beforehand so you can speak confidently.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember that a good presentation doesn't just show that your robot works - it shows your understanding of the design process and the decisions you made along the way.</p>
