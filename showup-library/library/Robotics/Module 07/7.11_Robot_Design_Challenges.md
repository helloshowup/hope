- Pick the best robot challenge for your skill level
- List the key parts needed for different robot tasks
- Create a clear plan for your robot design

## Lesson Podcast Discussion: Applying the Engineering Design Process to Robotics Challenges
This podcast explores how the engineering design process provides a structured framework for approaching complex robot challenges, from initial problem definition to final solution evaluation.

## Challenge Selection and Analysis

When engineers build robots, they start by understanding the problem they need to solve. In this section, we'll look at different robot challenges you can choose from to practice the engineering design process.

Each challenge requires different robot capabilities, so you'll need to think carefully about what your robot needs to do. Remember that a well-defined problem makes finding a solution much easier!

## Line-Following Challenge

A line-following robot needs to track and follow a line drawn on the ground. This challenge tests your robot's ability to "see" using light sensors and make quick decisions about direction.

Your robot will need sensors to detect the difference between the line (usually black) and the background (usually white). The robot must stay on the line even when it curves or makes sharp turns. You'll need to program your robot to adjust its wheels or motors based on what the sensors detect.

Success in this challenge means your robot can follow the entire line without losing track or going off course. This is similar to how self-driving cars follow lane markings on roads!

## Obstacle Course Challenge

In the obstacle course challenge, your robot must navigate through a path with various barriers and terrain changes. This tests your robot's ability to sense its environment and make decisions about how to move safely.

Your robot might need to go around walls, climb small ramps, or squeeze through narrow passages. You'll need to think about what sensors your robot needs (like distance sensors or touch sensors) and how to program it to respond when it detects an obstacle.

This challenge is similar to how robots in warehouses or on other planets need to move around without bumping into things or getting stuck.

## Object Sorting Challenge

The object sorting challenge asks your robot to identify different objects and sort them into the correct categories. For example, your robot might need to separate blue blocks from red blocks, or put small objects in one pile and large objects in another.

Your robot will need sensors to detect color, size, or shape. It will also need a way to pick up and move objects, like a gripper arm or scoop. You'll program your robot to make decisions based on what it senses and then take action to sort each object correctly.

This challenge is similar to how recycling robots sort different materials or how factory robots organize products.

## Custom Challenge Design

If you have your own robot challenge idea, you can create a custom challenge! The key is to clearly define what problem your robot will solve and how you'll know if it succeeds.

When designing your own challenge, think about:
- What specific task will your robot perform?
- What environment will it operate in?
- What would count as success?
- What limitations or rules should apply?

Creating your own challenge lets you focus on problems that interest you most, whether that's a robot that can play a simple game, care for a plant, or solve another problem you've identified.

## Activity 1: Challenge Selection and Problem Definition

Select one of the robot challenges presented (or design your own) and develop a comprehensive problem statement. Define the specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria for your chosen challenge. Create a simple diagram illustrating the challenge environment and key elements your robot must interact with.

## Coming Up Next: From Blueprint to Reality
Now that you've created your detailed robot design plan and established your success criteria, it's time to bring your ideas to life! In the next section, we'll dive into implementation and testing strategies that will help you transform your careful planning into a working robot. You'll learn effective approaches for managing your materials, developing realistic timelines, and testing your robot throughout the building processâ€”not just at the end. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and start building, while using smart testing strategies to continuously improve your robot's performance.
