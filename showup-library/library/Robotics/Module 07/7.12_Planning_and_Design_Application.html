<h1>Planning and Design Application</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a step-by-step plan for your robot design</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Set clear goals to test if your robot works well</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make a timeline to keep your project on track
Once you've selected your challenge and defined the problem, it's time to create a detailed plan for your robot. Good planning saves time and helps you avoid problems later in the design process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think of this stage like drawing a blueprint before building a house - you want to work out all the details on paper before you start building!</p>
<h2>Creating Comprehensive Challenge Plans</h2><p>A good robot design plan includes details about all the parts of your robot and why you chose them. Start by sketching what your robot will look like from different angles. Label all the important parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For each component of your robot, explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>What it does (its function)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why you chose it (your reasoning)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How it connects to other parts</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if you're building a line-following robot, your plan might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two motors: To control the wheels independently so the robot can turn</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Light sensors: To detect the line on the ground</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A controller board: To run your program and connect all parts</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wheels: To move the robot smoothly on the surface</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Include measurements and specific details whenever possible. This makes it easier to build exactly what you planned.</p>
<h2>Setting Success Criteria</h2><p>Success criteria are specific goals that help you know if your robot works well. These should be measurable and directly related to your challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good success criteria answer the question: "How will I know if my robot is successful?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, success criteria for a line-following robot might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The robot follows the entire line without going off track</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The robot completes the course in less than 2 minutes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The robot can handle curves with at least a 4-inch radius</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The robot can recover if it briefly loses the line</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write down your success criteria before you start building. This gives you clear targets to aim for and helps you test your robot fairly.</p>
<h2>Project Management Approaches</h2><p>Managing your robot project means organizing your time, materials, and tasks effectively. Even professional engineers use project management tools to stay organized!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some strategies to help manage your robot design project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a timeline with specific deadlines for each stage:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Research and planning: 2 days</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Building the robot: 3 days</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Programming: 2 days</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Testing and improvements: 3 days</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Make a materials list with everything you'll need before you start building.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Break down big tasks into smaller steps. Instead of "build robot," list steps like "attach wheels to motors" and "connect sensors to controller."</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Keep a project journal where you record what you did each day, problems you faced, and how you solved them.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using these project management approaches will help you stay organized and make steady progress toward completing your robot challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>7.13 Implementation and Testing Strategies</h1><p>Now that we've completed our planning, it's time to build and test your robot design! This is where your plans come to life, but it's also where you'll discover things that need to be fixed or improved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember that testing is not just something you do at the end - it should happen throughout the building process to catch problems early.</p>
<h2>Resources and Materials Management</h2><p>Managing your resources and materials effectively is crucial for a successful robot project. Here's how to do it well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a complete inventory of all parts and materials you need before starting. Group them by category (electronics, structural parts, tools, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Check what materials you already have and what you need to get. Sometimes you can substitute one material for another if needed.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Set up a clean, organized workspace with enough room to build and test your robot. Keep similar items together and label containers if possible.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Handle delicate components with care. For example, electronic parts can be damaged by static electricity, and some sensors need to be kept clean.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Reuse and recycle materials when possible. Many robot parts can be taken apart and used in future projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good resource management means you won't waste time looking for parts or run out of essential materials halfway through your project.</p>
<h2>Timeline Development</h2><p>Creating a realistic timeline helps you complete your robot project on schedule. Here's how to develop an effective timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with the final deadline and work backward.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Divide your project into phases:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Planning phase: Research and design (20% of total time)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Building phase: Constructing the physical robot (30% of total time)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Programming phase: Writing and testing code (20% of total time)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Testing phase: Evaluating and improving (20% of total time)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Documentation phase: Recording your process (10% of total time)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Set specific milestones to check your progress. For example:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Day 3: Complete robot chassis construction</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Day 5: Finish basic movement programming</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Day 7: Robot successfully completes basic version of challenge</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Include buffer time for unexpected problems. Things almost always take longer than expected!</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Create a visual timeline chart and keep it visible in your workspace to stay on track.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember that your timeline might need adjustments as you work, and that's okay. The goal is to have a plan that helps you manage your time effectively.</p>

<li>A successful robot design requires detailed planning with sketches, component explanations, and measurable success criteria before building begins.</li>
<li>Breaking your robot project into smaller tasks, creating a timeline with specific deadlines, and maintaining an organized workspace helps you manage your project effectively.</li>
<li>Testing should happen throughout the building process, not just at the end, with buffer time included in your schedule for unexpected problems and improvements.</li>

<h1>7.14 Coming Up Next: Telling Your Robot's Story</h1><p>In the next section, we'll explore collaborative testing approaches and the art of documenting your journey. You'll discover how to develop a comprehensive design portfolio that captures your entire process, collect and organize meaningful evidence of your work, and present your robot project in engaging ways. These documentation and presentation skills are critical for sharing your innovations with others and demonstrating not just what you built, but the thinking and problem-solving that went into every decision along the way.</p>
