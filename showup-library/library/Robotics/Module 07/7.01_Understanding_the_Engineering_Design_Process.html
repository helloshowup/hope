<h2>Introduction to Engineering Design</h2>

<h2>What is Engineering Design?</h2><p>Engineering design is a creative and organized way to solve problems and create solutions. Unlike random guessing or trying things without a plan, engineering design follows specific steps to find the best solution. Think of it like following a recipe when cooking instead of just throwing ingredients together and hoping for the best!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In robotics, engineering design helps us create robots that can successfully complete tasks, whether it's a robot that can navigate a maze, pick up objects, or even explore other planets. Engineers use this process to turn ideas into real, working robots that solve specific problems.</p>
<h3>The Five Steps of Engineering Design</h3><p>The engineering design process typically follows these five main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define the Problem</strong> - Clearly state what problem needs to be solved</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research &amp; Brainstorm</strong> - Gather information and come up with possible solutions</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Plan &amp; Design</strong> - Select the best solution and create detailed plans</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build &amp; Test</strong> - Create a prototype and see if it works</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improve</strong> - Make changes based on testing results and try again</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    </h3><p> Can you think of a problem in your daily life that could be solved using these five steps? What would each step look like for that problem?</p>

<h2>Why a Systematic Approach Matters</h2><p>Using a systematic approach to design is like using a map when traveling to a new place â€“ it helps you reach your destination more efficiently and with fewer wrong turns. When building robots, a systematic approach helps in several important ways:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, it saves time and resources. By planning before building, you avoid wasting materials on ideas that won't work. Second, it helps you consider multiple solutions instead of getting stuck on your first idea. Third, it makes troubleshooting easier because you can track what you've tried and what changes you've made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, imagine trying to build a robot that can follow a line on the floor. Without a systematic approach, you might keep changing different parts randomly when it doesn't work. With a systematic approach, you'd carefully test each component (sensors, motors, programming) to identify exactly what needs improvement.</p>

<h2>Engineering Design in Robotics</h2><p>In robotics, the engineering design process is especially important because robots are complex systems with many interacting parts. When designing robots, engineers must consider mechanical components (like wheels or arms), electronic systems (like sensors and motors), and programming (the instructions that tell the robot what to do).</p>
<h3>Real-World Example: Mars Rovers</h3><p>When engineers at NASA designed the Mars rovers, they had to solve problems like how to land safely on Mars, how to move across rough terrain, how to gather scientific data, and how to communicate that information back to Earth. Each of these challenges required careful application of the engineering design process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, to solve the problem of moving across Mars' rocky surface, engineers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Defined the problem</strong>: Create a wheel system that can handle rough terrain</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Researched</strong>: Studied Mars' surface conditions and different wheel designs</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Selected and designed special wheels with gripping surfaces</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Built and tested</strong>: Created prototypes and tested them in Mars-like conditions</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improved</strong>: Made adjustments based on test results until the wheels worked properly</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even simpler robots, like a basic line-following robot you might build in class, benefit from this process. You'll need to decide what sensors to use, how to mount them, how to program the robot to respond to sensor readings, and how to adjust the robot's speed for accurate line following. The engineering design process gives you a framework to tackle each of these decisions in a logical order.</p>
