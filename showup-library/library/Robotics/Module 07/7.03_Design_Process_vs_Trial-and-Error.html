<h1>Design Process vs. Trial-and-Error</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the key facts about design process and trial-and-error when making robots</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List at least three ways a design process helps build better robots</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pick when to use a plan and when to try things out in a robot project</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When building robots, there are different ways to approach the challenge. Imagine you're trying to build a robot that can navigate through a maze. You could just start putting parts together, test it in the maze, and keep changing things until it works. That's the trial-and-error approach. Or, you could carefully plan out your robot first - thinking about what sensors it needs, how it should move, and drawing diagrams before building anything. That's using a design process. Both approaches have their place, but knowing when to use each one can make a huge difference in how successful your robot project will be!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This section compares structured design approaches with less formal methods.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks of Trial-and-Error Approaches</h2><p>While trial-and-error can sometimes lead to solutions, it has significant drawbacks when working on complex projects like robotics. First, it's often inefficient and time-consuming. Without a plan, you might make the same mistakes repeatedly or miss obvious solutions because you're changing things randomly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, trial-and-error makes it difficult to track what you've tried and what worked. Imagine changing five different things on your robot at once – if performance improves, you won't know which change actually helped! This makes learning from the process nearly impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Third, trial-and-error typically focuses on fixing immediate problems rather than understanding the underlying causes. For example, if your robot keeps veering left, a trial-and-error approach might involve adjusting the right wheel speed without investigating why the imbalance exists in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, with limited resources (time, materials, budget), trial-and-error can be wasteful. Building multiple versions without planning might use up all your materials before you find a working solution.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Using a Systematic Design Process</h2><p>A systematic design approach offers numerous advantages over trial-and-error. First, it provides a clear roadmap that helps you stay organized and focused throughout the project. This structure is especially helpful when working on complex robots with many interacting systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, systematic design encourages thorough research and consideration of multiple solutions before building. This broader perspective often leads to more innovative and effective designs than simply trying the first idea that comes to mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Third, the testing phase in systematic design is deliberate and controlled. You create specific tests to evaluate how well your robot meets the requirements, which gives you reliable data about performance. This makes it easier to identify exactly what needs improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fourth, systematic design creates documentation throughout the process – problem definitions, research findings, design plans, test results, and improvement notes. This documentation is valuable for current troubleshooting and for future projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the systematic approach mirrors how professional engineers work in the real world. Learning this process now prepares you for more advanced projects and potential careers in engineering and robotics.</p>
<h2>Choosing the Right Approach for Your Robot Project</h2><p>While systematic design is generally superior for robotics projects, there are situations where elements of trial-and-error can be useful. Understanding when to use each approach is an important skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Systematic design works best for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex projects with multiple components</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Situations with limited resources or time</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Team projects where communication is essential</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Problems where safety or reliability is critical</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Projects that will be documented or shared with others</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elements of trial-and-error might be appropriate for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick explorations during the ideation phase</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simple adjustments during fine-tuning (like calibrating a sensor)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Learning about an unfamiliar component to see how it works</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Situations where the cost of failure is very low</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In practice, many successful robotics projects use a hybrid approach – following the systematic design process overall while incorporating small, controlled experiments when appropriate. The key is being intentional about when you're exploring freely versus when you're following a structured plan.</p>
<h2>Combining Structure with Creative Thinking</h2><p>While the engineering design process provides structure, it's important to remember that creativity is still a vital part of engineering! The best robot designs come from combining systematic approaches with creative thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the "Research and Ideate" phase especially, try these techniques to boost creativity while staying organized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorming sessions where you generate ideas without judging them first</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"What if" questions that challenge assumptions (What if the robot moved differently? What if we used a different sensor?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looking at nature for inspiration (How do animals solve similar problems?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Combining different ideas to create new solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, when engineers designed the Mars rover Curiosity, they needed a creative solution for landing the large rover safely. They came up with the "sky crane" system - a completely new approach where the descent vehicle hovered above the surface and lowered the rover down on cables. This creative solution came from a structured design process that identified the specific problem (traditional landing methods wouldn't work for a rover this size) and encouraged innovative thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remember that the engineering design process isn't meant to limit your creativity - it's meant to channel it effectively!</p>
<h2>Case Study: How the Roomba Was Designed</h2><p>Let's look at how the iRobot Roomba, the popular disc-shaped vacuum cleaning robot, was developed using the five steps of the engineering design process.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Define the Problem</h3><p>The engineers at iRobot identified a clear problem: people dislike vacuuming and often don't do it as frequently as needed for clean homes. They asked: "How can we create a robot that automatically cleans floors with minimal human intervention?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The requirements they defined included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The robot must clean effectively on different floor surfaces</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It must operate without human control</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It must avoid falling down stairs or getting stuck</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It must be affordable enough for home use</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It must be simple enough for anyone to operate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Research</h3><p>The iRobot team conducted extensive research before building their first prototype:</p>
<ul>
<li>They studied how people vacuum their homes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They researched different cleaning mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They investigated various sensors that could help a robot navigate</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They looked at battery technologies to ensure adequate cleaning time</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They examined how other robots moved and navigated spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This research helped them understand what had already been tried and what technologies were available to solve their problem.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Ideate</h3><p>During the ideation phase, the team explored many different design possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different shapes for the robot (square, round, triangular)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Various movement patterns (random, systematic grid patterns, wall-following)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Different cleaning mechanisms (suction only, brushes, combination systems)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Navigation approaches (bumper sensors, infrared sensors, cameras)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After considering many options, they settled on a round design that could easily navigate around furniture and use a combination of brushes and suction for cleaning.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Build</h3><p>The team built many prototypes before arriving at the final Roomba design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early prototypes tested basic movement and navigation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Later versions added cleaning mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More advanced prototypes incorporated sensors for cliff detection (to avoid stairs)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Final prototypes included docking stations for recharging</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each prototype helped them learn what worked and what needed improvement.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Test and Improve</h3><p>Testing was crucial to the Roomba's development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers tested prototypes in mock home environments with different furniture arrangements</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They tested on various floor surfaces (carpet, hardwood, tile)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They measured cleaning effectiveness by seeing how much dirt was collected</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They observed how well the robot avoided obstacles and returned to its charging station</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They had real families test the robots in their homes to get feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on test results, they made many improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>They adjusted the cleaning brushes to pick up more dirt</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They improved the navigation algorithms to cover more floor area</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They enhanced the sensors to better detect obstacles</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They made the interface simpler for users</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overcoming Design Challenges</h3><p>Each design phase presented unique challenges:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Define:</strong> Initially, the team had to balance competing goals of thorough cleaning versus battery life. They decided that effective cleaning was the priority, even if it meant shorter run times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Research:</strong> Early research showed that existing robot navigation systems were too expensive for a consumer product. The team had to find simpler, more affordable solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ideate:</strong> The team debated between systematic cleaning patterns versus random movement. Testing showed that for home environments with furniture, a random pattern with wall-following actually cleaned more effectively than trying to follow a perfect grid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong> Early prototypes got stuck frequently. The round shape was chosen specifically to help the robot free itself when it encountered obstacles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Test:</strong> Testing revealed that users wanted to know when the bin was full. Later Roomba models added indicators and eventually self-emptying capabilities based on this feedback.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the Roomba's Development</h3><p>The Roomba's development shows how the systematic design process leads to successful products:</p>
<ol>
<li>By clearly defining the problem first, the team stayed focused on creating a robot that solved a real need.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Research helped them avoid reinventing solutions and learn from previous attempts.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The ideation phase allowed them to consider multiple approaches before committing to building prototypes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Building multiple prototypes let them test ideas without wasting resources on a single approach that might fail.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Continuous testing and improvement resulted in a product that actually worked in real homes, not just in laboratory conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If iRobot had used only trial-and-error, they might have created a robot that worked in some situations but failed in others. The systematic approach ensured they considered all aspects of the problem and created a comprehensive solution.</p>
