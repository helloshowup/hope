<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Select appropriate sensors based on a robot's information needs and environmental conditions</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Design basic algorithms and decision logic for robot problem-solving</span></li>

</ul>
<h2>Input Component Selection</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the Input-Processing-Output (IPO) model from our previous lesson, we can explore how to select and configure the right input components for your robot.</p>
<h3>Matching Sensors to Information Needs</h3>
<p>Think about sensors as the way your robot perceives its world. Each problem requires specific types of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your robot needs to follow a line, <strong>light sensors</strong> can detect the difference between the line and the background.</li>
<li>If your robot needs to avoid obstacles, <strong>ultrasonic or infrared distance sensors</strong> can measure object distances.</li>
<li>If your robot needs to identify colors, a <strong>color sensor</strong> would be essential.</li>
<li>If your robot needs to know which way is up or how it's moving, <strong>accelerometers and gyroscopes</strong> can provide that information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is to think about what information your robot needs to solve its specific problem. A robot that sorts recycling needs to identify different materials, while a robot that waters plants needs to detect soil moisture. By matching sensors to these information needs, we make sure our robot can "see" what it needs to see.</p>
<p>For example, a garden helper robot might use these sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil moisture sensors to know when plants need water</li>
<li>Light sensors to track sunlight levels</li>
<li>Temperature sensors to monitor growing conditions</li>
<li>Color sensors to identify ripe vegetables</li>
</ul>

            <p><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Consider a robot you might design to solve a real-world problem. What types of information would this robot need to gather from its environment, and what sensors would be most appropriate for collecting this data?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h3>Environmental Considerations for Sensors</h3>
<p>The environment where your robot operates affects sensor selection. Imagine using a regular camera in a dark room or a paper-based touch sensor in the rain - neither would work!</p>
<p>For outdoor robots, you need sensors that can handle sunlight, rain, dust, and temperature changes. Waterproof ultrasonic sensors might be better than infrared sensors that can be confused by bright sunlight. For robots in noisy factories, sound-based sensors might not work well, but vibration or proximity sensors could be perfect.</p>
<p>Even the surfaces matter. A line-following robot might work well on smooth floors but struggle on carpet where the line is harder to detect. By considering the specific conditions your robot will face, you can choose sensors that work in that environment.</p>
<h3>Sensor Placement and Configuration</h3>
<p>Where you place sensors on your robot is just as important as which sensors you choose. Think about how humans position our eyes, ears, and hands to best sense the world around us.</p>
<p>For a robot that needs to avoid obstacles, placing distance sensors at the front makes sense, but adding sensors to the sides and back provides a more complete view of the surroundings. A line-following robot needs its light sensors positioned close to the ground and over the line.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need multiple sensors of the same type. For example, two light sensors positioned side by side can help a line-following robot stay centered on the line. Three ultrasonic sensors pointing in different directions give a robot better awareness of obstacles than just one sensor pointing forward.</p>
<p>The height, angle, and spacing of sensors all affect what information the robot receives. Testing different configurations helps find the optimal placement for your specific robot's needs.</p>

            <p><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Think about the sensors on your smartphone or other devices you use daily. How is their position designed to gather information? How might changing their placement affect their performance?</p>

<h2>Processing Component Planning</h2>
<p>Once your robot can gather information through its sensors, it must process that information. This is where processing components come into play.</p>
<h3>Algorithm Development</h3>
<p><strong>Algorithms</strong> are step-by-step instructions that tell your robot how to process sensor data. You can consider algorithms similar to recipes that transform raw information into meaningful understanding.</p>
<p>For example, a simple algorithm for a line-following robot might be:
1. Read values from left and right light sensors
2. If the left sensor detects the line (sees black), turn right
3. If the right sensor detects the line, turn left
4. If both sensors detect the line, go straight
5. If neither sensor detects the line, make a larger turn to find the line again</p>
<p>More complex robots might use algorithms that combine data from multiple sensors. A robot that navigates a room might combine distance sensor readings with information from a digital compass to create a map of its surroundings.</p>
<p>The key is to start with simple algorithms and test them before adding complexity. Even sophisticated robots often use combinations of simple algorithms rather than one complicated one.</p>
<p>In algorithm development, balancing structure with creativity is valuable. A step-by-step approach helps your robot work consistently, but don't hesitate to experiment with new ideas! Some of the best robot designs come from trying unusual approaches. Robot designers for the Mars rovers created new navigation algorithms because no one had driven a robot on Mars before.</p>
<h3>Decision Logic Design</h3>
<p><strong>Decision logic</strong> determines how your robot chooses actions based on processed information. This resembles a flowchart of "if-then" statements that guide your robot's behavior.</p>
<p>For example, a plant-watering robot might use decision logic like:</p>
<ul>
<li>IF soil moisture is below 30%, THEN activate water pump for 5 seconds</li>
<li>IF soil moisture is between 30-60%, THEN check again in 6 hours</li>
<li>IF soil moisture is above 60%, THEN check again in 12 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Good decision logic anticipates different situations and provides clear instructions for each one. It's important to include what the robot should do in unexpected situations too. What if a sensor fails? What if the robot gets stuck? Adding safety conditions and fallback behaviors makes your robot more reliable.</p>
<p>Making a visual flowchart of your decision logic before programming can help you spot potential problems and confirm your robot will behave as expected in all situations.</p>
<h3>Programming Considerations</h3>
<p>After designing your algorithms and decision logic, you'll translate them into a programming language your robot understands. Different robots use different programming languages and environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block-based languages like Scratch or Blockly are great for beginners and provide a visual way to create programs</li>
<li>Text-based languages like Python or C++ offer more flexibility but require more coding knowledge</li>
<li>Some robot kits come with their own specialized programming environments</li>
</ul>
<p>For programming your robot, consider these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break your program into smaller functions that each handle one specific task</li>
<li>Add comments to explain what each part of your code does</li>
<li>Use variables with clear names that describe what they represent</li>
<li>Test small parts of your program before combining them into the full system</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that programming involves iteration - you'll test, adjust, and improve your code several times before it works as intended.</p>

            <p><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Think about a simple decision you made today (like choosing what to eat or wear). Could you break this decision down into an algorithm with clear if-then statements? How might a robot need to approach similar decisions?</p>
