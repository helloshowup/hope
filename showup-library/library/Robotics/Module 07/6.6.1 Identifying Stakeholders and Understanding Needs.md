# 6.6.1 Identifying Stakeholders and Understanding Needs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Identify at least three types of stakeholders for a robotics solution
- Conduct a basic needs assessment to determine must-have and nice-to-have features
- Prioritize stakeholder requirements based on importance and impact

## Identifying Stakeholders

Stakeholders are all the people who will be affected by your robotics solution. They might include users who will interact with your robot, people who benefit from its work, and even those who might have concerns about its operation.

To identify stakeholders, ask yourself questions like:

- Who will use the robot?
- Who will benefit from the robot's actions?
- Who might be worried about the robot operating in their space?
- Who will maintain or fix the robot?

For example, if you're designing a robot to help in a school cafeteria, stakeholders might include students, cafeteria staff, custodians, and school administrators.

## Understanding User Needs

After identifying stakeholders, it's important to discover what they truly need. This might involve:

- Talking with potential users
- Watching how things work now
- Sending out surveys
- Creating user personas (made-up characters that represent different types of users)

Understanding these needs helps your robot become useful and gain acceptance among the people it's designed to help.

## Needs Assessment

A needs assessment helps you understand and prioritize what your solution must address. This involves:

1. Gathering information about what stakeholders need through interviews, surveys, or observation
2. Distinguishing between "needs" (must-haves) and "wants" (nice-to-haves)
3. Prioritizing needs based on importance and impact

For example, if designing a robot to help in a classroom, you might discover that:

- Must-have: The robot needs to be quiet so it doesn't disrupt lessons
- Must-have: The robot must be safe around children
- Nice-to-have: The robot could have a friendly appearance
- Nice-to-have: The robot could respond to voice commands

When you prioritize needs, you can focus your design efforts on the most important aspects first, making sure your solution addresses what matters most.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a robot you might design for your school or home. Who would be the stakeholders? What needs might they have? Try listing at least three stakeholders and one need for each.

## Key Takeaways

- Stakeholders include everyone affected by your robotics solution, from direct users to maintenance staff, and identifying them helps make your design meet real needs.
- A thorough needs assessment distinguishes between must-have features (essential requirements) and nice-to-have features (desirable but optional), helping focus design priorities.
- Prioritizing stakeholder requirements based on importance and impact makes certain your robotics solution addresses the most critical needs first.
