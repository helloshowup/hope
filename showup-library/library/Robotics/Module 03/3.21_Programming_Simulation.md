## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- **Apply** programming concepts to solve robot navigation challenges
- **Create** sequences of commands to guide robots through obstacles
- **Test and refine** your solutions in a virtual environment

Building on our previous lessons about biomimicry, loops, conditions, and decision trees, we're now ready to put these concepts into practice through simulation. Simulations let us test our programming ideas before trying them on real robots.

## **Virtual Robot Navigation**

In this lesson, we'll focus on programming a virtual robot to navigate through an environment with obstacles. This is similar to how the biomimetic robots we studied earlier need to move through their surroundings, but in a controlled virtual space where we can practice our programming skills.

We'll create step-by-step instructions for our robot to follow. The robot will need to:
- Move forward in open spaces
- Turn to avoid obstacles
- Make decisions based on what its virtual sensors detect
- Reach a target destination efficiently

This type of navigation challenge is fundamental to robotics - whether it's a gecko-inspired climbing robot avoiding obstacles on a wall or a salamander-inspired robot finding its way along a shoreline.

## **Programming Tools**

To program our virtual robot, we'll use:

- **Directional commands**: forward, backward, left, right
- **Loops**: to repeat actions multiple times without writing the same code over and over
- **Conditionals**: if-then statements that help the robot make decisions based on its surroundings

These are the same programming structures we explored in our previous lessons, now applied to solve a practical navigation challenge.

**CHECKPOINT:** Before starting your simulation, think about how you would plan a path through a room with furniture. What steps would you take? How would you decide when to turn or go straight? How is this similar to programming a robot's movement?

## **Simulation Activity**

Next, you'll work with a **Robot Path Planner** simulation. You'll be given a grid-based environment with obstacles and a target location. Your job will be to program the robot to reach its destination safely and efficiently.

This simulation will help you understand how real robots are programmed to navigate their environments, whether they're inspired by animals like we learned in our biomimicry lesson or designed with more traditional engineering approaches.

As you work through the simulation, remember to:
1. Plan your approach before writing any commands
2. Test your solution step by step
3. Debug and refine your program if the robot doesn't reach its target
4. Look for patterns where loops might simplify your code

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Simulations** provide a safe environment to test robot programming before using real hardware
- **Navigation challenges** require combining movement commands, loops, and conditions to create effective robot behavior
- **Planning and testing** are essential parts of the programming process, helping you refine your solution
- The programming concepts we're learning apply to all types of robots, including the biomimetic examples we studied earlier

**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
**Programming Simulation: Robot Path Planner** where students create a sequence of movement commands to navigate a virtual robot through an obstacle course. For example, students could be given a grid-based environment with obstacles and a target location, then must use **directional commands** (forward, backward, left, right), **loops** to repeat actions, and **conditionals** to make decisions based on the robot's surroundings. This activity builds on our previous work with basic programming concepts while applying them to solve a practical navigation challenge.
