<h1>Programming Simulation</h1><p><strong>This lesson could be followed by this game:</strong>
Programming Simulation: Robot Path Planner where students create a sequence of movement commands to navigate a virtual robot through an obstacle course. For example, students could be given a grid-based environment with obstacles and a target location, then must use directional commands, loops, and conditionals to guide their robot successfully to the goal while avoiding obstacles.</p>
