<h1>Aquatic Robot Movement</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name two types of water robots and how they move</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explain how wave gliders use ocean waves to move forward</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List three real-world jobs that water robots can do</li>
</ul>
<h3>Surface Swimming Robots</h3><p>Robots that move on water surfaces come in many designs, each suited for different tasks. Some look like small boats with propellers or paddle wheels that push them forward. These are good for monitoring water quality in lakes or carrying sensors to collect weather data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other surface robots use a fascinating property of water called <strong>surface tension</strong> â€“ the same force that lets some insects walk on water. These lightweight robots can skitter across the water's surface without sinking. Some even use solar panels to power themselves, allowing them to work for weeks or months without needing to recharge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting surface swimmers are <strong>wave gliders</strong> that use the motion of waves to move forward without motors. They have underwater "wings" that capture wave energy, making them extremely energy-efficient for long missions like ocean monitoring or tracking whale migrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In real-world applications, surface swimming robots are already helping scientists study ocean health. The Liquid Robotics Wave Glider, for example, has traveled thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean collecting data about water temperature, pollution levels, and marine life. These robots can go places that would be too expensive or dangerous to send research ships, helping us learn more about our oceans while using very little energy.</p>
<h3>Underwater Propulsion Methods</h3><p>Underwater robots, often called <strong>submersibles</strong> or <strong>Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)</strong>, face different challenges than their surface cousins. Water is much denser than air, which makes movement harder but also provides buoyancy that can help with floating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many underwater robots use propellers similar to submarines or boats, but they need to be sealed against water pressure and protected from corrosion. Some deep-sea robots can withstand the crushing pressure of ocean depths greater than 20,000 feet below the surface!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Biomimetic</strong> (nature-imitating) underwater robots copy the movement of sea creatures. Some wiggle like fish, using a flexible tail fin to push through water efficiently. Others pulse like jellyfish or use multiple small fins like cuttlefish. These designs are often quieter and gentler than propeller systems, making them perfect for studying sensitive marine environments like coral reefs without disturbing wildlife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest underwater robots combine multiple sensors with their specialized movement systems. For example, the robot fish "SoFi" developed by MIT uses cameras to see underwater while its flexible tail helps it swim naturally among real fish. Its movements are so life-like that real fish don't swim away when it approaches, allowing scientists to study marine life up close without disturbing natural behaviors.</p>
