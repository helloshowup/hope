# **Introduction to Robot Movement**

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Tell why robots need to move
- Sort robots into moving and non-moving types
- Show how a robot's job affects how it moves

## **Lesson Podcast Discussion:** **Robot Movement as an Output Function**
A discussion exploring how robot movement serves as the crucial output response that allows robots to interact with and modify their environment.

## **Understanding Robot Movement**

Movement is one of the most fascinating aspects of robotics. When we see a robot move, we're witnessing its ability to change its position or the position of its parts to accomplish tasks. Think about it - without movement, many robots would simply be stationary computers!

Movement gives robots the power to interact with the world around them. Whether it's a robot arm assembling a car part, a drone delivering a package, or a robot vacuum cleaning your home, movement is what allows these machines to be useful in our daily lives.

The ability to move is what transforms a simple computer into a machine that can physically change its environment. This is why movement is considered such a fundamental part of what makes many robots truly robotic.

### **Why Robots Need to Move**

Robots need to move for many different reasons, all connected to their specific jobs or purposes. Here are some of the main reasons:

First, robots often need to move to complete **tasks**. A delivery robot must travel from one location to another. A manufacturing robot arm needs to reach, grab, and place objects. Even a simple educational robot like Sphero needs to roll around to draw shapes or navigate mazes.

Second, movement allows robots to **explore** and gather information about their surroundings. **Mars rovers** like Curiosity and Perseverance move across the Martian surface to study different areas and collect samples. **Robot vacuums** move around your home to find and clean dirty spots.

Third, movement enables robots to **adapt** to changing environments. **Search and rescue robots** need to navigate through disaster areas that may be constantly changing. **Agricultural robots** must move through fields with varying terrain and plant growth.

### **Moving vs. Non-Moving Robots**

Not all robots need to move to be useful. Some robots are designed to stay in one place, while others need mobility to fulfill their purpose.

**Stationary robots** include industrial robot arms that are fixed to a specific spot on a factory floor. These robots can move their arms and tools with incredible precision, but the base of the robot remains in place. Other examples include **automated teller machines (ATMs)**, which process banking transactions without needing to move locations, and some smart home devices like voice assistants.

**Moving robots**, on the other hand, change their location to perform their tasks. Examples include **self-driving cars**, **delivery drones**, **robot vacuums**, and **exploration robots**. Their ability to navigate through space is essential to their function. A delivery robot that couldn't move would be useless for its intended purpose!

The choice between a moving or non-moving design depends entirely on what the robot needs to accomplish. A **robot surgeon** needs precise arm movements but doesn't need to travel around the hospital. A **warehouse robot**, however, must be able to travel throughout the facility to retrieve items.

## **Key Takeaways**
- Robots move to complete **tasks**, explore their surroundings, and adapt to changing environments.
- Some robots are designed to stay in one place (like factory arms), while others need to move around (like delivery robots) to fulfill their purpose.
- A robot's movement capabilities directly connect to its job - the right type of movement helps the robot accomplish its specific tasks.
