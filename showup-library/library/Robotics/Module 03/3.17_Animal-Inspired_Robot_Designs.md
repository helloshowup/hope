## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Name how robots copy the way **insects** move
- Explain how **snake** and **dog robots** move like real animals
- Show how robots use **bird** and **fish** tricks to fly and swim

### **Insect-Inspired Robots**
Insects might be small, but they're movement superstars! With their six or more legs, insects can walk over almost any surface while staying balanced and stable. This has made them perfect inspiration for robots that need to navigate rough or uneven terrain.

The **RHex robot**, for example, uses six curved legs inspired by cockroaches to move across sand, rocks, and even climb stairs. By copying the way cockroaches coordinate their leg movements, RHex can maintain stability even when climbing over obstacles. Another example is the **Harvard Microrobotics Lab's RoboBee**, which mimics how bees move their wings to create tiny flying robots smaller than a paperclip!

Engineers particularly value insect designs because they're relatively simple compared to larger animals, yet incredibly effective. Many insect-inspired robots are being developed for **search and rescue missions**, where they need to crawl through tight spaces in collapsed buildings or navigate disaster areas too dangerous for humans.

### **Mammal and Reptile Movement Adaptations**
Moving from insects to larger animals, mammals and reptiles offer different movement strategies that have proven valuable for robotics. **Boston Dynamics' Spot robot dog** uses a four-legged design inspired by how dogs and other quadrupeds walk and run. By carefully studying how these animals shift their weight and coordinate their legs, engineers created a robot that can climb stairs, navigate rough terrain, and even recover its balance when pushed.

**Snake robots** represent another fascinating area of biomimicry. Real snakes can move without any legs, using a series of specialized movements like **side-winding** or **concertina motion**. Engineers have created snake-inspired robots with many connected segments that can squeeze through tight spaces, climb poles, and even swim. These snake robots are especially useful for inspecting pipes, exploring narrow caves, or searching through rubble after earthquakes.

The way lizards use their tails for balance has even inspired robots that can adjust their "tails" to maintain stability when jumping or running at high speeds.

### **Bird and Fish Locomotion in Robotics**
While land animals provide great inspiration, the sky and sea have provided engineers with incredible movement techniques as well. Flying and swimming require specialized movement approaches that robots can benefit from copying.

**Aerial robots** (drones) have borrowed many features from birds. Some drones now have wings that can change shape mid-flight, just like birds do when they transition from cruising to landing. Others use bird-inspired takeoff and landing techniques. The **Festo company** created a robotic seagull called **SmartBird** that can take off, fly, and land by flapping its wings just like a real bird, without using propellers.

Underwater, **fish-inspired robots** show how biomimicry can create smooth, efficient swimmers. **MIT's robotic fish** copies the way real fish move their bodies in a wave-like motion to push through water. This approach uses less energy than traditional propellers and creates less disturbance in the water, making these robots ideal for studying marine life without scaring it away. Other underwater robots mimic the unique movement of manta rays or the jet propulsion of squids and octopuses.

These bio-inspired designs allow robots to move through air and water with greater efficiency and maneuverability than conventional designs.
