# Robotics Glossary for Middle School Students

## Actuator
**Definition:**  A device that creates movement in a robot, like a motor or piston.
**Example:**  The actuator in your robot arm helps it pick up objects, similar to how muscles help your arm move.

## Autonomous
**Definition:**  Able to operate and make decisions without human control.
**Example:**  A robot vacuum is autonomous because it cleans your house by itself without you controlling it.

## Biomimicry
**Definition:**  Copying designs from nature to solve engineering problems.
**Example:**  Engineers created climbing robots with sticky feet by studying how geckos climb walls.

## Bipedal
**Definition:**  Walking on two legs, like humans do.
**Example:**  The humanoid robot uses bipedal movement to climb stairs just like you would.

## Brushless Motor
**Definition:**  An efficient electric motor that doesn't use carbon brushes to transfer electricity.
**Example:**  Many drones use brushless motors because they're lighter and last longer than regular motors.

## Commutator
**Definition:**  A split ring in a motor that reverses electricity flow to keep the motor spinning.
**Example:**  The commutator in your toy car's motor is like a traffic director, telling electricity which way to go.

## DC Motor
**Definition:**  A motor that uses direct current electricity to create continuous spinning motion.
**Example:**  The wheels on your robot car are powered by DC motors that keep spinning until you turn them off.

## Differential Drive
**Definition:**  A steering system using two separately powered wheels on opposite sides.
**Example:**  Your robot can turn by making its left and right wheels spin at different speeds, like a tank.

## Drone
**Definition:**  A flying robot that moves through the air, usually with propellers.
**Example:**  Camera drones fly above sporting events to take videos from high in the air.

## Electromagnetism
**Definition:**  The relationship between electricity and magnetism that makes motors work.
**Example:**  Your robot's motors use electromagnetism to turn electrical energy into spinning motion.

## Gear Ratio
**Definition:**  The relationship between connected gears that changes speed and force.
**Example:**  A small gear driving a larger gear creates more force but slower movement, like bicycle gears.

## Hexapod
**Definition:**  A six-legged robot inspired by insects.
**Example:**  The hexapod robot can walk over rough ground without falling because it always keeps three legs on the ground.

## Input-Processing-Output
**Definition:**  The three-step cycle robots use: gather information, think about it, then act.
**Example:**  Your robot detects a wall (input), decides to turn (processing), then activates its motors (output).

## Lidar
**Definition:**  A sensor that uses laser light to measure distances and create maps.
**Example:**  Self-driving cars use lidar to create 3D maps of the road and detect other vehicles.

## Mecanum Wheel
**Definition:**  A special wheel with angled rollers that allows robots to move sideways.
**Example:**  Robots with Mecanum wheels can slide sideways to fit through narrow doorways without turning.

## Omnidirectional
**Definition:**  Able to move in any direction without needing to turn first.
**Example:**  An omnidirectional robot can slide sideways or diagonally like a hockey puck, not just forward and backward.

## Quadcopter
**Definition:**  A flying robot with four propellers that can hover and move in any direction.
**Example:**  Many camera drones are quadcopters because they can stay steady in the air to take clear pictures.

## Quadrupedal
**Definition:**  Moving on four legs, like a dog or cat.
**Example:**  Boston Dynamics' Spot is a quadrupedal robot that can climb stairs and walk on rough ground.

## Regenerative Braking
**Definition:**  A system that captures energy when a robot slows down to recharge its battery.
**Example:**  Electric cars use regenerative braking to extend their driving range when going downhill.

## Rotor
**Definition:**  The spinning part inside a motor that creates movement.
**Example:**  When electricity flows through your robot's motor, the rotor spins to power the wheels.

## Servo Motor
**Definition:**  A precise motor that can move to exact positions and hold them.
**Example:**  Robot arms use servo motors to position their grippers at exactly the right angle to pick up objects.

## Stator
**Definition:**  The stationary outer part of a motor that contains magnets.
**Example:**  The stator in your robot's motor stays still while the inner part spins to create movement.

## Stepper Motor
**Definition:**  A motor that moves in precise, fixed steps rather than spinning continuously.
**Example:**  3D printers use stepper motors to position the print head with exact precision.

## Surface Tension
**Definition:**  The property that makes water's surface act like a stretchy skin.
**Example:**  Some tiny robots can walk on water using surface tension, just like water strider insects.

## Tensegrity
**Definition:**  A structure using both rigid parts and flexible cables to maintain its shape.
**Example:**  NASA's Super Ball Bot uses tensegrity to absorb impacts when landing on other planets.

## Torque
**Definition:**  Rotational force that causes turning or twisting motion.
**Example:**  A robot arm needs high torque to lift heavy objects, just like you need strong muscles.

## Tracked Movement
**Definition:**  Using continuous treads (like tank tracks) instead of wheels to move.
**Example:**  Search and rescue robots often use tracks to climb over rubble and debris after disasters.

## Ultrasonic Sensor
**Definition:**  A device that uses sound waves to detect objects and measure distances.
**Example:**  Your robot uses ultrasonic sensors like bat echolocation to avoid bumping into walls.

## Wave Glider
**Definition:**  A water robot that uses ocean wave energy to move forward without motors.
**Example:**  Wave gliders can travel across oceans for months collecting data about water temperature and marine life.

## Zero Moment Point
**Definition:**  A method that helps walking robots stay balanced by carefully controlling each step.
**Example:**  Humanoid robots use zero moment point calculations to walk without falling, like a tightrope walker.
