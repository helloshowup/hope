## **Building Your First Programs**

In visual programming environments like Scratch or Blockly, sequences are built by connecting blocks that represent different actions.

### **Visual Programming Blocks**

Visual programming uses colored blocks that snap together to form sequences. The blocks typically include:
- Motion blocks (move, turn)
- Control blocks (wait, repeat)
- Sensor blocks (detect obstacles)
- Output blocks (display, make sound)

Each block represents a single instruction, and the sequence reads from top to bottom.

### **Creating a Basic Sequence Program**

Let's create a simple program for a robot to navigate around an obstacle:
1. Move forward 2 steps
2. Turn right 90 degrees
3. Move forward 3 steps
4. Turn left 90 degrees
5. Move forward 2 steps

This sequence creates a path that moves around an imaginary obstacle in your way.

### **From Simple to Complex Algorithms**

The same principles you use to create simple algorithms can be applied to more complex robotics challenges:

- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently
- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement
- A robot arm in a factory uses algorithms to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes

As robots become more advanced, their algorithms include more steps and decision points, but they still follow the same basic principles of clear, ordered instructions.

## **Activity 2: Building a Simple Sequence**

Using a visual programming environment (or drawing on paper), create a sequence of commands that would guide a robot to draw a square. Your program should include movement commands (forward, backward) and turning commands (right, left). Think carefully about the order of commands and how many times each action needs to be performed. Test your sequence by tracing through it step by step to verify it works correctly.
