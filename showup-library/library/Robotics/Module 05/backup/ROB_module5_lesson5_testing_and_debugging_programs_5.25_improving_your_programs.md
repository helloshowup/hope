## **Improving Your Programs**

Debugging isn't just about fixing errorsâ€”it's also an opportunity to improve your code.

### **Refactoring for Clarity**

After fixing bugs, look for ways to make your code clearer and more maintainable:
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Break long functions into smaller, focused ones
- Add comments explaining complex sections

For example, instead of using a variable name like "s1" for a sensor, use "distanceSensor" to make your code easier to understand.

### **Performance Optimization**

Once your program works correctly, you might want to make it run more efficiently:
- Remove unnecessary steps
- Look for repeated code that could be turned into a function
- Consider whether there are more efficient algorithms

In robotics, efficient code can save battery power and make your robot respond more quickly to its environment.

### **Documentation**

Good documentation helps you and others understand your code later:
- Explain what your program does
- Document any assumptions or limitations
- Note any special cases or considerations

For example, document that your line-following robot works best on high-contrast surfaces or that your obstacle-avoidance program expects objects to be at least 5cm tall to be detected reliably.
