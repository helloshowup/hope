# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Robot Commands
- Move forward
- Turn left
- Turn right

## Programming Blocks
- Command blocks are used to give instructions to robots
- Blocks must be arranged in the correct order
- The Sequencer Game involves arranging jumbled command blocks

## Types of Programming Blocks
- Movement blocks (move forward, turn left, turn right)
- Loop blocks (repeat actions multiple times)
- Conditional blocks (if obstacle detected)

## Purpose of the Sequencer Game
- Practice programming skills
- Learn to arrange commands in logical order
- Help robots reach destinations without hitting obstacles

## Programming Skills Developed
- Breaking down problems into smaller steps
- Thinking about logical order of commands
- Using loops for efficient repetition
- Using conditions for robot decision-making

## Game Strategy
- Look at the whole maze/challenge before starting
- Think about the path needed
- Arrange commands to follow the planned path
