# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Algorithm Concepts
- An **algorithm** is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task or solve a problem
- Algorithms are like recipes that tell you exactly what to do and in what order
- Algorithms are the foundation of how computers process information
- Computers need precise, ordered steps to follow

## Real-World Algorithm Examples
- Everyday algorithms include:
  - Tying shoes
  - Brushing teeth
  - Making a sandwich
- Technology algorithms include:
  - Racing games calculating when cars should slow down
  - School security systems deciding when to lock doors
  - Music apps suggesting songs based on listening history
  - Traffic lights controlling signal timing

## Algorithm Components
- Each step in an algorithm should:
  - Be specific and unambiguous
  - Contain only one action
  - Use precise language
  - Follow a logical order

## Order in Algorithms
- The order of steps in a sequence matters tremendously
- Executing steps in the wrong order can produce incorrect results
- Example: pouring milk before opening the carton won't work

## Visual Programming Basics
- Visual programming uses colored blocks that snap together
- Common block types include:
  - Motion blocks (move, turn)
  - Control blocks (wait, repeat)
  - Sensor blocks (detect obstacles)
  - Output blocks (display, make sound)
- Blocks are connected from top to bottom

## Common Sequence Errors
- Missing steps: Skipping a necessary action
- Incorrect order: Putting steps in an illogical order
- Ambiguous instructions: Using unclear directions
- Infinite loops: Creating sequences that never end

## Debugging
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code
- Professional programmers spend about 50% of their time debugging code
