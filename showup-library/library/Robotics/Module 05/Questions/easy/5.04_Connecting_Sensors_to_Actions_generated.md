# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Sensor Concepts
- Sensors act as the "eyes," "ears," and "sense of touch" for robots
- Sensors convert physical phenomena like light, sound, or pressure into electrical signals
- In programming terms, sensors provide the **inputs** that drive decision-making
- Without sensors, a robot would be like a person trying to navigate with eyes closed and ears plugged

## Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Framework
- **Input**: Sensors collect data from the environment
- **Processing**: The robot's program interprets the data and makes decisions
- **Output**: Actuators (motors, lights, speakers) perform actions based on decisions
- Example: automatic doors at a grocery store use motion sensors (input), control system (processing), and motors (output)

## Conditional Statements
- Conditional statements are typically "if-then-else" structures
- They allow robots to make decisions based on sensor readings
- Basic structure: if (sensor_value meets condition) {do_something();} else {do_something_else();}
- Example: "If there's an obstacle less than 10 centimeters away, turn right; otherwise, keep moving forward"

## Threshold Values
- Thresholds are specific values that trigger different actions
- Example: A light sensor might return values from 0 (darkness) to 1023 (bright light)
- A threshold of 500 might separate "dark line" from "light background"
- Thresholds are similar to temperature settings on a thermostat

## Testing Approaches
- Start with controlled inputs to verify basic functionality
- Test edge cases at the boundaries of threshold values
- Create realistic test scenarios similar to intended environment
- Use incremental development starting with simple behaviors

## Common Sensor Challenges
- Environmental conditions like lighting can affect sensor performance
- Sensors may need regular recalibration to maintain accuracy
- Power fluctuations can affect sensor readings
- Calibration helps robots adjust to specific conditions
