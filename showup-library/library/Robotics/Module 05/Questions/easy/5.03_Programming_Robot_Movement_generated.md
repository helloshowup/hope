## Basic Robot Movement Commands
- **forward(distance)**: Moves the robot forward by the specified distance
- **backward(distance)**: Moves the robot backward by the specified distance  
- **left(degrees)**: Rotates the robot left by the specified number of degrees
- **right(degrees)**: Rotates the robot right by the specified number of degrees
- **wait(seconds)**: Pauses the robot's execution for the specified number of seconds

## Simple Movement Patterns
- **Line pattern** consists of:
  - Moving forward
  - Waiting
  - Moving backward

- **Square pattern** consists of:
  - Moving forward
  - Turning left 90 degrees
  - Repeating four times

- **Triangle pattern** consists of:
  - Moving forward
  - Turning left 120 degrees
  - Repeating three times

## Common Movement Errors
- Incorrect distances or angles
- Sequence errors (commands in wrong order)
- Missing commands
- Timing issues

## Debugging Process Steps
- Observe the robot's actual behavior
- Identify where deviation occurs
- Hypothesize about the cause
- Test by making a single change
- Repeat until fixed

## Real-World Applications
- Robot vacuums move differently on carpet versus tile floors
- School security robots patrol hallways
- Hospital delivery robots navigate corridors to deliver medications
