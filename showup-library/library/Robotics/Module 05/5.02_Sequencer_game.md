# Sequencer Game

In this activity, you'll play a Sequencer Game where you must arrange programming blocks in the correct order to complete a task. You'll use what you've learned about robot movement, loops, and conditions to solve navigation challenges.

For example, you'll be given a jumbled set of command blocks like:
- move forward
- turn left
- turn right
- repeat 3 times
- if obstacle detected

Your job is to put these blocks in the right order so your robot can reach its destination without hitting walls or obstacles. This is similar to how real programmers plan step-by-step instructions for robots to follow.

The Sequencer Game helps you practice important programming skills:
- Breaking down a big problem into smaller steps
- Thinking about the logical order of commands
- Using loops to repeat actions efficiently
- Using conditions to help the robot make decisions

As you play, remember to first look at the whole maze or challenge before starting. Think about the path your robot needs to take, then arrange your commands to follow that path.

Good luck with your programming challenge!
