#What Makes a Machine a Robot?
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Define what a robot is using the input-processing-output model
- Identify the three main capabilities every robot needs (sensing, thinking, acting)
- Distinguish between robots and non-robots using specific criteria

## Input-Processing-Output
Robots surround us today, from simple floor vacuums to complex machines exploring distant planets. But what exactlay makes something a robot? The **input-processing-output model** gives us a clear way to understand this. 

Think of it this way: a robot collects information from its surroundings (**input**), makes decisions based on that information (**processing**), and then responds accordingly (**output**). This three-step process separates robots from other machines. A toaster, for instance, heats bread but doesn't sense or make decisions about its environment.

Throughout this course, we'll use this model to examine different robots and understand how they work. It's like having a special pair of "robot glasses" that helps us see what makes these machines special!

## Introduction to Robots
### What Do You Think a Robot Is?

Before jumping into formal definitions, take a moment to consider what comes to mind when you hear the word "robot." You might picture a human-like machine from a movie, a factory robotic arm, a small toy robot, or perhaps a self-driving car.

Our ideas about robots typically come from movies, books, and toys. Some of you might think of R2-D2 from Star Wars, while others might imagine robots that look just like humans. These varied images reflect how our understanding of robots differs widely based on our personal experiences.

Let's use these initial thoughts as a jumping-off point as we work toward the more precise definition that engineers and scientists use.

### Early Definitions of Robots

The word "robot" first appeared in a 1920 play called "R.U.R." by Karel Čapek. In this play, robots were artificial people created to work in factories. The term comes from the Czech word "robota," meaning forced work or drudgery.

As technology progressed in the 1940s and 1950s, the first real robots began to emerge. These early robots were simple machines that could follow basic instructions to perform specific tasks. The first industrial robot, called **Unimate**, was installed in a General Motors factory in 1961 to help build cars.

During this period, scientists and engineers began defining robots as machines that could be programmed to perform tasks automatically. This definition mainly focused on the "output" part of our model—what the robot could do.

### Modern Robot Definition

Today, engineers define a robot more specifically as a machine that can sense its environment, process that information, and then act based on what it sensed and processed. This definition encompasses all three parts of our model: input, processing, and output.

Modern robots range from basic to sophisticated. A simple robot might use a single sensor to detect an obstacle and then move around it. A more complex robot, like a self-driving car, uses numerous sensors to create a detailed map of its surroundings, processes this information to make driving decisions, and then controls its speed and direction accordingly.

What distinguishes today's definition from earlier ones is the emphasis on all three capabilities—**sensing**, **thinking**, and **acting**—working together as a system. A machine missing any of these three elements isn't considered a true robot by current standards.

	
## Key Takeaways
- Robots collect information (input), make decisions (processing), and respond to their environment (output).
- Every true robot needs all three abilities: sensing, thinking, and acting.
Regular machines like toasters aren't robots because they can't sense and make decisions about their environment.
