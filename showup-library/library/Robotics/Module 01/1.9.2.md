By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Analyze devices using the input-processing-output model to determine if they qualify as robots
- Identify the common features that characterize everyday robots
- Evaluate the level of advancement of a robot based on specific technical criteria
## **Analyzing Everyday Robots**

### **Identifying Inputs, Processing, and Outputs**

To determine if a device is truly a robot, we need to identify how it senses, thinks, and acts. Let's break down this framework:

 

**Inputs (Sensing)**: Look for sensors that collect information from the environment. Common sensors include: Cameras for visual information 

* Microphones for sound detection  
* Touch sensors for physical contact  
* Temperature sensors for heat detection  
* Proximity sensors to detect nearby objects  
* Light sensors to detect brightness levels  
* GPS for location information  
*  

**Processing (Thinking)**: This is the "brain" of the robot, where decisions are made. Look for:

* Computer chips or circuit boards  
* Programming that allows the device to make decisions  
* Memory that stores information  
* Ability to change behavior based on different inputs  
* Learning capabilities that improve performance over time

**Outputs (Acting)**: These are the ways the robot affects its environment: 

* Movement (wheels, arms, propellers)  
* Sound production (speakers, alarms)  
* Visual displays (screens, lights)  
* Communication (sending messages, connecting to other devices)  
* Physical changes to the environment (cleaning, moving objects)

 

When analyzing a device, ask: Does it gather information? Does it process that information to make decisions? Does it take actions based on those decisions? If yes to all three, you're looking at a robot\!

### **Common Features of Everyday Robots**

Most everyday robots share several key characteristics that make them useful in our daily lives:

 

**Automation** is perhaps the most important featureâ€”robots perform tasks with minimal human intervention. Once programmed or activated, they work independently to complete their assigned functions.

 

**User interfaces** allow humans to communicate with robots through buttons, touchscreens, voice commands, or smartphone apps. These interfaces are becoming more intuitive, making robots accessible to people of all ages and technical abilities.

 

**Power management** systems help robots operate efficiently. Most have rechargeable batteries and can either dock themselves for charging or alert users when power is low.

 

**Connectivity** features allow many modern robots to connect to the internet or other devices. This enables software updates, remote control, and integration with other smart home systems.

 

**Safety mechanisms** prevent robots from causing harm. These include obstacle detection, automatic shutdowns when problems occur, and physical designs that minimize potential injuries.

### **What Makes Some Everyday Robots More Advanced**

Not all robots are created equal\! Several factors determine how advanced a robot is:

 

**Autonomy** refers to how independently a robot can operate. Basic robots follow simple, pre-programmed instructions, while advanced robots can make complex decisions without human input. A robot vacuum that creates its own cleaning path is more autonomous than one that follows a predetermined route.

 

**Adaptability** is a robot's ability to function in changing environments or situations. Advanced robots can adjust their behavior based on new circumstances, like a delivery robot finding an alternative route when its path is blocked.

 

**Learning capability** allows robots to improve their performance over time. Simple robots perform the same way every time, but advanced robots use artificial intelligence to learn from experience. For example, a smart thermostat learns your temperature preferences over time.

 

**Sensory complexity** refers to the number and sophistication of sensors. Advanced robots often combine multiple sensor types to build a more complete picture of their environment, similar to how humans use multiple senses.

 

**Interaction capabilities** determine how naturally a robot can communicate with humans. Advanced robots understand natural language, recognize emotions, or respond to gestures, creating more intuitive interactions.

 

**CHECKPOINT**: Would you prefer to have more or fewer robots in your everyday life? Why?


## Key Takeaways

- Robots are defined by their ability to sense (inputs), think (processing), and act (outputs) on their environment, with everyday robots featuring automation, user interfaces, power management, connectivity, and safety mechanisms.
- The advancement level of a robot can be evaluated based on five key factors: autonomy, adaptability, learning capability, sensory complexity, and interaction capabilities.
