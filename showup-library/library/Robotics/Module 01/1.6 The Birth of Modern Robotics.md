# 1.6 The Birth of Modern Robotics

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Explain how the invention of computers and microprocessors transformed robotics in the 20th century
- Identify the key features and historical significance of the first programmable robots
- Compare modern computer-controlled robots to mechanical automatons using the input-processing-output model

The 20th century marked a dramatic turning point in robotics history. While mechanical automatons had existed for centuries, the invention of electricity, electronic circuits, and eventually computers changed everything about what robots could do. 

The first true modern robots emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954, George Devol invented the first programmable robotic arm called **"Unimate,"** which was installed in a General Motors factory in 1961. Unlike the mechanical automatons of the past, **Unimate** could be reprogrammed to perform different tasks without being completely rebuilt. This flexibility was revolutionary!

The development of microprocessors in the 1970s made robots smaller, more affordable, and much more capable. Suddenly, robots could process information faster, store more instructions, and respond to their environment in ways that were impossible with purely mechanical systems. This era marked the transition from robots as interesting mechanical curiosities to practical tools that could transform industries.

Looking at this transition through our **input-processing-output model**, we can see how each component improved dramatically:
- **Input**: Electronic sensors could detect light, sound, touch, and distance
- **Processing**: Computers could make decisions based on sensor information
- **Output**: Electric motors provided more precise and varied movements

These improvements allowed robots to respond to their environments in ways that mechanical automatons never could.

## First Programmable Robots

As already explored, the first truly programmable robot was the **Unimate**, created by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger in the late 1950s. This robotic arm was installed in a General Motors factory in 1961, where it performed dangerous die-casting work that could harm human workers. Unlike earlier mechanical devices, **Unimate** could be reprogrammed to perform different tasks by changing its instructions—no physical rebuilding required!

In 1966, researchers at Stanford University created **"Shakey,"** the first mobile robot that could reason about its surroundings. **Shakey** used a camera and sensors to perceive objects around it, and could plan how to navigate through rooms and move objects. Though slow and clumsy by today's standards, **Shakey** represented a huge leap forward because it could make decisions based on what it "saw."

These early programmable robots were massive machines that required large computers to operate, but they demonstrated something revolutionary: robots could now adapt to different situations without human intervention. This flexibility made robots much more useful and set the stage for the explosion of robotics applications we see today.

## The Computer Revolution

The invention of the **microprocessor** in the early 1970s changed robotics forever. Before microprocessors, robots needed to be connected to room-sized computers to function. The microprocessor—essentially a tiny computer on a single chip—allowed robots to have "brains" built right into their bodies. This made robots smaller, cheaper, and much more practical for everyday use.

As computers became more powerful throughout the 1980s and 1990s, robots gained amazing new abilities. They could process information from multiple sensors at once, recognize objects and patterns, and make increasingly complex decisions. The development of better software and programming languages also made robots easier to program and control.

By the early 2000s, advances in **artificial intelligence** began to give robots the ability to learn from experience and adapt to new situations. Instead of following fixed programs, modern robots can use **machine learning** algorithms to improve their performance over time. For example, a robot vacuum can map your house and figure out the most efficient cleaning path, something that would have seemed like science fiction to the creators of the first programmable robots!

These advances in computing created significant challenges for robot designers. Early robots often had limited battery life, slow processing speeds, and bulky components. Engineers had to find creative ways to make robots that could operate efficiently despite these limitations. Today's robot designers face different challenges, like creating robots that can safely work alongside humans or operate in unpredictable environments.
