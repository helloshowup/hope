    <h1>1.9 Robots All Around Us</h1>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify at least 5 examples of robots in home, school, or community settings
- Classify everyday technologies as robots or non-robots using the input-processing-output framework
- Compare fictional robots with real-world robots</p>
<h2>Lesson Podcast Discussion: Robots in Our Daily Lives</h2>
<p>Robots aren't just characters in science fiction movies anymore—they're all around us! In this podcast, we explore how robots have become a regular part of our everyday lives. From the moment we wake up to when we go to sleep, robots help us in many ways we might not even notice.</p>
<p>The <strong>input-processing-output framework</strong> gives us a simple way to identify robots. Remember, a robot needs to:
1. Take in information from its surroundings (<strong>input/sensing</strong>)
2. Make decisions based on that information (<strong>processing/thinking</strong>)
3. Take action in the physical world (<strong>output/acting</strong>)</p>
<p>Using this framework, we can spot robots that might not look like the humanoid machines we see in movies. Many don't have arms, legs, or faces, but they still sense, think, and act in their environments!</p>
<h2>Robots in the Home</h2>
<h3>Smart Home Assistants and Speakers</h3>
<p>Smart speakers like Amazon Echo (Alexa), Google Home, and Apple HomePod have become common household helpers. These devices are definitely robots, even though they don't move around. Let's see how they fit our robot definition:</p>
<p>For inputs, they use microphones to hear your voice commands and questions. Some models also have temperature sensors, light sensors, or touch controls. </p>
<p>For processing, they use powerful computer chips and artificial intelligence to understand human language, recognize different voices, and decide how to respond to requests.</p>
<p>For outputs, they speak back to you through speakers, display information on screens (if they have them), control other devices in your home, or even order products online.</p>
<p>These smart assistants can play music, answer questions, set timers, control lights, and much more—all without having wheels or arms!</p>
<h3>Cleaning and Maintenance Robots</h3>
<p>Cleaning robots have revolutionized how we maintain our homes. Robotic vacuum cleaners like Roomba navigate around furniture, detect dirt, and automatically return to their charging stations when finished. </p>
<p>Let's analyze a robotic vacuum using our input-processing-output framework:
- <strong>Inputs</strong>: Bump sensors detect walls and furniture, cliff sensors prevent falls down stairs, dirt sensors detect messy areas, and cameras or lasers map the room
- <strong>Processing</strong>: The robot's computer brain uses these inputs to create a map of your home, plan an efficient cleaning path, and decide when to use extra suction for dirty spots
- <strong>Outputs</strong>: The robot moves around your home, turns on suction to clean, adjusts brushes for different floor types, and returns to its charging station when done</p>
<p>One challenge engineers face when designing these robots is battery life. The robot needs enough power to clean an entire home but can't be too heavy or it won't move efficiently. This is why most robotic vacuums automatically return to charge before the battery dies completely!</p>
<p>But vacuums aren't the only cleaning robots! Robotic mops can wet-clean hard floors, window-cleaning robots use suction to stick to glass while wiping it clean, and robotic lawn mowers can keep your grass trimmed without you pushing them around.</p>
<p>These maintenance robots save us time and energy by handling repetitive tasks. They're especially helpful for people with mobility issues or busy schedules. Most can be programmed to work on specific schedules, so your floors can be cleaned while you're at work or asleep!</p>
<h3>Kitchen and Food Preparation Robots</h3>
<p>The kitchen is becoming a high-tech space with robots that help prepare and cook food. Smart refrigerators can track food inventory, suggest recipes based on what's inside, and even alert you when food is about to expire. Some have cameras so you can check what's inside while grocery shopping!</p>
<p>Automated cooking devices like the Thermomix can chop, blend, cook, and stir food according to programmed recipes. Coffee robots can grind beans, heat water to the perfect temperature, and brew your morning cup exactly how you like it.</p>
<p>Even simpler devices like programmable rice cookers or bread makers use sensors to monitor cooking progress, processors to adjust cooking time and temperature, and mechanisms to complete the cooking process—making them robots too!</p>
<p>As technology advances, we're seeing more sophisticated kitchen robots that can flip burgers, make pizzas, or even prepare entire meals with minimal human intervention.</p>
<h2>Robots in Schools and Communities</h2>
<h3>Educational Robots</h3>
<p>Schools are embracing robots as powerful teaching tools. Small programmable robots like Dash and Dot, Sphero, or LEGO Mindstorms help students learn coding concepts by allowing them to program movements and actions. These robots respond to commands, navigate obstacles, and can even interact with their environment.</p>
<p>Some educational robots like NAO or Pepper can recognize faces, understand speech, and engage students in conversations. They're being used to teach everything from language skills to science concepts.</p>
<p>In some classrooms, telepresence robots allow students who can't physically attend school to participate remotely. These robots have screens showing the remote student's face and can be controlled to move around the classroom, raising their hand or turning to see different parts of the room.</p>
<p>These educational robots make learning more interactive and engaging while teaching important skills for future careers in technology and engineering.</p>
<h3>Service Robots in Public Spaces</h3>
<p>Next time you're in a mall, airport, or hospital, look around—you might spot service robots helping people! Information kiosks with touchscreens and voice recognition can answer questions, provide directions, or help you find what you need.</p>
<p>Security robots patrol some buildings and parking lots, using cameras and sensors to detect unusual activity. They can alert human security guards if they spot something suspicious.</p>
<p>In hospitals, robots deliver medications, transport lab samples, and even disinfect rooms using ultraviolet light. These robots help reduce the spread of germs and free up healthcare workers to focus on patient care.</p>
<p>Some hotels now use robot concierges to answer guest questions, deliver room service items, or guide guests to facilities. These robots typically have friendly designs to make interactions more pleasant.</p>
<h3>Delivery and Transportation Robots</h3>
<p>Robots are changing how things move around our communities. Small delivery robots that look like coolers on wheels navigate sidewalks to deliver food, groceries, and packages. They use cameras, GPS, and other sensors to find their way and avoid obstacles.</p>
<p>Drones are becoming more common for package delivery, especially in areas that are hard to reach by road. These flying robots can carry packages to your doorstep and return to their base without a human pilot.</p>
<p>In some cities, self-driving shuttles transport people along fixed routes. While not fully autonomous yet, these vehicles use sensors to detect traffic, pedestrians, and road conditions, gradually moving us toward a future with more robotic transportation.</p>
<p>Even some parking garages use robotic systems to park cars more efficiently, lifting and storing vehicles in tight spaces that would be difficult for human drivers to navigate.</p>
<h2>Activity 1: Robot Detective Challenge</h2>
<p>Become a robot detective in your own environment! Create a simple log or journal documenting at least 5 robots you encounter over the next day. For each robot, note its name, location, and specifically how it demonstrates the three robot qualities (sensing, thinking, acting). Consider devices you might not initially recognize as robots. Be prepared to share your most surprising discovery.</p>
<h2>Entertainment Robots</h2>
<h3>Toy Robots</h3>
<p>Robot toys have come a long way from simple wind-up toys! Today's toy robots can recognize voice commands, navigate around obstacles, and even express emotions through sounds and movements.</p>
<p>Let's compare a remote-controlled toy car with an autonomous toy robot to understand the difference:</p>
<p><strong>Remote-controlled toy car:</strong>
- <strong>Inputs</strong>: Receives signals from the remote control
- <strong>Processing</strong>: Simple circuits convert remote signals to motor actions
- <strong>Outputs</strong>: Motors turn wheels and steer the car
- <strong>Is it a robot?</strong> Not quite! While it has inputs and outputs, it doesn't make its own decisions - you make all the decisions with the remote control</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous toy robot:</strong>
- <strong>Inputs</strong>: Has sensors that detect obstacles, light, or sound
- <strong>Processing</strong>: Uses a microcontroller to make decisions based on sensor information
- <strong>Outputs</strong>: Moves, makes sounds, or lights up based on its own decisions
- <strong>Is it a robot?</strong> Yes! It senses its environment, processes that information, and takes action on its own</p>
<p>Programmable robot toys like Cozmo or Vector have personalities that develop as you interact with them. They can recognize faces, play games, and respond to your voice or touch. Some can even be programmed using simple coding interfaces on tablets or smartphones.</p>
<p>Educational robot kits allow children to build their own robots, learning about mechanics, electronics, and programming along the way. These kits often include sensors, motors, and programmable controllers that let kids create robots that respond to light, sound, or touch.</p>
<p>Robot pets like Sony's Aibo dog or various robotic cats provide companionship without the responsibilities of caring for a living animal. These robots can respond to petting, learn tricks, and simulate the behaviors of real pets.</p>
<h3>Robot Competitions and Shows</h3>
<p>Robot competitions have become exciting events that showcase technological creativity. FIRST Robotics competitions challenge students to build robots that can complete specific tasks, teaching teamwork and engineering skills along the way.</p>
<p>BattleBots and similar competitions feature combat robots designed to disable opponents in an arena. These events highlight durability, power, and strategic design in robot construction.</p>
<p>Robot exhibitions and shows feature performances by sophisticated robots that can dance, play music, or perform acrobatics. Japan's robot restaurants feature robot performers that entertain diners with choreographed shows.</p>
<p>These competitions and shows inspire future engineers and roboticists while demonstrating the current capabilities of robot technology in an entertaining format.</p>
<h3>Interactive Entertainment Robots</h3>
<p>Entertainment venues increasingly use robots to create immersive experiences. Theme parks feature animatronic characters that move, speak, and interact with visitors, creating magical experiences that blend technology with storytelling.</p>
<p>Some museums use interactive robot guides that can answer questions about exhibits and provide personalized tours based on visitor interests.</p>
<p>Social robots designed for entertainment can tell jokes, play games, or engage in simple conversations. These robots often have expressive faces or movements that make interactions more engaging and fun.</p>
<p>Virtual reality systems paired with robotic elements can create physical feedback for gaming experiences, allowing players to feel impacts or resistance that matches what they see in the virtual world.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Everyday Robots</h2>
<h3>Identifying Inputs, Processing, and Outputs</h3>
<p>To determine if a device is truly a robot, we need to identify how it senses, thinks, and acts. Let's break down this framework:</p>
<p><strong>Inputs (Sensing)</strong>: Look for sensors that collect information from the environment. Common sensors include:
- Cameras for visual information
- Microphones for sound detection
- Touch sensors for physical contact
- Temperature sensors for heat detection
- Proximity sensors to detect nearby objects
- Light sensors to detect brightness levels
- GPS for location information</p>
<p><strong>Processing (Thinking)</strong>: This is the "brain" of the robot, where decisions are made. Look for:
- Computer chips or circuit boards
- Programming that allows the device to make decisions
- Memory that stores information
- Ability to change behavior based on different inputs
- Learning capabilities that improve performance over time</p>
<p><strong>Outputs (Acting)</strong>: These are the ways the robot affects its environment:
- Movement (wheels, arms, propellers)
- Sound production (speakers, alarms)
- Visual displays (screens, lights)
- Communication (sending messages, connecting to other devices)
- Physical changes to the environment (cleaning, moving objects)</p>
<p>When analyzing a device, ask: Does it gather information? Does it process that information to make decisions? Does it take actions based on those decisions? If yes to all three, you're looking at a robot!</p>
<h3>Common Features of Everyday Robots</h3>
<p>Most everyday robots share several key characteristics that make them useful in our daily lives:</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> is perhaps the most important feature—robots perform tasks with minimal human intervention. Once programmed or activated, they work independently to complete their assigned functions.</p>
<p><strong>User interfaces</strong> allow humans to communicate with robots through buttons, touchscreens, voice commands, or smartphone apps. These interfaces are becoming more intuitive, making robots accessible to people of all ages and technical abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Power management</strong> systems help robots operate efficiently. Most have rechargeable batteries and can either dock themselves for charging or alert users when power is low.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong> features allow many modern robots to connect to the internet or other devices. This enables software updates, remote control, and integration with other smart home systems.</p>
<p><strong>Safety mechanisms</strong> prevent robots from causing harm. These include obstacle detection, automatic shutdowns when problems occur, and physical designs that minimize potential injuries.</p>
<h3>What Makes Some Everyday Robots More Advanced</h3>
<p>Not all robots are created equal! Several factors determine how advanced a robot is:</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy</strong> refers to how independently a robot can operate. Basic robots follow simple, pre-programmed instructions, while advanced robots can make complex decisions without human input. A robot vacuum that creates its own cleaning path is more autonomous than one that follows a predetermined route.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptability</strong> is a robot's ability to function in changing environments or situations. Advanced robots can adjust their behavior based on new circumstances, like a delivery robot finding an alternative route when its path is blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Learning capability</strong> allows robots to improve their performance over time. Simple robots perform the same way every time, but advanced robots use artificial intelligence to learn from experience. For example, a smart thermostat learns your temperature preferences over time.</p>
<p><strong>Sensory complexity</strong> refers to the number and sophistication of sensors. Advanced robots often combine multiple sensor types to build a more complete picture of their environment, similar to how humans use multiple senses.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction capabilities</strong> determine how naturally a robot can communicate with humans. Advanced robots understand natural language, recognize emotions, or respond to gestures, creating more intuitive interactions.</p>
