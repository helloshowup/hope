# Splitting the Lesson into Three Natural Parts

Based on my analysis of the content, here are three natural breaking points that would allow you to split this lesson into three separate pages without requiring a rewrite:

## Lesson 1: Understanding Robot Parts - Input Components
**Content to include:**
- Introduction and Learning Objectives
- Materials Needed
- Lesson Podcast Discussion
- Input Components: How Robots Sense
  - Types of Sensors and Their Functions
  - How Sensors Collect Data
  - Comparing Robot Sensors to Human Senses
  - Real-World Sensor Applications
- Activity 1: Robot-Human Comparison Chart

**Natural ending point:** After Activity 1, which focuses on comparing robot sensors to human senses, providing a complete exploration of input components.

## Lesson 2: Understanding Robot Parts - Processing Components
**Content to include:**
- Brief reminder of learning objectives (optional)
- Processing Components: How Robots Think
  - Robot Brains: Controllers and Computers
  - Memory and Programming
  - CHECKPOINT question
  - Decision-Making in Robots

**Natural ending point:** After the Decision-Making in Robots section, which completes the discussion of how robots process information.

## Lesson 3: Understanding Robot Parts - Output Components
**Content to include:**
- Brief reminder of learning objectives (optional)
- Output Components: How Robots Act
  - Motors and Movement
  - Grippers and Manipulators
  - Other Action Components
- Activity 2: Design Your Robot
- Key Takeaways box

**Natural ending point:** The end of the original lesson, with Activity 2 serving as a culminating exercise that brings together all three component types.

Each of these sections forms a cohesive unit focused on one of the three main types of robot components (input, processing, and output), making them logical standalone lessons while maintaining the flow of the original content.
