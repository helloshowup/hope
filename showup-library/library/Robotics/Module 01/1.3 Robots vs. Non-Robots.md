1.3
Robots vs. Non-Robots
Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

Apply the input-processing-output model to determine if a machine is a robot
Identify common misconceptions about what makes a robot
Use a simple decision-making framework to classify devices as robots or non-robots
Applying Our Definition
Now that we understand the input-processing-output model, let's use it to determine whether different machines qualify as robots. For a machine to be considered a robot, it must have all three capabilities: sensing, thinking, and acting.

 

Let's look at some examples:

Automatic door at a grocery store

 

Automatic door at grocery store
 
Sensing: Yes (motion sensors detect when someone approaches)

 

Thinking: Limited (simple if-then logic: if motion detected, then open)

 

Acting: Yes (motors open and close the door)

 

✅  Verdict: Basic robot (has all three capabilities, though thinking is simple)

 

Traditional washing machine

 

Automatic door at grocery store
 
Sensing: Yes (motion sensors detect when someone approaches)

 

Thinking: Limited (simple if-then logic: if motion detected, then open)

 

Acting: Yes (motors open and close the door)

 

❌ Verdict: Basic robot (has all three capabilities, though thinking is simple)

Suggest we do the below all in the above format

 

Automatic door at a grocery store

Sensing: Yes (motion sensors detect when someone approaches)
Thinking: Limited (simple if-then logic: if motion detected, then open)
Acting: Yes (motors open and close the door)
Verdict: Basic robot (has all three capabilities, though thinking is simple)
Traditional washing machine

Sensing: Limited (water level sensor, maybe temperature)
Thinking: Very limited (follows pre-programmed cycles)
Acting: Yes (fills with water, spins drum, drains water)
Verdict: Not quite a robot (minimal sensing and thinking capabilities)
Smart refrigerator with inventory tracking

Sensing: Yes (cameras see what's inside, door sensors)
Thinking: Yes (processes images to identify foods, tracks expiration dates)
Acting: Limited (can adjust temperature, but can't move items around)
Verdict: Partial robot (strong in sensing and thinking, limited in acting)
Self-driving car

Sensing: Yes (cameras, radar, lidar, GPS)
Thinking: Yes (complex AI to navigate roads and avoid obstacles)
Acting: Yes (controls steering, acceleration, braking)
Verdict: Definitely a robot (strong capabilities in all three areas)
Smart home voice assistant (like Alexa or Google Home)

Sensing: Yes (microphones hear your voice, sometimes temperature sensors)
Thinking: Yes (processes speech, understands commands, connects to other devices)
Acting: Limited (can speak responses, control other devices, but can't move itself)
Verdict: Partial robot (excellent sensing and thinking, limited physical actions)
Toy remote-controlled car

Sensing: No (doesn't gather information about its environment)
Thinking: No (follows direct commands from the remote control)
Acting: Yes (motors drive wheels to move in different directions)
Verdict: Not a robot (missing sensing and independent thinking)
School hallway security system

Sensing: Yes (cameras detect movement, card readers identify people)
Thinking: Yes (determines if access should be granted based on ID)
Acting: Yes (locks/unlocks doors, sounds alarms if needed)
Verdict: Basic robot (performs all three functions in a limited environment)
This analysis shows that the line between robots and non-robots isn't always clear-cut. Some machines excel in one or two areas but fall short in others. The more capable a machine is in all three areas, the more confidently we can call it a robot.

Common Misconceptions
There are several common misunderstandings about what makes something a robot:

 

Misconception #1: "All robots look like humans." 

 

Reality: While some robots (called humanoid robots) are designed to look like people, most robots don't resemble humans at all. Robots are designed based on their function, not to mimic human appearance. A robot vacuum cleaner works better as a disk shape than if it were shaped like a person!

 

Misconception #2: "If it's automated, it's a robot." 

 

Reality: Automation alone doesn't make something a robot. A dishwasher automatically cleans dishes, but it doesn't sense its environment in meaningful ways or make decisions based on what it senses. It simply follows a pre-set program.

 

Misconception #3: "Remote-controlled devices are robots." 

 

Reality: Devices that are directly controlled by humans, like RC cars or drones flown with a controller, aren't true robots because they lack independent thinking. A human is making all the decisions instead of the machine processing information and deciding for itself.

 

Misconception #4: "Robots must be physical machines." 

 

Reality: While most robots have physical bodies, some exist as software only. These "software robots" or "bots" can sense digital environments, process information, and take actions online. However, in this course, we'll focus primarily on physical robots.

 

Understanding these distinctions helps us apply our definition more accurately and recognize true robots when we see them.

Stop and Reflect
Stop and Reflect
Think about a machine you use daily. Why would or wouldn't you consider it a robot based on our definition? Consider specifically which of the three main capabilities (sensing, thinking, acting) it possesses or lacks.

Robot or Not? Decision-Making Framework
Question to Jenna and Mark: Are Mermaid diagrams allowed (ie will they show) or should I always include the text version? 

 

To help you consistently identify robots, here's a simple flowchart you can follow:

 

Does the machine SENSE its environment on its own?

NO → Not a robot
YES → Continue to question 2
Does the machine THINK and make decisions based on what it sensed?

NO → Not a robot
YES → Continue to question 3
Does the machine ACT on its environment based on those decisions?

NO → Not a robot
YES → It's a robot!

 

 

Remember that each capability can exist at different levels:

Basic sensing might be a single touch sensor
Advanced sensing might include cameras, microphones, and dozens of other sensors
Simple thinking might be "if-then" rules
Complex thinking might involve artificial intelligence that learns and adapts
Basic actions might be turning lights on/off
Advanced actions might include precise movements in multiple directions
The more advanced a machine is in all three areas, the more "robot-like" it becomes. Some technologies fall into a gray area where they have strong capabilities in one or two areas but are weak in others.

 

Key Takeaways
A true robot must have all three capabilities: sensing (input), thinking (processing), and acting (output).
Not all automated or electronic devices are robots - many lack one or more of the three key capabilities.
Robots don't need to look like humans or be physical machines - their design follows their function.
