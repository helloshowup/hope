    <h1>1.12 Robotics Glossary for Module 1</h1>

<h2>Actuator</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that converts energy into movement or action, allowing robots to move or interact with their environment.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The motors in a robot's wheels are actuators that help it move around your classroom.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A step-by-step set of instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The algorithm for a line-following robot might say: 'If you see the line, go forward. If you lose the line, turn until you find it again.'</p>

<h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Computer systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions similar to humans. AI helps robots get smarter over time.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A smart speaker uses AI to understand your voice commands, even when you say things in different ways.</p>

<h2>Autonomous</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Able to operate and make decisions without human control. Autonomous robots work independently.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An autonomous robot vacuum cleans your house by itself, deciding where to go without you controlling it.</p>

<h2>Bump Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A simple touch sensor that activates when a robot collides with something in its path.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When your robot toy hits a wall, its bump sensor tells it to back up and turn another way.</p>

<h2>Camera Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that captures images, allowing robots to "see" their surroundings and recognize objects.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Self-driving cars use camera sensors to see traffic lights, road signs, and other vehicles.</p>

<h2>Chassis</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The main body or frame of a robot that supports and protects all the other components.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The chassis of your LEGO robot holds the motors, sensors, and controller together like a skeleton.</p>

<h2>Cobot</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A collaborative robot designed to work safely alongside humans, often with special sensors to avoid accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> In a car factory, cobots help human workers lift heavy parts without bumping into people.</p>

<h2>DC Motor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An electric motor that provides continuous rotation, commonly used to power wheels in robots.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The DC motors in your remote-control car make the wheels spin forward or backward.</p>

<h2>Distance Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that measures how far away objects are without touching them, helping robots avoid collisions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Your robot uses a distance sensor like bat sonar to stop before bumping into walls.</p>

<h2>End Effector</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The device at the end of a robot arm that interacts with objects, like a gripper, tool, or specialized attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A robot in a chocolate factory might have a suction cup end effector to pick up delicate candies.</p>

<h2>Encoder</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A sensor that tracks the position and movement of motors, helping robots know how far they've moved.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Encoders in a robot's wheels count rotations so it knows exactly how far it has traveled across the room.</p>

<h2>Gripper</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A robot hand or claw that can grab, hold, and release objects. Grippers come in many different designs.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The claw in an arcade machine is a simple gripper that picks up prizes when you play the game.</p>

<h2>Gyroscope</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A sensor that measures rotation and orientation, helping robots maintain balance and know which way they're facing.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A drone uses a gyroscope to stay level in the air, even when it's windy.</p>

<h2>Humanoid Robot</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A robot designed to look and move like a human, with a head, torso, arms, and legs.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The robots in your science museum that can walk, wave, and dance are humanoid robots.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Information that a robot collects from its environment through sensors. This is how robots "sense" the world.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When you speak to a smart speaker, your voice is the input it uses to understand your request.</p>

<h2>Input-Processing-Output Model</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A framework that explains how robots work by gathering information, making decisions, and taking actions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A smart thermostat senses temperature, decides if it's too hot or cold, then turns heating or cooling on or off.</p>

<h2>Light Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that detects brightness levels or colors, allowing robots to "see" and respond to light changes.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A line-following robot uses light sensors to detect the dark line against a light background.</p>

<h2>Lidar</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A sensing system that uses laser light to measure distances and create detailed 3D maps of surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Self-driving cars use lidar to create a 3D map of the road, other vehicles, and pedestrians.</p>

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A type of AI that allows robots to improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every situation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A robot vacuum learns the layout of your home over time and gets better at cleaning efficiently.</p>

<h2>Microcontroller</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A small computer on a single chip that serves as the brain of simpler robots, processing sensor data and controlling actions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The microcontroller in your robot kit reads sensor information and decides which motors to turn on.</p>

<h2>Microphone</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A sensor that detects sound waves, allowing robots to "hear" voices, noises, and audio commands.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Smart speakers use microphones to hear when you say "Hey Google" or "Alexa" to wake them up.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Actions a robot takes to affect its environment, such as moving, making sounds, or displaying information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When your robot toy moves its arms, flashes lights, or plays sounds, those are all outputs.</p>

<h2>Processing</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> How robots think and make decisions using computers or microcontrollers to interpret sensor data.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> When your game console processes your controller movements to make characters move on screen.</p>

<h2>Proximity Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that detects when objects are nearby without touching them, helping robots avoid collisions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Automatic doors use proximity sensors to detect when you're approaching so they can open for you.</p>

<h2>Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that detects changes in the environment and converts them into electrical signals robots can understand.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The sensors in your phone know when you rotate it and change the screen from portrait to landscape.</p>

<h2>Servo Motor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A motor that can move to exact positions and hold there, perfect for robot arms and precise movements.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The servo motors in a robot arm can position its gripper exactly where it needs to grab an object.</p>

<h2>Social Robot</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A robot designed to interact with humans in a natural way, often recognizing faces, speech, or emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Robot classroom assistants that can answer questions and help students with their work are social robots.</p>

<h2>Stepper Motor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A motor that moves in precise, fixed steps rather than rotating continuously, allowing for very accurate positioning.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 3D printers use stepper motors to move the printing head to exact locations with pinpoint accuracy.</p>

<h2>Temperature Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A device that measures heat levels, allowing robots to detect hot or cold objects or monitor environmental conditions.</p>
