# 1.12 Robotics Glossary for Module 1

## Actuator
**Definition:** A device that converts energy into movement or action, allowing robots to move or interact with their environment.

**Example:** The motors in a robot's wheels are actuators that help it move around your classroom.

## Algorithm
**Definition:** A step-by-step set of instructions that tells a robot how to solve a problem or complete a task.

**Example:** The algorithm for a line-following robot might say: 'If you see the line, go forward. If you lose the line, turn until you find it again.'

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Definition:** Computer systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions similar to humans. AI helps robots get smarter over time.

**Example:** A smart speaker uses AI to understand your voice commands, even when you say things in different ways.

## Autonomous
**Definition:** Able to operate and make decisions without human control. Autonomous robots work independently.

**Example:** An autonomous robot vacuum cleans your house by itself, deciding where to go without you controlling it.

## Bump Sensor
**Definition:** A simple touch sensor that activates when a robot collides with something in its path.

**Example:** When your robot toy hits a wall, its bump sensor tells it to back up and turn another way.

## Camera Sensor
**Definition:** A device that captures images, allowing robots to "see" their surroundings and recognize objects.

**Example:** Self-driving cars use camera sensors to see traffic lights, road signs, and other vehicles.

## Chassis
**Definition:** The main body or frame of a robot that supports and protects all the other components.

**Example:** The chassis of your LEGO robot holds the motors, sensors, and controller together like a skeleton.

## Cobot
**Definition:** A collaborative robot designed to work safely alongside humans, often with special sensors to avoid accidents.

**Example:** In a car factory, cobots help human workers lift heavy parts without bumping into people.

## DC Motor
**Definition:** An electric motor that provides continuous rotation, commonly used to power wheels in robots.

**Example:** The DC motors in your remote-control car make the wheels spin forward or backward.

## Distance Sensor
**Definition:** A device that measures how far away objects are without touching them, helping robots avoid collisions.

**Example:** Your robot uses a distance sensor like bat sonar to stop before bumping into walls.

## End Effector
**Definition:** The device at the end of a robot arm that interacts with objects, like a gripper, tool, or specialized attachment.

**Example:** A robot in a chocolate factory might have a suction cup end effector to pick up delicate candies.

## Encoder
**Definition:** A sensor that tracks the position and movement of motors, helping robots know how far they've moved.

**Example:** Encoders in a robot's wheels count rotations so it knows exactly how far it has traveled across the room.

## Gripper
**Definition:** A robot hand or claw that can grab, hold, and release objects. Grippers come in many different designs.

**Example:** The claw in an arcade machine is a simple gripper that picks up prizes when you play the game.

## Gyroscope
**Definition:** A sensor that measures rotation and orientation, helping robots maintain balance and know which way they're facing.

**Example:** A drone uses a gyroscope to stay level in the air, even when it's windy.

## Humanoid Robot
**Definition:** A robot designed to look and move like a human, with a head, torso, arms, and legs.

**Example:** The robots in your science museum that can walk, wave, and dance are humanoid robots.

## Input
**Definition:** Information that a robot collects from its environment through sensors. This is how robots "sense" the world.

**Example:** When you speak to a smart speaker, your voice is the input it uses to understand your request.

## Input-Processing-Output Model
**Definition:** A framework that explains how robots work by gathering information, making decisions, and taking actions.

**Example:** A smart thermostat senses temperature, decides if it's too hot or cold, then turns heating or cooling on or off.

## Light Sensor
**Definition:** A device that detects brightness levels or colors, allowing robots to "see" and respond to light changes.

**Example:** A line-following robot uses light sensors to detect the dark line against a light background.

## Lidar
**Definition:** A sensing system that uses laser light to measure distances and create detailed 3D maps of surroundings.

**Example:** Self-driving cars use lidar to create a 3D map of the road, other vehicles, and pedestrians.

## Machine Learning
**Definition:** A type of AI that allows robots to improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every situation.

**Example:** A robot vacuum learns the layout of your home over time and gets better at cleaning efficiently.

## Microcontroller
**Definition:** A small computer on a single chip that serves as the brain of simpler robots, processing sensor data and controlling actions.

**Example:** The microcontroller in your robot kit reads sensor information and decides which motors to turn on.

## Microphone
**Definition:** A sensor that detects sound waves, allowing robots to "hear" voices, noises, and audio commands.

**Example:** Smart speakers use microphones to hear when you say "Hey Google" or "Alexa" to wake them up.

## Output
**Definition:** Actions a robot takes to affect its environment, such as moving, making sounds, or displaying information.

**Example:** When your robot toy moves its arms, flashes lights, or plays sounds, those are all outputs.

## Processing
**Definition:** How robots think and make decisions using computers or microcontrollers to interpret sensor data.

**Example:** When your game console processes your controller movements to make characters move on screen.

## Proximity Sensor
**Definition:** A device that detects when objects are nearby without touching them, helping robots avoid collisions.

**Example:** Automatic doors use proximity sensors to detect when you're approaching so they can open for you.

## Sensor
**Definition:** A device that detects changes in the environment and converts them into electrical signals robots can understand.

**Example:** The sensors in your phone know when you rotate it and change the screen from portrait to landscape.

## Servo Motor
**Definition:** A motor that can move to exact positions and hold there, perfect for robot arms and precise movements.

**Example:** The servo motors in a robot arm can position its gripper exactly where it needs to grab an object.

## Social Robot
**Definition:** A robot designed to interact with humans in a natural way, often recognizing faces, speech, or emotions.

**Example:** Robot classroom assistants that can answer questions and help students with their work are social robots.

## Stepper Motor
**Definition:** A motor that moves in precise, fixed steps rather than rotating continuously, allowing for very accurate positioning.

**Example:** 3D printers use stepper motors to move the printing head to exact locations with pinpoint accuracy.

## Temperature Sensor
**Definition:** A device that measures heat levels, allowing robots to detect hot or cold objects or monitor environmental conditions.

**Example:** A cooking robot uses temperature sensors to know when food is properly cooked without burning it.

## Touch Sensor
**Definition:** A sensor that detects physical contact, acting like a robot's sense of touch to know when it bumps into something.

**Example:** The buttons on your game controller are simple touch sensors that respond when you press them.

## Ultrasonic Sensor
**Definition:** A sensor that uses sound waves humans can't hear to measure distances, similar to how bats navigate.

**Example:** Parking assist systems use ultrasonic sensors to beep faster as your car gets closer to obstacles.

## Unimate
**Definition:** The first industrial robot, created in 1961 to work in a car factory. It could be reprogrammed for different tasks.

**Example:** Unimate was like a giant robot arm that could pick up hot metal parts that would burn human workers.
