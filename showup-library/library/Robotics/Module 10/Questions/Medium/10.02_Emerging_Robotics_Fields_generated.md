# Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Soft Robotics
- How soft robots differ functionally from traditional rigid robots:
  - Ability to squeeze through tight spaces and return to original shape
  - Capacity to wrap around and handle delicate objects without damage
  - Movement mechanisms through inflation/deflation of air pockets
- Real-world applications that demonstrate comprehension of capabilities:
  - Picking delicate fruits (strawberries) without bruising them
  - Sensing ripeness and adjusting grip accordingly
  - Potential for medicine delivery inside human bodies
- Relationship between biological inspiration and engineering solutions:
  - Connection between octopus movement and robot flexibility
  - Application of worm locomotion principles to robot movement

## Swarm Robotics
- Operational principles that demonstrate system comprehension:
  - Decentralized control (no single leader) with simple rule-following
  - Communication patterns between nearby robots
  - Fault tolerance when individual units fail
- Comparative advantages over single-robot approaches:
  - Efficiency in searching large areas (like disaster zones)
  - Redundancy when individual units malfunction
  - Scalability for handling multiple simultaneous tasks
- Applied examples showing real-world implementation:
  - Formation of different shapes through coordination
  - Collaborative object movement through pushing together
  - Warehouse organization and retrieval systems

## Bio-inspired Robotics
- Classification of bio-inspiration approaches:
  - Locomotion adaptations (kangaroo hopping, dog-like walking)
  - Sensory systems (rat-like whiskers for dark navigation)
  - Balance and stability mechanisms (like Spot robot)
- Analysis of functional adaptations beyond appearance:
  - Artificial muscles that contract with electricity
  - Vision systems based on insect eye principles
  - Wing designs that enable better control than traditional drones
- Environmental applications demonstrating cause-effect relationships:
  - Fish-inspired robots for water quality monitoring
  - Cockroach-inspired designs for search and rescue in collapsed structures
  - How natural movement allows robots to blend with wildlife

## Comparative Analysis
- How different robotic approaches solve similar problems:
  - Adaptability to irregular environments across different robot types
  - Trade-offs between simplicity and capability
  - Relationships between biological models and engineering solutions
