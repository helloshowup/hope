## Input-Processing-Output Basics
- The three main steps of how robots interact with the world are:
  - Input (gathering information through sensors)
  - Processing (making decisions with a microcontroller/computer)
  - Output (taking action through motors, speakers, lights)
- Digital thermometers follow the input-processing-output model:
  - Input: temperature sensor detects body heat
  - Processing: computer chip converts sensor reading
  - Output: digital display shows temperature
- Blood pressure monitors also follow this model:
  - Input: pressure sensor detects pressure in cuff
  - Processing: circuits analyze pressure changes
  - Output: display shows systolic and diastolic readings

## Types of Sensors (Input Devices)
- Light sensors - detect brightness levels
- Distance sensors - measure how far away objects are
- Touch sensors - detect physical contact
- Color sensors - identify different colors
- Sound sensors - detect noise levels
- Temperature sensors - measure heat

## Types of Actuators (Output Devices)
- DC motors - spin wheels for movement
- Servo motors - move to precise positions
- LED lights - provide visual feedback
- Speakers - produce sounds
- LCD displays - show text and numbers

## Power Systems
- Batteries - most common for mobile robots, portable but limited energy
- Wall adapters - provide continuous power but limit mobility
- Solar panels - generate electricity from light, useful for outdoor robots

## Structural Elements
- Chassis - forms the robot's body and holds components
- Wheels, tracks, and legs - provide different movement capabilities
- Mounting brackets - secure motors, sensors, and other parts
- Materials - plastic, metal, and wood offer different combinations of weight, strength, and cost

## Programming Concepts
- Sequences - series of commands that run one after another (like a recipe)
- Loops - allow repeating actions without writing the same code multiple times:
  - Count-controlled loops (repeat a specific number of times)
  - Condition-controlled loops (repeat until something specific happens)
- Conditionals - let robots make decisions using "if-then-else" logic
- Variables - labeled containers that store information (numbers, text, true/false values)
- Functions - reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
