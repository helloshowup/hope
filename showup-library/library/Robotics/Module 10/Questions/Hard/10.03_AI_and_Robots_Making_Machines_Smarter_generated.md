## Basic AI Concepts
- AI gives robots something like a brain that can learn and make decisions
- Traditional robots can only follow exact instructions
- Robots with AI can learn from experience and adapt to new situations

## Three Main Ways AI Improves Robots
- **Better Sensing**: Helps robots understand what they see and hear
  - Example: Warehouse robots can recognize different products
- **Smarter Decisions**: Robots can figure out multiple solutions and choose the best one
  - Example: Self-driving cars use this when navigating traffic
- **Learning from Experience**: Robots improve over time through practice
  - Example: A robot assembling products learns from mistakes and gets better

## Types of Robot Learning
- **Learning with a Teacher** (Supervised Learning)
  - Robot is shown many examples of the right way to do something
  - After seeing enough examples, it can handle new situations
- **Learning from Trial and Error** (Reinforcement Learning)
  - Robots get digital "rewards" for correct actions
  - Robots get "penalties" for mistakes
  - Through practice, they figure out what works best
- **Learning to See** (Computer Vision)
  - Helps robots understand images from cameras
  - Lets them identify objects, read text, recognize faces, or detect movement

## Important Issues About Smart Robots
- **Privacy**: Home robots use cameras and microphones
  - Questions about who should access this information
- **Safety**: Making sure robots working with humans can't accidentally hurt people
- **Jobs**: Robots can take over dangerous jobs but might reduce jobs for people

## Organizations and Rules
- Countries are creating rules about how AI robots can be used
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has created guidelines
- Guidelines ensure robots are designed to benefit people and society
