# Easy-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Basic AI Concepts
- AI gives robots something like a brain that can learn and make decisions
- Traditional robots can only follow exact instructions
- Robots with AI can learn from experience and adapt to new situations

## Three Main Ways AI Improves Robots
- **Better Sensing**: Helps robots understand what they see and hear
  - Example: Warehouse robots can recognize different products
- **Smarter Decisions**: Robots can figure out multiple solutions and choose the best one
  - Example: Self-driving cars use this when navigating traffic
- **Learning from Experience**: Robots improve over time through practice
  - Example: A robot assembling products learns from mistakes and gets better

## Types of Robot Learning
- **Learning with a Teacher** (Supervised Learning)
  - Robot is shown many examples of the right way to do something
  - After seeing enough examples, it can handle new situations
- **Learning from Trial and Error** (Reinforcement Learning)
  - Robots get digital "rewards" for correct actions
  - Robots get "penalties" for mistakes
  - Through practice, they figure out what works best
- **Learning to See** (Computer Vision)
  - Helps robots understand images from cameras
  - Lets them identify objects, read text, recognize faces, or detect movement

## Important Issues About Smart Robots
- **Privacy**: Home robots use cameras and microphones
  - Questions about who should access this information
- **Safety**: Making sure robots working with humans can't accidentally hurt people
- **Jobs**: Robots can take over dangerous jobs but might reduce jobs for people

## Organizations and Rules
- Countries are creating rules about how AI robots can be used
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has created guidelines
- Guidelines ensure robots are designed to benefit people and society

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- The three main steps of how robots interact with the world:
  - **Input devices** (sensors) - gather information from surroundings
  - **Processing** - robot's "brain" makes decisions based on input
  - **Output devices** - allow robots to take action

## Types of Sensors (Input Devices)
- Light sensors - detect brightness levels
- Distance sensors - measure how far away objects are
- Touch sensors - detect physical contact
- Color sensors - identify different colors
- Sound sensors - detect noise levels
- Temperature sensors - measure heat

## Types of Actuators (Output Devices)
- DC motors - spin wheels for movement
- Servo motors - move to precise positions
- LED lights - provide visual feedback
- Speakers - produce sounds
- LCD displays - show text and numbers

## Power Systems
- Common power sources for robots:
  - Batteries - portable but limited energy storage
  - Wall adapters - continuous power but limited mobility
  - Solar panels - generate electricity from light

## Structural Elements
- Chassis - forms the robot's body and holds components
- Wheels, tracks, and legs - provide different movement capabilities
- Mounting brackets - secure motors, sensors, and other parts
- Materials - plastic, metal, and wood offer different properties

## Basic Programming Structures
- **Sequences** - series of commands that run one after another
- **Loops** - allow repeating actions without rewriting code
  - Count-controlled loops - run a specific number of times
  - Condition-controlled loops - run until something specific happens
- **Conditionals** - let robots make decisions using "if-then-else" logic

## Real-World Examples
- Digital thermometer:
  - Input: temperature sensor
  - Processing: computer chip converts reading
  - Output: digital display shows temperature
- Blood pressure monitor:
  - Input: pressure sensor
  - Processing: circuits analyze pressure changes
  - Output: display shows readings
