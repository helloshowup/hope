<h1>Emerging Robotics Fields</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name three new types of robots and how they work</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tell how each robot type solves real-world problems</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compare how these robots copy ideas from nature</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soft Robotics: Flexible and Adaptable</h3><p><strong>Soft robotics</strong> is an exciting new direction in robot design. Unlike the rigid metal robots we've learned about in previous lessons, soft robots use flexible materials that can bend and stretch, similar to rubber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These robots have amazing abilities! They can squeeze through tight spaces and then pop back to their original shape - just like an octopus squeezing through a narrow gap. <strong>Soft robots</strong> can wrap around objects and pick up delicate items without damaging them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists often look to nature for inspiration, studying animals without hard skeletons like octopuses, jellyfish, and worms. Some soft robots move by inflating and deflating air pockets in their bodies, similar to how a worm moves forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the real world, soft robots are being tested for gentle tasks like picking strawberries without bruising them. These flexible robot hands can sense how ripe a fruit is and adjust their grip accordingly. Researchers are also developing tiny soft robots that might someday deliver medicine inside the human body.</p>
<h3>Swarm Robotics: The Power of Many</h3><p><strong>Swarm robotics</strong> shows us that sometimes many simple robots can do more than one complex robot! This approach uses groups of small, basic robots that work together as a team - inspired by how ants and bees accomplish big tasks through teamwork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <strong>robot swarm</strong>, each robot follows basic rules and communicates with nearby robots. There's no single leader, but together they can solve problems efficiently. For example, a swarm of small robots could search a disaster area much faster than one large robot. If one robot stops working, the others continue the mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists have created swarms of tiny robots that can form different shapes, move objects by pushing together, and explore unknown areas. In warehouses, robot swarms help organize and retrieve items - each robot does a simple job, but together they can handle hundreds of orders every hour.</p>
<h3>Bio-inspired Robots: Learning from Nature</h3><p><strong>Bio-inspired robotics</strong> looks at animals and plants for clever design ideas. Nature has already solved many of the challenges that robot designers face today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some fascinating examples include robots that hop like kangaroos to move over rough terrain, or robots with whiskers like rats to help them navigate in the dark. You might have seen videos of <strong>Spot</strong>, a four-legged robot that walks like a dog and can keep its balance even when pushed. Other robots have wings that flap like birds or insects, giving them better control than traditional drones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bio-inspired robots</strong> aren't just copying how animals look - they're using nature's solutions to difficult problems. Some use <strong>artificial muscles</strong> that contract with electricity, similar to our own muscles. Others have vision systems based on insect eyes, which are excellent at detecting movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In oceans and lakes, fish-inspired robots help scientists monitor water quality and track pollution. These robot fish swim naturally, allowing them to blend in without disturbing marine life. For search and rescue operations, robots inspired by cockroaches can squeeze through tiny spaces in collapsed buildings to find people after disasters.</p>
