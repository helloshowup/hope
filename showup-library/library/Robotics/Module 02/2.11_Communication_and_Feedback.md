# ****Communication and Feedback****

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify the three main categories of robot communication outputs and provide examples of each.
- Explain how different robot output methods communicate information to humans in various contexts.
- Design appropriate output responses for robots in specific scenarios that address both functionality and user understanding.

##**Visual Outputs**

Visual outputs are how robots communicate information visually to humans and other systems:

**Display Screens** are common on many robots, from simple LCD displays showing basic status information to advanced touchscreens on service robots. These screens can show text, images, videos, or interactive interfaces. For example, a museum guide robot might display a map of exhibits or information about the artwork you're viewing.

**Indicator Lights** are simpler but very effective visual signals. Different colors often have standard meanings – green for "ready" or "working normally," red for "error" or "stop," and yellow for "caution" or "in process." Many robots use patterns of blinking or different intensities to communicate more complex messages. Even a simple cleaning robot might have lights to show if it's charging, cleaning, or stuck.

**Projected Displays** are becoming more common in advanced robots. These can project information onto surfaces around the robot, creating larger displays without needing a physical screen. A robot might project arrows on the floor to show which direction it's planning to move, helping people nearby understand its intentions.

Visual outputs are particularly important for robots that interact with humans regularly, as they provide immediate feedback about the robot's status and intentions without requiring sound or physical contact.

## **Audio Outputs**

Audio outputs allow robots to communicate through sound:

**Speakers** enable robots to produce a wide range of sounds, from simple beeps and tones to full speech. Voice synthesis technology has advanced significantly, allowing robots to speak in increasingly natural-sounding voices. Service robots in public spaces often use speech to provide information or answer questions.

**Alarms and Alerts** are specific sounds designed to get immediate attention. Industrial robots might use distinctive warning sounds before starting movement, while a home robot might play a gentle chime when it's completed a task.

**Musical Outputs** are used by some robots for entertainment or emotional expression. Some companion robots can play music or sing, adding to their interactive capabilities.

Audio outputs are especially valuable when visual communication isn't practical – for instance, when a person isn't looking at the robot or when the robot needs to alert someone to an urgent situation.

## **Tactile and Other Outputs**

Beyond visual and audio, robots can communicate through several other channels:

**Haptic Feedback** involves creating sensations that can be felt physically. Vibration motors (like those in game controllers or phones) allow robots to communicate through touch. A robot designed to guide visually impaired people might use vibrations to indicate direction or obstacles.

**Temperature Changes** can be used as a form of output in specialized applications. Some advanced robots can control their surface temperature to communicate information or create specific experiences when touched.

**Smell Outputs** are rare but exist in specialized robots. Some research robots can release specific scents for applications in retail, entertainment, or therapy.

**Air Movement** can be another form of output, with fans or air jets creating detectable changes. A robot might use gentle air movement to signal its presence without physical contact.

These alternative output methods are particularly valuable when designing robots for people with sensory limitations or for specialized environments where traditional visual or audio outputs might not be effective.

## Key Takeaways
- Robots communicate through three main ways: visual outputs (like screens and lights), audio outputs (like sounds and speech), and tactile outputs (like vibrations you can feel).
- Different output methods work best in different situations - visual for quick information, audio when someone isn't looking at the robot, and tactile for people who might have trouble seeing or hearing.
- Robots choose their communication method based on what they need to tell people and who they're working with.

## **Activity 2: Output Scenario Design**

For this activity, imagine you're designing a robot that must respond to three scenarios: encountering an unexpected obstacle, successfully completing a designated task, and detecting a potential safety hazard. Create a brief outline of what output responses would be appropriate in each scenario, considering both functional requirements and human understanding of the robot's status.
