# 2.1.11 Understanding the Output Scenario Design Activity

## Purpose of the Activity

The "Output Scenario Design" activity lets you apply what you've learned about how robots communicate to real-world situations. This activity has several important learning goals:

1. **Using What You've Learned**: You'll take what you know about lights, sounds, and touch-based robot outputs and apply them to specific robot situations.

2. **Building Thinking Skills**: By choosing different ways for robots to communicate in each scenario, you'll develop your ability to decide which methods work best in different situations.

3. **Understanding How Robots Talk to Humans**: This activity helps you understand how robots need to share their status, intentions, and warnings with people in ways that make sense.

4. **Practicing Design Skills**: You'll try out a simple design process, thinking about both the technical needs and human factors in robot communication.

## What You'll Do

In this activity, you will:

1. **Look at Each Scenario**: For each situation, think about what message the robot needs to send (like "Watch out!" or "Task complete!").

2. **Design Robot Outputs**: For each scenario, create specific ways the robot could communicate using:

- **Visual outputs** (lights, screens, colors)
- **Audio outputs** (beeps, spoken words, tones)
- **Touch or other outputs** (vibration, movement)

3. **Think About the Setting**: Consider where the robot is being used and who might be around it. Would your communication method work well in that environment?

4. **Answer Thinking Questions**: Use the questions to explore how different environments and users affect your design choices.

## Example
Imagine a robot vacuum that detects it's stuck under furniture:

- **Visual output**: Flashing red light on top
- **Audio output**: Three short beeps repeated every 30 seconds
- **Touch output**: Robot gently bumps against the obstacle

## What Happens Next

After you finish this activity:

1. **Share Your Ideas**: You'll have a chance to see how other students designed their robot communications and discuss what makes some designs better than others.

This activity connects what you've learned about robot communication with real-world applications, helping you develop skills for designing effective robot communication systems.
