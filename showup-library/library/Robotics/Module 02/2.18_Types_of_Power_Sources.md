# **Types of Power Sources**

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify at least four different **power sources** used in robotics
- Compare the advantages and limitations of various **robot power technologies**
- Explain how a robot's **power source** affects its design and functionality

### **Battery Technologies**
Robots can be powered in many different ways, each with its own good points and limits. The best **power source** depends on what the robot needs to do, where it will work, and how long it needs to run without recharging or refueling.

**Batteries** are the most common way to power robots that move around because they store energy that can be used anywhere. Here are some types of batteries used in robotics:

**Lithium-ion batteries** are popular in many robots because they hold a lot of energy in a small, light package. These are the same batteries used in cell phones and laptops. They can be recharged hundreds of times and give steady power. But they can be expensive and might get too hot if damaged.

**Alkaline batteries** (like AA or AAA batteries) are sometimes used in simple or school robots. They're cheap and easy to find but can't be recharged and don't last very long for robots that need a lot of power.

**Lead-acid batteries**, like the ones in cars, are heavier but cheaper than lithium-ion. They're often used in bigger robots that don't need to be very light, such as some robot lawnmowers.

Scientists are always creating newer battery types. For example, **solid-state batteries** promise to be safer and hold more energy than today's lithium-ion batteries. Some test robots even use **biological batteries** that work like how living things make energy!

### **Direct Power Connections**

Some robots don't use batteries at all - instead, they plug right into a power outlet. These robots are called **"tethered"** because they're connected by a power cord.

**Tethered robots** have some big advantages. They never run out of power and can work non-stop for as long as needed. They can also use parts that need more power since they don't have to save battery life. Factory robots that work in the same spot all day often use direct power connections.

The main downside is clear - they can't move around much! A tethered robot can only go as far as its power cord reaches. This makes tethered power best for robots that stay in one place or work in a small area. The cord can also get in the way or become tangled.

Some robots use a mix of both approaches, running on battery power but automatically going back to a **charging station** when their batteries get low. This gives them freedom to move while fixing the problem of limited battery life.

### **Alternative and Renewable Power Sources**

Engineers are developing cool new ways to power robots that are better for the environment and can work in faraway places:

**Solar-powered robots** use panels that turn sunlight into electricity. These robots can possibly work for very long times in sunny places without needing to recharge. NASA's Mars rovers use solar panels to power their exploration of the red planet. The drawback is that they need sunlight to work well.

**Fuel cells** make electricity through chemical reactions, often using hydrogen. They can provide more power than batteries of the same weight and can be refilled quickly. Some test delivery robots use fuel cells to work longer between charges.

**Energy harvesting technologies** let robots generate power from their surroundings. This might include collecting energy from the robot's own movements, temperature differences, or even from radio waves in the air. While these methods usually don't make much power, they can help a robot work longer.

**Wireless power transfer** is a new technology that lets robots get power without being plugged in. Special charging pads or stations send energy through the air, which the robot can collect. This technology is still being developed but could someday allow robots to charge automatically as they work.

**CHECKPOINT:** How might a robot's **power source** limit or expand its potential applications? Consider a robot designed for deep sea exploration - what power constraints would it face and how would these constraints affect its design and functionality?

## **Key Takeaways**
- A robot's **power source** affects where it can work and for how long - batteries allow robots to move freely but eventually need recharging, while plugged-in robots can work non-stop but can't move far.
- Different robot jobs need different **power sources** - small indoor robots typically use batteries, factory robots that stay in one place use direct power connections, and outdoor robots might use solar power.
- Engineers are creating new ways to power robots that don't need to be plugged in or have batteries changed, like **solar panels** and systems that collect energy from the environment.
