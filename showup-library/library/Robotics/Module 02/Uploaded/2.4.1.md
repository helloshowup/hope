### 2.4.1 Hands-On Activity: Human vs. Robot Systems

Now that you've explored how robots function as systems, it's time to connect what you've learned to something you're already familiar with—your own body\!

#### Why We're Doing This

Robots and humans have a lot in common when it comes to how we sense, think, and act. This activity will help you compare **human body systems** to **robot components**, so you can see how robots mimic (or differ from) the way people work.

### Instructions: Complete the Comparison Chart

1. **Open the Chart**  
     
   * Download or open the **“Human vs. Robot Systems Comparison Chart”** (linked above or in your course materials).

   

2. **Look at Each Human System**  
     
   * You’ll see body systems like the **skeletal system**, **nervous system**, **digestive system**, and more.

   

3. **Match to Robot Systems**  
     
   * For each one, think about:  
       
     * **What does this body system do for humans?**  
     * **What kind of robot system does the same job?**  
     * **What parts or components help robots do that?**  
     * **Where do you see this in real-world robots?**

   

4. **Use What You’ve Learned**  
     
   * Refer to your lesson notes about:  
       
     * **Input systems** (sensors like cameras or bump sensors)  
     * **Processing systems** (microcontrollers and programs)  
     * **Output systems** (motors, grippers, screens)  
     * **Power systems** (batteries, solar panels)

     

   * Use the robot examples from earlier (like the delivery robot, industrial arm, or toy robot) to help fill in the “real robot” column.

   

5. **Write Simply and Clearly**  
     
   * Use short, clear phrases. Bullet points are okay\!  
   * Use your own words—don’t just copy from the lesson.

### Example:

**Human System:** *Nervous System*   
**Robot Function:** Processes information and makes decisions   
**Robot Components:** Microcontroller, software, memory   
**Real Robot Example:** Industrial robot arm calculating movement path

### Reflection Time

After filling out the chart, read the reflection questions at the bottom of the page:

* Think about what’s hard for robots to copy from humans.  
* Imagine what cool systems robots could have that humans don’t\!  
* Jot down your answers in full sentences.

### You're Done When:

* Every row in the chart has something written in each column.  
* You've answered all 4 reflection questions thoughtfully.
