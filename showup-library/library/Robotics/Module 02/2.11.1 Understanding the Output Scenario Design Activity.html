<h2>Purpose of the Activity</h2>
<p>The "Output Scenario Design" activity lets you apply what you've learned about how robots communicate to real-world situations. This activity has several important learning goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Using What You've Learned</strong>: You'll take what you know about lights, sounds, and touch-based robot outputs and apply them to specific robot situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building Thinking Skills</strong>: By choosing different ways for robots to communicate in each scenario, you'll develop your ability to decide which methods work best in different situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding How Robots Talk to Humans</strong>: This activity helps you understand how robots need to share their status, intentions, and warnings with people in ways that make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practicing Design Skills</strong>: You'll try out a simple design process, thinking about both the technical needs and human factors in robot communication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>What You'll Do</h2>
<p>In this activity, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Look at Each Scenario</strong>: For each situation, think about what message the robot needs to send (like "Watch out!" or "Task complete!").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Robot Outputs</strong>: For each scenario, create specific ways the robot could communicate using:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual outputs</strong> (lights, screens, colors)</li>
<li><strong>Audio outputs</strong> (beeps, spoken words, tones)</li>
<li><strong>Touch or other outputs</strong> (vibration, movement)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Think About the Setting</strong>: Consider where the robot is being used and who might be around it. Would your communication method work well in that environment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Answer Thinking Questions</strong>: Use the questions to explore how different environments and users affect your design choices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Imagine a robot vacuum that detects it's stuck under furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual output</strong>: Flashing red light on top</li>
<li><strong>Audio output</strong>: Three short beeps repeated every 30 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Touch output</strong>: Robot gently bumps against the obstacle</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Happens Next</h2>
<p>After you finish this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Share Your Ideas</strong>: You'll have a chance to see how other students designed their robot communications and discuss what makes some designs better than others.</li>
</ol>
<p>This activity connects what you've learned about robot communication with real-world applications, helping you develop skills for designing effective robot communication systems.</p>
