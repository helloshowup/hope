    <h1>2.2  Robot Anatomy: How Robots Sense, Think, and Act</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Explain how the input-processing-output model applies to robotic systems</li>
    <li>Identify the three main components of a robot and provide examples of each</li>
    <li>Analyze everyday devices using the input-processing-output framework</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Input-Processing-Output Model</h2>
<p>The input-processing-output model is like a recipe for how systems work. Just as a recipe has ingredients (inputs), cooking steps (processing), and a finished dish (output), systems follow this same pattern. This model helps us understand how robots and other systems function in a step-by-step way.</p>

<p>This model is especially useful for understanding robots because it breaks down their complex behavior into three simpler parts that we can study one at a time. Let's explore each part of this model in detail.</p>

<h2>Input: Gathering Information</h2>
<p>Inputs are all the ways a robot gathers information from its environment. Think of inputs as the robot's senses - similar to how we use our eyes, ears, and sense of touch to understand what's happening around us.</p>

<p>Robots use special devices called sensors to collect this information. Some common robot sensors include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cameras that act like eyes, allowing robots to "see" objects, colors, and movement</li>
    <li>Microphones that work like ears, letting robots "hear" sounds and voice commands</li>
    <li>Touch sensors that detect when the robot bumps into something, like our sense of touch</li>
    <li>Distance sensors that use sound waves or light to measure how far away objects are</li>
    <li>Light sensors that can tell how bright or dark it is</li>
    <li>Temperature sensors that measure how hot or cold things are</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a robot vacuum cleaner uses sensors to detect walls, furniture, and stairs so it doesn't bump into things or fall down steps. A weather robot might use temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and barometers to collect data about current weather conditions.</p>

<p>Without inputs, a robot would be like a person with no senses - unable to respond to its environment or make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>Processing: Making Decisions</h2>
<p>Processing is what happens after a robot collects information through its inputs. This is like the robot's "brain" thinking about what to do with the information it has gathered.</p>

<p>Inside most robots is a small computer called a microcontroller or processor. This computer runs programs (sets of instructions) that tell the robot how to interpret the information from its sensors and decide what actions to take. Here's what happens during processing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The robot receives data from its sensors (inputs)</li>
    <li>The processor analyzes this data using its programming</li>
    <li>The processor makes decisions based on this analysis</li>
    <li>The processor sends commands to the robot's output devices</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, when a robot vacuum's sensors detect a wall, its processor calculates that it needs to change direction. A more complex robot might use artificial intelligence to learn from past experiences and make better decisions over time.</p>

<p>The quality of a robot's processing determines how "smart" it seems. A robot with simple processing might just follow basic if-then rules (if sensor detects wall, then turn), while advanced robots can handle complex situations and adapt to new environments.</p>

<h2>Output: Taking Action</h2>
<p>Outputs are all the ways a robot affects or changes its environment. After the robot has gathered information through its inputs and decided what to do through processing, it uses its output devices to take action.</p>

<p>Common robot output devices include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Motors that make wheels turn or arms move</li>
    <li>Speakers that produce sounds or speech</li>
    <li>Lights that can turn on, off, or change colors</li>
    <li>Displays that show text or images</li>
    <li>Grippers or tools that can manipulate objects</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, after a robot vacuum's processor decides to change direction when it detects a wall, it sends signals to its wheel motors (outputs) to turn and move in a new direction. A robot designed to help people might speak through a speaker to provide information or flash lights to get attention.</p>

<p>Outputs are what make robots useful - without them, a robot could sense its environment and think about what to do, but it couldn't actually do anything to accomplish tasks or communicate with us.</p>

                    <p> Think about your morning routine. How does it represent a system with inputs, processing, and outputs? Consider what information you take in, how you process it, and what actions result.</p>
