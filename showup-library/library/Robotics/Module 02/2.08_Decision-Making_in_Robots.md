# ****Decision-Making in Robots****

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Explain how robots use logic patterns and decision trees to make decisions based on sensor inputs
- Identify at least three challenges robots face when processing information in real-time environments
- Compare different levels of robot intelligence from reactive to autonomous systems

## **Logic Patterns and Decision Trees**

Robots use structured logic patterns to make decisions. One of the most common patterns is the **decision tree** - a flowchart-like structure that maps out different possible choices based on specific conditions.

In a decision tree, the robot starts at the top and follows branches down based on whether certain conditions are true or false. For example, a robot might start by checking if there's an obstacle ahead. If yes, it follows one branch (maybe checking if there's space to the left). If no, it follows a different branch (maybe continuing forward).

Other common logic patterns include:
- **If-Then-Else statements**: "If condition is true, do action A; otherwise, do action B"
- **Case statements**: "Depending on which of these specific values I detect, do the corresponding action"
- **While loops**: "Keep doing this action as long as this condition remains true"

These logic patterns can be combined to create complex behaviors. For instance, a robot might use a decision tree to decide which room to clean next, while using if-then statements to avoid bumping into furniture within each room.

Decision trees are especially useful for visualizing and planning robot behaviors because they show clearly how different conditions lead to different actions.

## **Real-Time Processing Challenges**

Robots often need to make decisions quickly in changing environments, which creates several challenges:

**Speed** is critical - a self-driving car needs to detect and respond to a child running into the street in a fraction of a second. This requires powerful processors that can analyze sensor data and make decisions almost instantly.

Robots must handle unexpected situations. The real world is messy and unpredictable, so robots need to process information and make reasonable decisions even when they encounter something they weren't specifically programmed for.

Multiple sensors create large amounts of data that must be processed simultaneously. For example, a robot might need to combine information from cameras, distance sensors, and touch sensors all at once to navigate safely.

Limited processing power means robots sometimes have to prioritize which information is most important. A robot might focus first on detecting obstacles that could cause damage, and only then consider less critical factors like optimizing its path.

Engineers address these challenges by using faster processors, more efficient algorithms, and sometimes by dividing processing tasks among multiple specialized systems that work together.

## **Intelligence Levels in Robot Processing**

Robots can be categorized by their level of intelligence, which directly relates to how they process information:

**Reactive robots** are the simplest. They respond directly to sensor inputs without any memory or planning. They follow fixed rules like "if touch sensor is pressed, back up and turn." Most simple toy robots and basic industrial robots are reactive.

**Deliberative robots** can plan ahead and consider the consequences of their actions. They maintain an internal model of their environment and can think several steps ahead. A chess-playing robot is deliberative because it considers many possible moves and their outcomes before deciding.

**Learning robots** can improve their performance over time based on experience. They might start with basic programming but then adapt their behavior based on what works well and what doesn't. A robot vacuum that creates better cleaning paths after mapping your home is showing simple learning behavior.

**Autonomous robots** combine all these capabilities and can operate independently for extended periods with minimal human supervision. Self-driving cars and advanced research robots fall into this category.

The most sophisticated robots today use artificial intelligence techniques like neural networks to process information in ways that mimic aspects of human thinking. These systems can recognize patterns, adapt to new situations, and even demonstrate creativity in problem-solving.

For example, a light sensor in a robot vacuum might detect that it's getting dark, but the robot needs to interpret what that means. Is it entering a shadowy area under furniture, or is it nighttime? A simple reactive robot might just turn on its lights. A more intelligent robot with multiple sensors might check its internal clock, compare readings from other light sensors, and then decide whether it's under furniture (continue cleaning with lights on) or if it's nighttime (return to charging station to avoid disturbing sleeping humans).


## **Activity 2: Decision Tree Design**

Create a simple flowchart showing how a robot would make decisions when navigating a maze. Your decision tree should include at least three decision points where the robot must choose between multiple actions based on sensor inputs. Include conditions like "if path blocked on left" and resulting actions like "turn right." Draw this on paper or use an online flowchart tool.

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how a robot's processing needs might change depending on whether it works in a controlled factory environment versus an unpredictable outdoor setting. What additional processing capabilities would be necessary for the outdoor robot?

Which statement best describes the relationship between a robot's programming and its decision-making process?

A. Programming is only needed for advanced robots with artificial intelligence

B. Programming provides the rules and logic for how a robot processes information and makes decisions

C. Programming only affects the output devices and has no impact on decision-making

D. Programming automatically adjusts based on the robot's experiences without human intervention
---answer---
The correct answer is B. Programming provides the rules and logic for how a robot processes information and makes decisions. Programming provides the fundamental rules, logic, and instructions that guide how a robot processes information from its input devices and determines appropriate responses. Without programming, a robot cannot interpret sensor data or decide on actions. If you chose a different answer, remember that all robots require programming for decision-making, not just advanced ones, and programming doesn't automatically self-adjust without human intervention.
