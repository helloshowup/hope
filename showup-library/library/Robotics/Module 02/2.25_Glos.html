<hr>

<h2>Calibration</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The process of adjusting a robot's sensors to ensure they provide accurate readings.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Just like you might adjust your game controller settings, robots need calibration to make sure their sensors work correctly.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Carbon Fiber</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A strong, lightweight material made from thin carbon threads, used for robot parts that need to be both strong and light.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Racing drones use carbon fiber frames because they're super strong but weigh less than metal frames.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Circular Design</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Creating robots with parts that can be easily repaired, reused, or recycled instead of thrown away.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  A circular design robot has batteries you can replace without throwing away the whole robot.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Closed-loop Control</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A system where robots use sensor feedback to check if movements were done correctly and make adjustments.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  When you ride a bike and adjust your steering to stay balanced, you're using closed-loop control just like robots do.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Instructions written in a special language that tell a robot what to do.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Writing code for a robot is like writing a recipe that tells it exactly how to complete a task step by step.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  When different robot parts can work together properly without problems.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Just like not all chargers fit all phones, robot parts need to be compatible to connect and communicate correctly.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Component</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Any individual part that makes up a robot system.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  A robot has many components like motors, sensors, and a controller - similar to how a bike has wheels, pedals, and handlebars.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Composite Material</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A material made by combining two or more different materials to get better properties than either one alone.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Fiberglass is a composite material used in boats and some robots because it's strong, lightweight, and waterproof.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Computer Vision</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Technology that allows robots to understand and interpret visual information from cameras.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Computer vision helps a robot identify objects in a room, similar to how you recognize your friends in photos.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Connection</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  How robot parts are joined together, either physically with wires or wirelessly.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  The connections between your game controller and console must work properly, just like connections between robot parts.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Controller</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The main board that acts as the robot's brain, processing information and sending commands.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  The controller in a drone receives your commands and tells the motors how fast to spin, just like your brain tells your body what to do.</p>
<hr>

<h2>DC Motor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A common motor that converts electrical energy into continuous rotational movement.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  DC motors power the wheels on a remote-controlled car, making it move forward and backward.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Decision Tree</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A flowchart-like structure that maps out different choices a robot can make based on specific conditions.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  A robot might use a decision tree like: "If path blocked on left, then turn right; if clear, go forward."</p>
<hr>

<h2>Deliberative Robot</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A robot that can plan ahead and consider the consequences of its actions before deciding what to do.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  A chess-playing robot thinks several moves ahead before deciding where to move, just like a good chess player.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Design for Disassembly</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Creating robots that can be easily taken apart for repair or recycling when they're no longer needed.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  A robot designed for disassembly uses screws instead of glue so parts can be separated for recycling.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Diagnostic</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The process of finding what's wrong with a robot that isn't working correctly.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  When your bike chain falls off, you diagnose the problem by checking the chain and gears before fixing it.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Durability</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  How well a robot or its parts can withstand wear, damage, and harsh conditions over time.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Outdoor robots need high durability to handle rain, sun, and temperature changes without breaking.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Electronic Connection</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The way electrical signals travel between robot parts through wires or wireless signals.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  When you press a button on a video game controller, an electronic connection sends that signal to the console.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Emergency Stop</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A safety feature that immediately shuts down a robot in dangerous situations.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  When you press the big red emergency stop button, the robot arm freezes instantly to prevent accidents.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Energy Harvesting</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Collecting small amounts of energy from the environment, like light, movement, or heat, to power a robot.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  Some watches use energy harvesting from your arm movements instead of batteries.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Environmental Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A device that detects conditions like temperature, light, or sound in a robot's surroundings.<br>

<hr>

<h2>Fail-safe</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A backup system that keeps a robot safe even if something goes wrong with the main system.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  If a flying drone's main computer fails, its fail-safe system makes it land safely instead of crashing.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Information a robot receives about the results of its actions, used to make corrections or improvements.<br>
<strong>Example:</strong>  When you're too cold and put on a jacket, feeling warmer is feedback that your action worked.</p>
