# **Robot Power and Energy**

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Explain how different robots use various power sources based on their specific functions and requirements
- Compare the advantages and limitations of at least three common robot power sources
- Analyze how a robot's design and intended use determines its power and energy needs

### **Lesson Podcast Discussion: Comparing Power Sources in Modern Robotics**

Think about a tiny robot exploring Mars, a surgical robot in a hospital, and a giant factory robot assembling cars. Each of these robots needs power to work, but they get their power in very different ways! In this podcast, we explore how robots are powered and why the right power source matters so much.

Just like you need food for energy, robots need power to move, think, and do their jobs. Some robots plug into the wall, others use batteries like your toys, and some cool robots even use solar panels like calculators! The way a robot gets its power affects where it can go, how long it can work, and what jobs it can do. A robot vacuum with a small battery might only clean for an hour, while a factory robot plugged into the wall can work all day and night.

Throughout this discussion, we'll look at real robots and see how engineers choose the best power source for each job. We'll also look into the future to see exciting new ways robots might be powered, like using hydrogen fuel cells or even getting energy from their surroundings!

## **Robot Power Fundamentals**

Robots need power to work, just like humans need food for energy. Power in robotics means the electrical energy that makes everything work - from the computer "brain" to the motors that help robots move. Understanding how robots use power helps us build better, more efficient machines.

### **Energy Requirements in Robots**

Different robots need different amounts of power, depending on what they do. A small robot toy might only need a little power from small batteries, while a large industrial robot that lifts heavy objects needs much more power.

Several things affect how much energy a robot uses. The robot's **size** matters - bigger robots usually need more power. What the robot **does** is also important - moving around, lifting things, and processing information all need different amounts of energy. For example, a robot arm that lifts heavy boxes in a warehouse uses more power than a small robot that just follows lines on the floor.

Engineers figure out a robot's power needs by adding up how much electricity each part needs. **Motors** that move the robot often need the most power, while **sensors** that help the robot "see" or "feel" might need very little. By understanding these needs, engineers can pick the right power source and make sure the robot has enough energy to do its job.

### **Power Distribution Systems**

Once a robot has a power source, the electricity needs to get to all its different parts. This happens through the **power distribution system**, which works like the electrical wiring in your home.

Most robots have a **main power bus**, which is like a highway for electricity that connects to all parts of the robot. Different parts in a robot often need different voltage levels - sensors might need 5 volts, while motors might need 12 volts or more. **Voltage regulators** help change the main power to the right levels for each part, similar to how adapters work for different devices in your home.

Some robots have systems that decide which parts get power first when energy is limited. For example, a robot might reduce power to less important systems like displays when its battery is low, but keep important systems like its computer running. This is similar to how your phone might dim the screen when the battery is low to save power.

### **Energy Consumption Patterns**

Robots use different amounts of power at different times. Understanding these patterns helps engineers design better power systems.

During operation, robots often have **peak power demands** - times when they need a lot of energy all at once. This might happen when a robot starts moving or lifts something heavy. Between these peaks, robots usually use less power during normal operation. When robots aren't actively working, they might go into **standby mode**, using very little power while waiting for the next task.

Many robots go through **operational cycles** - repeated patterns of activity. For example, a robot vacuum might use more power when it's cleaning carpet than when it's on hard floors. It might use even more power when it needs to climb over a bump between rooms. By studying these patterns, engineers can design power systems that handle peak demands while being efficient during normal operation.

## **Key Takeaways**
- Robots use different power sources (batteries, wall plugs, or solar panels) based on their function, with each power source affecting where robots can go and how long they can work.
- A robot's size and tasks determine how much energy it needs - larger robots or those doing heavy lifting require more power than smaller robots with simpler tasks.
- Robots distribute electricity through power systems similar to home wiring, with different components often needing different voltage levels to function properly.
