An overview of project planning

## 

Effective project planning is the backbone of successful graphic design projects.   
It enables designers to manage resources, timelines, and deliverables efficiently.  
Utilising project planning tools and techniques ensures that creative goals align with client expectations and that every stage of the process runs smoothly.  
Project planning is essentially \- a roadmap from concept to completion. 

Take for example the creation of **London’s 2012 Olympics logo**. This project had high-profile demands and tight deadlines.   
But \- proper planning ensured a cohesive visual identity that resonated globally \- emphasising the value of structured approaches in delivering impactful designs.

### Let’s take a look at an Overview of Essential Project Planning Tools

#### First \- Gantt Charts

A Gantt chart is a timeline-based visual planning tool that outlines tasks, their duration, and dependencies.   
Using a **Gantt chart** in a branding project for example \- means tasks like research, logo creation, and final approval can be visually tracked.   
Tools like Microsoft Project or online options like Smartsheet, allow designers to easily create and interpret Gantt charts, ensuring every task is completed on schedule.

#### Another option is to use **Kanban Board**s. Kanban boards \- popularised by tools like Trello and Asana \- use a card-based system to manage tasks. 

Each card represents a task and *moves* across stages such as,"To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."   
For example \- During a web design project, cards can track stages such as wireframing, prototyping, and final deployment.   
Kanban boards make it easy to manage workloads and visually track your progress.

### Those are some tools \- let’s have a quick look at some techniques for estimating project timelines and resources

#### First and foremost is how to break down tasks. Rather than becoming overwhelmed with the size of a project \-  begin by dividing the project into smaller, more manageable tasks. 

Sometimes reverse planning can be helpful. This involves assessing the end point or delivery date and working back from that point in time to the current point in time.  
Say for example you are designing a promotional flyer? This can involve research, concept sketches, drafting, and revisions. This breakdown helps estimate the time and resources needed for each stage.

#### Then you will need to remember to allow for Buffer Time. This is to cover inevitable unexpected delays. A good rule of thumb is to add 10-15% extra time to each task’s estimated duration. 

So in the example of an illustration project \- buffer time can cover unforeseen revisions or technical hiccups.

#### Finally \- a vital step in project planning is Resource Allocation. Use tools like resource planners or spreadsheets to assign tasks to team members based on their skills. So \- you would assign a  typographer for text layout to ensure efficient resource usage and to reduce bottlenecks.

### 

By employing tools like Gantt charts and Kanban boards \- and applying effective planning techniques, graphic designers can navigate complex projects with confidence. These methods not only enhance productivity but also ensure the delivery of high-quality results that meet client expectations and deadlines.
