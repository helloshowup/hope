# Multiple-Choice Test: Coffee Rebranding Case Study

## Question 1
During the initial project briefing phase, which of the following is NOT explicitly mentioned as a key goal for the Cold Brew coffee brand project?

A) Conveying premium quality
B) Establishing competitive pricing strategies
C) Communicating eco-friendly ethos
D) Creating packaging for artisanal coffee beans

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The case study specifically mentions that key goals include "conveying the brand's premium quality and eco-friendly ethos." Pricing strategies are not discussed as part of the project objectives, which focus on brand identity and visual communication rather than business strategy.

## Question 2
What is the primary purpose of creating a mood board during the Research and Inspiration Gathering phase?

A) To present final design concepts to the client
B) To compile imagery, textures, and colour schemes that inform the design direction
C) To document competitor pricing strategies
D) To establish project timelines and budgets

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The case study states that during the research phase, designers "Create a mood board with imagery, textures, and colour schemes." This visual collection serves as inspiration and helps establish the aesthetic direction for the project.

## Question 3
In the context of this case study, why would a designer analyse competitors' designs during the research phase?

A) To copy successful design elements directly
B) To understand market pricing for similar services
C) To identify strengths and weaknesses in existing designs
D) To determine production costs for packaging

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The case study specifically mentions analysing "competitors' designs for strengths and weaknesses." This competitive analysis helps designers understand what works in the market and identify opportunities for differentiation.

## Question 4
During the Concept Development and Sketching phase, the designer's approach is described as "exploratory." What does this suggest about the design process at this stage?

A) Only one refined idea should be developed
B) Multiple rough ideas should be generated for later refinement
C) Final designs should be completed in this phase
D) Client approval is required before proceeding

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The case study explicitly states that this stage "focuses on generating multiple rough ideas to later refine." The exploratory nature emphasises breadth of ideas rather than depth of execution at this point.

## Question 5
Which software tools are specifically mentioned for the Design Execution phase?

A) Pinterest and Behance
B) Microsoft Word and Excel
C) Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
D) Sketch and Figma

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The case study specifically names "Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop" as the industry-standard software used for digitising concepts and creating vector logos and packaging mockups.

## Question 6
What type of file format would most likely be included in the "AI" format mentioned in the final delivery?

A) Artificial Intelligence data files
B) Adobe Illustrator vector files
C) Audio Interface files
D) Animated Image files

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** In the context of graphic design deliverables, "AI" refers to Adobe Illustrator files, which are vector-based and allow for scalable logo and design elements. This aligns with the software mentioned earlier in the case study.

## Question 7
If a client requests "adjustments to the logo's typography" during the feedback phase, what aspect of the design are they asking to modify?

A) The colour scheme of the logo
B) The style and appearance of the text/lettering
C) The symbolic imagery in the logo
D) The size of the packaging

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Typography refers to the style, arrangement, and appearance of text. When clients request typography adjustments, they're asking for changes to fonts, letter spacing, or text styling rather than other design elements.

## Question 8
Why is it important to show "how the branding works across different mediums" in the final presentation?

A) To increase the project budget
B) To demonstrate the versatility and consistency of the design system
C) To extend project timelines
D) To avoid client feedback

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Showing designs across different mediums demonstrates that the branding is cohesive and functional whether applied to packaging, digital platforms, or other materials. This proves the design's versatility and professional application.

## Question 9
Based on the case study, which sequence best represents the correct order of the design process?

A) Design Execution → Research → Client Feedback → Concept Development
B) Research → Concept Development → Design Execution → Client Feedback
C) Client Feedback → Research → Design Execution → Concept Development
D) Concept Development → Client Feedback → Research → Design Execution

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The case study presents the steps in order: Research and Inspiration Gathering (Step 2), Concept Development and Sketching (Step 3), Design Execution (Step 4), and Client Feedback and Revisions (Step 5). This follows the logical progression from exploration to refinement.

## Question 10
What distinguishes the "usage guidelines" mentioned in the final delivery from the design files themselves?

A) Usage guidelines are less important than design files
B) Usage guidelines explain how to properly implement and maintain brand consistency
C) Usage guidelines are only needed for social media
D) Usage guidelines replace the need for high-resolution files

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Usage guidelines are documentation that explains how to correctly use the brand elements (logos, colours, typography) across different applications. They ensure brand consistency and proper implementation, complementing the actual design files rather than replacing them.
