## Introduction

One reason brands update their logo is to maintain relevance and reflect their evolving identity. As market trends, consumer preferences, and design technologies change over time, graphic designs in a logo or packaging that once seemed modern, may now appear outdated, disconnected or often irrelevant.   
Refreshing a logo allows brands to signal growth, innovation, or a shift in direction, helping them stay competitive and resonate with both existing and new audiences. Another reason for a design update might be to address more practical needs, such as improving logo visibility and adaptability in digital spaces (e.g. websites and mobile apps). A redesigned logo can simplify complex elements, ensuring clarity of smaller sizes and across a range of platforms. Beyond aesthetics, a brand’s design update often accompanies broader brand strategies, like mergers, expansions, or repositioning efforts.

## Case Study

Founded in 2005 and launched in 2007, Chobani is a popular Greek yoghurt brand in the U.S., created by Turkish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya after acquiring a defunct yoghurt factory in upstate New York. Under his leadership, Chobani became the top-selling yoghurt brand in the U.S. and earned a place as the preferred Greek yoghurt. By 2012, Chobani's remarkable growth led to it becoming an official sponsor of the U.S. Olympic Team. In 2017, they redesigned the look and packaging of their brand:

## Over to you…

In the following task, you will critically analyse and compare the Chobani 2017 design with its earlier version, and suggest actionable improvements to enhance its effectiveness and appeal even more. By evaluating the current design's use of elements and principles, you will identify areas that can be optimised to better communicate the intended message or purpose. 

1. Examine the differences between the "before" and "after" Chobani designs and answer the following questions:  
* What specific design elements (e.g. typography, colour, imagery, layout) have been modified?  
* How have the design principles (e.g. balance, contrast, hierarchy, unity, etc.) been applied differently in the new version?


2. Critically assess the changes and answer the following questions:  
* Are the changes successful in improving functionality, aesthetics, or communication? Why or why not?  
* How effectively does the "after" design address the intended audience or purpose compared to the "before" design?

3. Using learned design principles, suggest potential enhancements to the "after" design:  
* What additional changes could further improve the design?  
* How would these changes enhance the message, usability, or overall impact?

This exercise aims to enhance critical analysis skills and application of design principles in real-world scenarios. You are encouraged to answer the above comparison, evaluation, and proposal questions and save your responses in digital format for future reference.
