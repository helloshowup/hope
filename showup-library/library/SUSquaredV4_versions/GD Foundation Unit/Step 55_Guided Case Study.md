## Introduction

In this guided case study, you will see how the design process translates from theory to practice in a real-world context, using a coffee rebranding as an example. The design process (i.e. research, define, ideate, prototype, and test) serves as a structured approach to solving creative graphic design challenges, ensuring that designs are purposeful, impactful, and focused on the client and their requirements. 

Through looking at a hypothetical company called “Cold Brew”, this case study is an example of how professional designers approach a project from start to finish, navigating constraints, addressing client needs, and refining ideas to deliver innovative solutions. This hands-on exploration will not only deepen your understanding of the design process but also inspire you to apply these principles to your own creative projects.

## Detailed walkthrough of a real-world graphic design project

### Step 1: Analysing the project brief

The project begins with a comprehensive briefing from the client. In this example, the client is the owner of a boutique coffee brand. They need branding and packaging for a new line of artisanal coffee beans. The key goals for the project include conveying the brand’s premium quality and eco-friendly ethos. 

During this step, the designer meets with the client to understand their vision, target audience, and key deliverables.

To-do list for this step:

* Clarify project objectives.  
* Define deliverables: logo, packaging, and social media visuals.  
* Establish timelines and budget.

### Step 2: Research and Inspiration Gathering

Next, the designer conducts research on the coffee industry, competitors, and design trends. They explore design styles that resonate with the target audience (identified in Step 1), such as minimalist aesthetics and earthy colour palettes. The designer also collects inspiration from a variety of sources, including Pinterest, Behance, and packaging stores.

To-do list for this step:

* Analyse competitors’ designs for strengths and weaknesses.  
* Create a mood board with imagery, textures, and colour schemes.

### Step 3: Concept Development and Sketching

Based on the research, the designer begins brainstorming ideas and sketching initial concepts for the logo and packaging layout. This stage is exploratory and focuses on generating multiple rough ideas to later refine.

To-do list for this step:

* Sketch potential logos incorporating coffee-related symbolism.  
* Develop layout ideas for packaging, considering elements like text placement and graphic illustrations.

### Step 4: Design Execution Using Industry-Standard Software

Once the strongest concepts are chosen, the designer digitises them using software like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. This stage involves creating vector logos, applying the chosen colour palette, and designing packaging mockups.

To-do list for this step:

* Digitise the selected logo design and refine the typography.  
* Develop a packaging template and apply the design to a 3D mockup.

### Step 5: Client Feedback and Revisions

The designer presents the initial concepts to the client for review. Feedback is collected to further refine the designs. For example, the client might request a brighter colour palette or adjustments to the logo’s typography.

To-do list for this step:

* Incorporate client feedback into the design.  
* Ensure the revisions align with the project goals.

### Step 6: Final Presentation and Delivery

The final step involves presenting the polished designs to the client, showcasing how the branding works across different mediums. The deliverables are handed over to the client including high-resolution files and usage guidelines.

To-do list for this step:

* Prepare a professional presentation highlighting the design’s strengths.  
* Deliver files in the required formats (e.g. AI, PDF, PNG).
