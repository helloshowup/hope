## ANALYSE DESIGNS  

### BILLBOARD/TUBE ADVERTISEMENT  
![Transport for London awareness billboard: an orange background fills the frame while two hands form a heart-shape. A blue rectangular banner inside the heart reads “BE CONSIDERATE TO OTHERS” in large white capitals, followed by the smaller line “Please remember, not all disability is visible.” The Transport for London roundel logo and the words “Mayor of London” sit in the lower-right corner.]()  

Take some time (5 minutes) to observe this Transport for London awareness billboard. Look specifically at the use of space within the composition and the hierarchy therein. Assess the use of leading lines and colours before then analysing the effectiveness of application and overall design aesthetic.

### RULE OF THIRDS  
![Schematic of the billboard overlaid with a 3 × 3 rule-of-thirds grid. Four red grid intersections are numbered: ① top-left (headline), ② bottom-centre (sub-copy), ③ top-right (secondary copy), ④ bottom-right (logo). Grey blocks mark content areas; the logo and “Mayor of London” copy sit outside the primary focal intersections.]()  

The rule of thirds has been applied to the elements within the composition. Take note of the placement of the tertiary information (logo and “Mayor of London” copy) being outside of the main focal points within the rule.

### HIERARCHY  
![Block diagram illustrating hierarchy: a large grey rectangle labelled 1 at upper left, a medium rectangle labelled 2 at mid-right, and two small rectangles labelled 3 and 4 along the bottom. The descending sizes show primary, secondary and tertiary emphasis.]()  

Hierarchy of information is portrayed with larger copy elements sitting at the first focal point (1); the secondary information (2) is smaller and sits at the fourth focal point; and the tertiary elements are smallest (3 and 4).

### LEADING LINES  

![First leading-line diagram: a red arrow traces the curved gap between two illustrated fingers from the left edge toward a mid-right grey rectangle, guiding the viewer’s gaze to secondary information.]()  

Leading lines can help direct a viewer’s gaze through the information in conjunction with the use of the rule of thirds and hierarchical techniques. The first leading line comes from the gap in the fingers, almost pointing to the secondary information.  

![Second leading-line diagram: two red arrows follow an S-shaped gap between the fingers, both arrows converging toward the lower-right corner where a small grey rectangle (Transport for London logo) is placed.]()  

The second leading line is also created by the gap in the fingers and is amplified by the thumbnail pointing towards the bottom-right corner and the Transport for London logo.

### COLOUR AND CONTRAST  

![Colour-contrast swatch: a wide orange rectangle fills the frame except for a horizontal turquoise-blue band occupying the lower third, demonstrating complementary contrast of orange and blue.]()  

Contrast in the composition has been applied by utilising three simple colours. Blue and orange are complementary contrasting colours.  

![Contrast-legibility diagram: solid orange rectangle with a central white text block and several smaller white bars lower right and lower left, highlighting legibility of white type on orange while secondary to the blue-orange contrast.]()  

The contrast of white copy over a darker orange background could be improved but is high enough to be easily read whilst being secondary to the complementary contrast between the blue and orange.
