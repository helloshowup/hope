# 5.5 Impact Reflection Submission

# Impact Reflection Submission

## Instructions for Completing Your Impact Reflection

This assignment brings together everything you've learned about community service and empathy development. As you prepare your reflection, consider how your service experience has shaped your understanding of community needs and your role as an engaged citizen. The dual format of audio and written reflection allows you to express your thoughts in different ways, giving you the opportunity to articulate both the details and the essence of your experience.

### What to Submit

1. **Audio Recording**: Create a 2-3 minute audio recording discussing:
   - The specific community need you addressed
   - How your service made a difference
   - A moment when you experienced or witnessed empathy during your service
   - How this experience changed your perspective

2. **Written Reflection**: Compose a concise 100-word reflection that captures the essence of your service experience. Focus on:
   - The most meaningful aspect of your service
   - How this experience developed your sense of empathy
   - One way this experience might influence your future actions

### Submission Guidelines

1. Upload your audio file (MP3 or WAV format)
2. Type your 100-word reflection in the text box below
3. Click "Submit" when both components are complete

### Success Tips
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your audio reflection
- For your written reflection, try writing a longer draft first, then edit down to 100 words
- Review the rubric in the Resources section to ensure you've met all requirements

**Important Note**: This submission serves as a mastery gate in your course. Your instructor will review your reflection to ensure you've demonstrated understanding of community impact and empathy before you can proceed to the next concept. You'll receive notification when your submission is approved and the next section is unlocked.
