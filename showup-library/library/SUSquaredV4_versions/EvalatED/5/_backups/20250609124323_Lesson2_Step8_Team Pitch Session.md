## Presentation Tips
Effective presentations balance content with delivery style. Remember that how you present can be just as important as what you present. Maintain eye contact with your audience, speak clearly and at an appropriate pace, and use confident body language to convey your enthusiasm for the opportunity. Consider recording a practice session to identify areas where delivery could be improved. Additionally, prepare for technical difficulties by having backup plans for visual aids and ensuring all team members can cover for each other if needed.
