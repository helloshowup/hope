# 5.15 Plan Approval

## Introduction
Before implementing your balance plan, you need your instructor to validate its feasibility. This important checkpoint ensures your plan is realistic, achievable, and aligned with sound financial principles. Think of this approval process as having an experienced financial advisor check your strategy before you begin - it helps prevent mistakes and sets you up for success.

## Why Instructor Validation Matters
Your instructor brings valuable expertise to your balance plan. They can identify potential issues you might have overlooked. This validation step serves several important purposes:

**Reality Check**: Your instructor will assess whether your income projections, expense categories, and savings goals are realistic for your specific situation.

**Identification of Blind Spots**: We often miss important expense categories or underestimate costs. Your instructor will help identify these gaps.

**Verification of Mathematical Accuracy**: Calculation errors can significantly impact a balance plan. Your instructor will verify that your numbers add up correctly.

**Alignment with Financial Principles**: Your instructor will ensure your plan follows the sound financial practices taught in this course.

## The Approval Process
To obtain approval:
1. Submit your completed balance plan through the designated submission portal in your Student Portal
2. Your instructor will review your plan and provide feedback within 2-3 business days
3. You may proceed to implementation only after receiving explicit approval
4. If revisions are needed, your instructor will provide specific guidance on what to adjust

**Important Note for Working Students**: If you're balancing work and school commitments, plan ahead for this approval step in your schedule. The 2-3 day review period is an important consideration for your overall timeline.

**Remember**: This approval step isn't about judgment but about ensuring you have the strongest possible foundation for financial success. Many students find their instructor's feedback to be one of the most valuable learning opportunities in this process.
