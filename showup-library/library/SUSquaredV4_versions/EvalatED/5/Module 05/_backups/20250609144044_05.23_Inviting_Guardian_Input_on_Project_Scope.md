# 5.17 Inviting Guardian Input on Project Scope

Ever wondered how a five-minute conversation with your guardian could save you hours of project revisions later? When you invite your guardian's perspective on academic projects, you're not just checking a boxâ€”you're tapping into years of experience that can reveal blind spots in your planning. This guide walks you through requesting meaningful feedback on your project scope through Excel High School's portal, helping you capture insights that might otherwise remain undiscovered.

## Why Guardian Collaboration Matters

Guardian involvement in your educational journey creates a stronger support network and helps bridge the gap between home and school. When you invite your guardian to review your project scope, you're not only keeping them informed about your academic work but also leveraging their life experience and perspective. Their input might help you identify potential challenges, refine your focus, or even expand your thinking in new directions.

## Steps to Invite Guardian Comment

### Prepare Your Project Scope

A well-defined project scope matters when you ask for input. Think of your project scope as a roadmap showing your destination and route. When your guardian understands your vision and plan, they can give specific feedback that meets your needs.

Before asking for your guardian's input, make sure you've outlined your project well. Include your objectives, main questions, resources, and timeline. The better you explain your project, the more useful feedback you'll get.

### Access the Guardian Communication Feature

Once your project scope is ready for review, the next step is to navigate to the appropriate section of the Excel High School portal. The platform connects students and guardians, making it simple to share schoolwork and get feedback. This digital space keeps important conversations about your education documented and accessible.

- Log into your Excel High School student portal
- Navigate to "My Courses" and select your current project course
- Click on the "Guardian Collaboration" tab in the left navigation menu

### Compose a Clear Invitation Message

Good communication matters when asking for feedback. Your message sets the tone for working together and helps your guardian understand what input would help you most. Being specific about your needs focuses their attention where their perspective will most impact your project.

Write a brief but specific message to your guardian explaining:

- What the project is about
- What aspects you want feedback on
- Any specific questions you have
- When you hope to receive their input

**Example Message Template:**
```
Hi [Guardian Name],

I've started planning my [subject] project on [topic]. Could you review my project scope using the link below and share your thoughts, especially on [specific area for feedback]?

I'd appreciate your feedback by [date] so I can make adjustments before submitting my final plan.

Thank you!
```

### Follow Up and Apply Feedback

After sending your invitation, take steps to make sure your guardian sees it. When you consider their feedback, you show commitment to working together. This follow-through is part of the learning process and shows respect for the time your guardian spent supporting your schoolwork.

- Send a text message or email to let your guardian know about the portal invitation
- Read their comments when they respond
- Respond to their input through the portal with any follow-up questions
- Incorporate relevant suggestions into your project scope
- Thank your guardian for their contribution and share how their input helped

## Tips for Successful Guardian Collaboration

- Schedule a specific time to discuss the project if complex feedback is needed
- Be open to perspectives that might differ from your initial vision
- Remember that you make the final decisions about your project
- Use this as an opportunity to practice professional communication skills

Remember, this collaboration process helps improve your learning experience while building stronger communication with your support network at home.
