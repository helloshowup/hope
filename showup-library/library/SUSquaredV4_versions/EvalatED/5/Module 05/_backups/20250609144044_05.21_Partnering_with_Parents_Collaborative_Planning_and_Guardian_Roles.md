# 5.15 Partnering with Parents: Collaborative Planning and Guardian Roles

<!---edited-start-->Did you know that students with engaged parents are 40% more likely to excel in online learning environments? At Excel High School, we view parents and guardians as essential partners in education—not just bystanders. Whether you're a homeschooling parent leading daily instruction or a guardian providing after-school support, your involvement directly impacts your student's success. This lesson explores effective collaboration strategies to create an optimal learning environment through our three-way partnership.<!---edited-end-->

## The Partnership Approach to Education

Education works best when approached as a partnership between the school, the student, and the home. Each partner brings unique strengths to the relationship:

- **Excel High School** provides the curriculum, qualified teachers, academic structure, and accreditation
- **Students** bring their effort, engagement, and commitment to learning
- **Parents/Guardians** offer support, guidance, oversight, and valuable insight into their child's learning style

Research shows that students achieve better academic results when parents take part in their education. This partnership becomes even more important in an online learning environment where students may need additional structure and support at home.

## Understanding Guardian Roles in Online Education

The role you play as a parent or guardian will vary depending on your student's age, maturity level, learning style, and the educational model you've chosen. Let's explore some common roles:

### Learning Coach (Primary for Homeschool Families)

Many homeschooling families choose Excel High School because it provides a structured curriculum while allowing parents to maintain an active teaching role. As a learning coach, you might:

- Review lesson content before or alongside your student
- Facilitate discussions about course material
- Help explain difficult concepts
- Monitor progress and comprehension
- Communicate regularly with Excel teachers about any concerns

This role matters most for younger students or those new to online learning. You're partnering with Excel to deliver instruction, while we provide the curriculum structure and academic oversight.

### Educational Manager

In this role, you're less involved in direct instruction but help manage the learning environment by:

- Creating a dedicated, distraction-free study space
- Establishing and maintaining a consistent schedule
- Monitoring assignment completion and deadlines
- Reviewing grades and feedback from teachers
- Helping your student develop organizational skills

### Motivational Support

All students, regardless of age or independence level, benefit from encouragement and emotional support. In this capacity, you:

- Celebrate successes and progress
- Provide encouragement during challenging assignments
- Help your student persevere through difficulties
- Recognize and acknowledge effort, not just achievement
- Model a positive attitude toward learning

> ### Worked Example: Guardian Roles in Action
> 
> **REAL SAMPLE:** Guardian engagement plan spreadsheet that includes weekly touchpoints (Monday check-in on upcoming assignments, Wednesday progress review, Friday reflection), consent checks for academic interventions, and a clear escalation path for concerns (teacher → advisor → administration).
>
> **CONTRASTING SAMPLE:** Quick email: "Hi Mom, I need help with my schoolwork? Can you figure out what I'm supposed to do this week? Thanks!"

## Collaborative Planning for Student Success

Effective collaboration requires intentional planning and communication. Here are key strategies for partnering with Excel High School:

1. **Establish clear expectations** - Work with your student to set realistic goals and expectations for their academic performance, study habits, and time management.

2. **Maintain open communication** - Don't hesitate to reach out to Excel teachers and advisors with questions or concerns. We're here to support both you and your student.

3. **Participate in orientation** - Take advantage of parent orientation resources to familiarize yourself with Excel's systems, policies, and support services.

4. **Schedule regular check-ins** - Set aside time to review your student's progress, discuss any challenges, and adjust support strategies as needed.

5. **Utilize the Parent Portal** - Access real-time progress updates, assignment information, and communication tools through your dedicated Parent Portal.

6. **Connect with support resources** - Familiarize yourself with Excel's Success Coach Pro, tutoring center, Writing Lab, and BRYTE AI Tutor to help your student overcome challenges.

## Adapting Your Role as Students Grow

Your role will change as students develop greater independence and self-regulation skills:

- **Middle School Students (11-14)**: Often need more direct supervision and hands-on guidance
- **Traditional High School Students (14-18)**: Benefit from increasing autonomy with regular check-ins
- **Adult Learners (18+)**: May need different types of support, such as encouragement and accountability

Remember, this partnership is flexible and will evolve as your student grows in independence and academic capability. The ultimate goal is to provide the right balance of support and autonomy that helps your student thrive in their educational journey with Excel High School.
