# 5.12 Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections

Ever notice how a mirror only shows one angle of your reflection? When peers review your work, they become additional mirrors, revealing perspectives you'd never see alone. This peer feedback loop—where you share reflections and receive honest insights from classmates—creates a powerful mechanism for deeper understanding and accelerated growth. In this activity, you'll work in triads to exchange reflections and identify evidence of development in each other's work.

## The Value of Peer Feedback

Peer feedback transforms individual reflection into collaborative learning. When you review a classmate's reflection, you not only help them see blind spots in their thinking, but you also strengthen your own analytical skills. By identifying evidence of growth in others' work, you develop a keener eye for recognizing progress in your own learning journey.

The process of giving and receiving feedback builds critical communication skills that extend far beyond Excel High School. In professional settings, the ability to provide constructive, evidence-based feedback is highly prized, as is the capacity to receive feedback with openness and apply it effectively.

## Activity Instructions

### How the Triad Exchange Works

In your assigned triad group, you'll exchange your written reflections with two peers. Each member will:

1. **Read carefully** (10-15 minutes): Review both peers' reflections in depth, noting specific examples of growth, insight, or learning.

2. **Tag evidence** (10 minutes): Identify and highlight at least three specific statements or passages that demonstrate growth. Use the comment feature in the Excel Student Portal to explain why these represent development.

3. **Ask questions** (5-10 minutes): Pose at least two thoughtful questions that might help your peer extend their thinking or consider new perspectives.

4. **Provide constructive feedback** (10 minutes): Offer specific suggestions for how the reflection could be strengthened, focusing on content rather than mechanics.

5. **Acknowledge strengths** (5 minutes): Highlight what was particularly effective or insightful about the reflection.

### Tips for Success

- **Be specific**: Instead of "good job," try "Your analysis of how you approached the problem in new ways shows significant growth in your critical thinking."
- **Focus on growth**: Look for evidence of learning, not just completion of tasks.
- **Ask open-ended questions**: "Have you considered how this approach might apply to...?" rather than yes/no questions.
- **When receiving feedback**: Listen with an open mind and resist the urge to defend or explain. The goal is to gain new insights from how others perceive your work.

### Example Feedback

"In paragraph 2, you mentioned how you initially struggled with the concept but then created your own examples to understand it better. This shows growth in your self-directed learning strategies. Have you thought about applying this same approach to other challenging concepts?"

## Key Takeaways
- Peer feedback transforms individual reflection into collaborative learning by providing new perspectives, helping identify blind spots, and strengthening analytical skills for both the giver and receiver.
- The structured triad exchange process develops critical communication skills through reading, tagging evidence, asking questions, providing constructive feedback, and acknowledging strengths.
- Effective peer feedback focuses on specific examples of growth rather than general comments, uses open-ended questions to extend thinking, and requires openness to receiving new insights without defensiveness.
