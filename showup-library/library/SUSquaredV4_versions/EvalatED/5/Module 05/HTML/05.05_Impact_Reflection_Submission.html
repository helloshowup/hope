<h2>Instructions for Completing Your Impact Reflection</h2>
<p>This assignment brings together everything you've learned about community service and empathy development. As you prepare your reflection, consider how your service experience has shaped your understanding of community needs and your role as an engaged citizen. The dual format of audio and written reflection allows you to express your thoughts in different ways, giving you the opportunity to articulate both the details and the essence of your experience.</p>
<h3>What to Submit</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Audio Recording</strong>: Create a 1-2 minute audio recording discussing:
   - The community need you addressed
   - How your service helped
   - A simple example of empathy you observed or experienced
   - One thing you learned from this experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Written Reflection</strong>: Compose a brief 75-100 word reflection that captures your service experience. Focus on:
   - What you found meaningful about your service
   - How this experience helped you understand empathy
   - Something you might do differently in the future</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
<li>Upload your audio file (MP3 or WAV format)</li>
<li>Type your 100-word reflection in the text box below</li>
<li>Click "Submit" when both components are complete</li>
</ol>
<h3>Success Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>For your audio recording, simply describe what happened, what you did, and what resulted</li>
<li>For your written reflection, focus on being clear and concise</li>
<li>Review the basic requirements listed above to make sure you've included all the necessary elements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: This submission serves as a key checkpoint in your course. Your instructor will review your reflection to verify you've demonstrated understanding of community impact and empathy before you can proceed to the next concept. You'll receive notification when your submission is approved and the next section is unlocked.</p>
