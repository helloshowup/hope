Maintain eye contact with your audience, speak with confidence and at a good pace, and use strong body language to show your enthusiasm for the opportunity. Try recording a practice session to spot areas for improvement. Also, prepare for technical issues by having backup plans for visual aids and making sure all team members can cover for each other if needed.</p>
