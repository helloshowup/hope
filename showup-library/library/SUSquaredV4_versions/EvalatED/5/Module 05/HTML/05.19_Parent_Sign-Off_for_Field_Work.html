<p>Did you know that 87% of employers value real-world experience alongside academic credentials? At Excel High School, service fieldwork bridges classroom learning with practical applicationâ€”but it requires guardian approval first. Our streamlined digital signature process ensures parents receive complete information about activities, potential risks, and educational benefits, protecting both students and the school while maintaining transparent family communication.</p>
<h2>What is the Parent Sign-Off?</h2>
<p>The Parent Sign-Off is a digital signature that legally documents a parent or guardian's approval for their student to participate in service fieldwork. This electronic form includes details about the specific fieldwork activity, location, duration, supervision, and any special requirements or considerations. By providing their digital signature, parents acknowledge they have reviewed this information and consent to their student's participation.</p>
<h2>Why is a Digital Signature Required?</h2>
<p>A digital signature is required for several important reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Protection</strong>: The signature serves as documentation that proper consent was obtained before a minor participated in off-campus activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety Assurance</strong>: It confirms that parents are aware of where their student will be and what activities they'll be performing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Tool</strong>: The process ensures parents receive complete information about educational activities occurring outside the traditional classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability Management</strong>: It helps Excel High School manage risk by ensuring all participants have proper authorization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The digital signature process represents Excel High School's commitment to both educational excellence and student safety. While fieldwork provides valuable real-world learning experiences that extend beyond traditional classroom settings, proper documentation ensures these activities meet all necessary standards and requirements. The straightforward process outlined below allows parents to provide prompt authorization while maintaining proper oversight of their student's educational activities.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access the Form</strong>: Log in to your Parent Portal and select "Field Work Permissions" from the dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Review Details</strong>: Take time to read all information about the specific fieldwork activity.</li>
<li><strong>Complete All Fields</strong>: Fill in all required information, including emergency contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Submit Signature</strong>: Type your full legal name and click "I Agree" to provide your digital signature.</li>
<li><strong>Confirmation</strong>: You'll receive an email confirmation once your submission is processed.</li>
</ol>
