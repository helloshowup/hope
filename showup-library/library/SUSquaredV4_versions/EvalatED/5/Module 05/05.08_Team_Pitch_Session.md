## Preparing Your Team Pitch

Before your presentation, make sure your team has assigned specific roles to each member:

### Team Organization

1. **Team Leader**: Introduces the opportunity and provides overview
2. **Market Analyst**: Presents research on target audience and market need
3. **Financial Strategist**: Explains resource requirements and potential returns
4. **Operations Specialist**: Outlines how the opportunity will be implemented
5. **Q&A Coordinator**: Manages questions from the audience after the presentation

Each role should be assigned based on team members' strengths, giving everyone leadership responsibility in their area of expertise.

### Pitch Structure

Your team pitch should include:

1. **Introduction** (1-2 minutes)
   - Clear value proposition: What problem does it solve?
   - Introduction of team members and their roles

2. **Opportunity Analysis** (3-4 minutes)
   - Market research and identified need
   - Target audience
   - Competitive advantage

3. **Implementation Plan** (2-3 minutes)
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline for implementation
   - Potential challenges and solutions

4. **Conclusion** (1 minute)

   - Call to action
   - Thank you and invitation for questions

5. **Q&A Session** (2-3 minutes)

## Presentation Tips

- **Practice thoroughly**: Rehearse your presentation multiple times as a team
- **Create visual aids**: Use slides or other visuals to enhance understanding
- **Time management**: Assign a timekeeper to help you stay within limits

Effective presentations balance content with delivery style. Remember that how you present can be just as important as what you present. Maintain eye contact with your audience, speak with confidence and at a good pace, and use strong body language to show your enthusiasm for the opportunity. Try recording a practice session to spot areas for improvement. Also, prepare for technical issues by having backup plans for visual aids and making sure all team members can cover for each other if needed.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your team pitch will be evaluated on:

- Clarity and persuasiveness of presentation
- Evidence of thorough research and analysis
- Professional handling of questions
- Creativity and innovation

The evaluation process aims to provide constructive feedback that supports your development as entrepreneurs and presenters. Each criterion is weighted to reflect both the quality of your business concept and the effectiveness of your team's collaboration. Peer evaluations will complement instructor assessment, offering multiple perspectives on your work. This thorough review gives you valuable insights about both the content of your pitch and your presentation skills, which will help in your future professional endeavors.
