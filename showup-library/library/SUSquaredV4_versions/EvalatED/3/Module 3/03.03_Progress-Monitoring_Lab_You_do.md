Welcome to the Progress-Monitoring Lab! In this hands-on activity, you'll work directly with a progress-monitoring dashboard designed to help you track and optimize your learning journey at Excel High School. Managing your time and monitoring your progress are essential skills for academic success regardless of your learning path. This lab will give you practical experience using tools that provide immediate feedback on your study habits and help you make data-informed decisions about your learning approach. By the end of this session, you'll have set up personalized goals, tracked actual study sessions, and interpreted feedback to improve your learning efficiency.

## Setting Up Your Weekly Goal

### Step 1: Access the Progress Dashboard

1. Log in to your Excel High School student portal
2. Navigate to the "Learning Tools" section
3. Select "Progress Monitoring Dashboard"
4. Click on "New Weekly Goal"

### Step 2: Create a SMART Goal

Your first task is to create a specific, measurable goal for this week's studying. The dashboard will help you structure this properly.

<br/>
1. Select the subject you want to focus on from the dropdown menu
2. In the "Weekly Goal" field, enter a specific target using the SMART framework:

- **Specific**: Clearly state what you want to accomplish
- **Measurable**: Include numbers or percentages
- **Achievable**: Be realistic about what you can do in one week
- **Relevant**: Connect to your current learning needs
- **Time-bound**: Set deadlines within the week

**Examples of well-structured goals:**

- **For credit recovery students:** "Complete 3 math lessons with at least 80% accuracy by Friday at 5 PM."
- **For traditional students:** "Read and annotate 2 chapters of my history textbook and create 15 flashcards by Thursday evening."
- **For adult learners:** "Complete 1 science lab report and review feedback from my previous assignment by Wednesday at 9 PM."
- **For international students:** "Practice 20 minutes of English vocabulary daily and complete one writing assignment by Sunday."

**Try it yourself:** Write your own SMART goal for a subject you're currently working on in the text box provided.

### Step 3: Set Study Parameters

The system needs information about your study habits to provide meaningful feedback:

<br/>
1. Select your preferred study environment(s) from the options provided
2. Indicate your best time of day for focused work (morning, afternoon, evening)
3. Choose your preferred study duration (15-90 minutes)
4. Select any tools or resources you plan to use

<br/>
Click "Save Weekly Goal" when complete. The dashboard will display your goal with a visual progress tracker.

## Logging Study Sessions

Now that you've established your goal, you'll need to log at least two actual study sessions to generate meaningful feedback.

### Step 1: Start Your First Study Session

1. When you're ready to begin studying, return to the dashboard
2. Click "Start New Study Session"
3. The timer will begin tracking your study duration
4. Work on your subject material as planned

### Step 2: Complete Session Details

After finishing your study session:

<br/>
1. Click "End Session"
2. Rate your focus level during the session (1-10)
3. Select which specific topics you covered
4. Note any challenges you encountered using the dropdown menu and comment box
5. Record what you accomplished (problems completed, pages read, etc.)
6. Upload any evidence of work (optional)

**Checkpoint:** Did you remember to click "Save Session" after entering all details?

### Step 3: Log a Second Session

Follow the same process to log a second study session. Try to space this session at least a few hours apart from the first one to get more meaningful feedback.

<br/>
1. Return to the dashboard when ready for another session
2. Click "Start New Study Session"
3. Complete your studying
4. End the session and fill in the details

<br/>
The system requires at least two data points to generate personalized feedback on your study patterns.

## Interpreting Your Feedback

After logging two or more study sessions, the dashboard will generate personalized feedback to help you optimize your learning approach.

### Step 1: Access Your Feedback Report

1. From the dashboard, click "View Progress Report"
2. Review the visual representation of your study sessions
3. Note the observations and recommendations

### Step 2: Analyze Key Metrics

The dashboard will highlight several important metrics:

<br/>
1. **Productivity Score**: How effective your study time was based on your self-reported focus and accomplishments
2. **Optimal Study Time**: When you seem most focused based on your session data
3. **Pacing Analysis**: Whether you're on track to meet your weekly goal
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Any habits or approaches that seem to be helping or hindering your progress

**Reflection Question:** Which metric surprised you the most and why? Type your answer in the reflection box.

### Step 3: Apply Recommendations

The final step is to apply what you've learned:

<br/>
1. Review the specific suggestions for improving your study approach
2. Select at least one recommendation to implement in your next study session
3. Update your weekly goal if necessary based on the feedback
4. Schedule your next study session at the recommended optimal time
