# 3.11 Student-Led Ethics Newsletter (Spiral 1)



# Overview

Creating a student-led ethics newsletter provides an opportunity to explore ethical issues in technology while developing research, writing, and collaboration skills. This project allows students to investigate topics of interest, synthesize information from multiple sources, and communicate complex ideas to peers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Develop a structured ethics newsletter that examines at least two technological ethical issues using credible sources
- Collaborate with peers to create and publish newsletter content that demonstrates multiple perspectives on ethical topics
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your newsletter based on specific audience feedback and self-reflection criteria

## Project Structure

The ethics newsletter project follows a structured process:

<br/>
1. **Planning and Organization**: Form editorial teams, establish roles, and determine the newsletter's focus
2. **Research and Development**: Investigate chosen topics, gather information, and outline articles
3. **Content Creation**: Write and edit articles, create visual elements, and design layout
4. **Publication and Distribution**: Finalize the newsletter and share with the intended audience
5. **Reflection and Evaluation**: Assess the project's success and identify areas for improvement

## Getting Started

To begin the ethics newsletter project, students should first explore examples of effective newsletters and discuss what makes them engaging and informative. The following sections will guide students through each phase of the newsletter creation process, providing templates, resources, and checkpoints along the way.
