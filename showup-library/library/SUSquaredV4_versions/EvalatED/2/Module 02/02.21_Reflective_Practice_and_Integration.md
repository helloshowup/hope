I recently had to give a presentation to my classmates about climate change. During this interaction, I used active listening techniques that I learned in our unit on effective communication. This strategy worked well when addressing questions from my peers, but I faced challenges when trying to manage conflicting viewpoints during the discussion period.

The presentation itself went smoothly until the Q&A session began. Several students expressed strong opinions about climate policy solutions, with some advocating for immediate government regulation while others argued for market-based approaches. As the discussion intensified, maintaining a productive conversation became difficult. Despite having researched the topic thoroughly, navigating these opposing viewpoints required communication skills beyond just content knowledge. The experience highlighted how emotional certain topics can become, even in an academic setting, and demonstrated the importance of establishing ground rules for respectful dialogue before opening the floor for discussion.

After reflection, I see I could have improved my approach by using more inclusive language and acknowledging different perspectives because this would have created a more collaborative atmosphere. This experience taught me that effective communication requires both preparation and adaptability, which will change how I structure group discussions in the future.
