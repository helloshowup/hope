# 2.24 Tips Application Exercise

## Introduction
Now that you've extracted valuable communication tips from the BC_STORY framework, it's time to put them into practice. The true test of understanding comes through application. In this exercise, you'll select one of the communication tips you've identified and apply it in a real-world outreach situation. This practical application will help solidify your understanding of effective communication principles and provide tangible evidence of their impact.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Apply communication principles in a real-world context
- Analyze the effectiveness of specific communication strategies
- Develop critical reflection skills about your own communication practices

## Applying Your Selected Tip

### Step 1: Choose Your Tip
Review the communication tips you extracted from the BC_STORY framework. Select one that you believe would be particularly effective in a real-world communication scenario. Choose a tip that addresses an area where you'd like to improve or that seems especially relevant to your current communication needs.

### Step 2: Plan Your Outreach
Identify a specific person or group you need to communicate with. This could be:
- A professional contact (colleague, supervisor, potential employer)
- A community organization
- A friend or family member with whom you need to discuss something important
- A customer service representative
- A classmate for a group project

Plan how you'll incorporate your chosen tip into this communication. Consider:
- What medium will you use? (email, phone call, in-person conversation, text message)
- What is your specific goal for this communication?
- How will you implement the selected tip?

### Step 3: Execute Your Communication
Carry out your planned outreach, consciously applying the selected tip. Pay attention to:
- How it feels to intentionally apply this communication principle
- Any adjustments you make during the interaction
- The recipient's response
- Whether the communication achieves your intended goal

### Step 4: Document Your Experience
After completing your outreach, document your experience in a brief reflection (approximately 250-300 words) that includes:

1. The specific tip you selected and why you chose it
2. A description of the communication scenario (who, what, when, how)
3. How you applied the tip in your outreach
4. The results of your communication
5. Your observations about the effectiveness of the tip
6. What you might do differently next time

#### Reflection Template
To help organize your thoughts, you can use this template:

```
Tip Applied: [Write your selected tip here]

Communication Scenario: [Describe who you communicated with and the situation]

Application: [Explain how you specifically applied the tip]

Results: [Describe what happened and how the recipient(s) responded]

Observations: [Analyze the effectiveness of the tip based on this experience]

Future Improvements: [Suggest how you might refine your approach next time]
```

### Example Documentation
Here's an example of what your documentation might look like:

> **Tip Applied**: "Begin with context before diving into details"
> 
> **Communication Scenario**: I needed to email my team about a project deadline change.
> 
> **Application**: Instead of starting with "The deadline has changed to Friday," I began with context: "Our client has requested additional features for the project, which affects our timeline. To accommodate these changes while maintaining quality..."
> 
> **Results**: All team members acknowledged the email within two hours (faster than usual). No one expressed frustration about the change, and two team members proactively offered solutions.
> 
> **Observations**: Providing context first seemed to help team members understand the reasoning behind the change before reacting to it. This appeared to reduce potential negative reactions and fostered a problem-solving mindset.
> 
> **Future Improvements**: Next time, I would include even more specific context about which client requests led to the change, as one team member asked for clarification on this point.

## Submission Guidelines
Your documented experience should be:
- 250-300 words in length
