# 2.20 Submit Barrier Analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Use a quality assurance checklist to check your barrier analysis for completeness
- Prepare a finalized barrier analysis document that meets all submission requirements
- Reflect on the barrier analysis process and its real-world applications

## Introduction
Submitting a comprehensive barrier analysis represents the culmination of your investigative work into behavioral change obstacles. This critical document synthesizes your findings about what prevents target populations from adopting desired behaviors and outlines strategic interventions to address these challenges. A well-crafted barrier analysis serves as both an analytical tool and a roadmap for implementation, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. As you prepare to finalize your submission, this module will guide you through quality assurance steps and submission requirements to ensure your analysis meets professional standards.

## Core Concept 1: Finalizing Your Barrier Analysis
Your barrier analysis should now contain all essential components, including:

1. **Identified Behavior**: A clear description of the specific behavior you're analyzing and the target population.
2. **Barrier Identification**: Comprehensive documentation of all barriers (physical, social, knowledge-based, etc.) that prevent adoption of the behavior.
3. **Determinant Analysis**: Classification of barriers according to behavioral determinants (access, perceived risk, self-efficacy, social norms, etc.).
4. **Evidence Base**: Supporting data from interviews, surveys, observations, or literature that validates your identified barriers.
5. **Prioritization Framework**: A systematic approach to ranking barriers based on importance, changeability, and impact.
6. **Intervention Strategies**: Proposed solutions that address your top-priority barriers.

**Checkpoint**: Take time to review each section. Are all components complete and connected with solid evidence?

**Checkpoint**: Before proceeding with submission, conduct a thorough review of your barrier analysis document. Many students find it helpful to step away from their work for 24-48 hours before this final review. This creates mental distance that allows for more objective assessment. When reviewing, pay particular attention to the logical connections between identified barriers and proposed interventions. Ask yourself whether an outside reader would be able to follow your reasoning from problem identification through to solution development. Consider having a classmate or colleague review your work as well—fresh eyes often catch inconsistencies or gaps that may have been overlooked.

| Quality Standard | Key Question |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Comprehensiveness** | Have you identified barriers across multiple categories (physical, social, psychological, etc.)? |
| **Evidence-Based** | Is each barrier supported by specific data points or observations? |
| **Logical Flow** | Does your analysis progress from barrier identification to intervention strategies? |
| **Specificity** | Are your proposed interventions specific, actionable, and connected to identified barriers? |
| **Cultural Sensitivity** | Does your analysis consider cultural contexts and demonstrate respect for the target population? |
| **Feasibility** | Are your proposed interventions realistic given available resources? |
| **Measurability** | Have you included ways to track the results of your proposed interventions? |

**Pro Tip**: Use this checklist as a final review tool to identify any gaps or weaknesses in your analysis before submission.

## Core Concept 3: Submission Requirements
**Pro Tip**: Successful barrier analysis submissions typically demonstrate both analytical rigor and practical applicability. When preparing your final document, focus on creating a professional presentation that showcases your methodical approach. Many organizations and academic institutions have specific formatting expectations—pay close attention to these requirements as they often reflect industry standards. The most effective submissions maintain a balance between comprehensive detail and concise communication. Remember that your document may inform actual implementation decisions, so clarity and precision are essential. Consider including visual elements such as diagrams or charts where appropriate to enhance understanding of complex relationships between barriers and interventions.

1. Follow the required format (typically a structured document with labeled sections)
2. Include all supporting materials (interview transcripts, survey data, etc.) as appendices
3. Cite all external sources using proper citation format
4. Be free of grammatical errors and typos
5. Use clear, professional language appropriate for an academic or professional audience
6. Stay within the specified word or page count (if applicable)
7. Be submitted through the designated submission portal by the deadline

Remember that your barrier analysis demonstrates not just your understanding of concepts but your ability to apply them to real-world behavioral challenges.

## Reflection Questions
Take some time to consider these questions before submitting your work:

1. What was the most challenging aspect of conducting your barrier analysis, and how did you overcome this challenge? This reflection helps identify personal growth areas and problem-solving strategies that can be applied to future projects. Consider both methodological challenges (such as data collection difficulties) and analytical challenges (such as determining which barriers are most significant). Documenting these challenges and solutions demonstrates critical thinking and adaptability—valuable skills in any professional context.

2. How might the findings from your barrier analysis be applied in other contexts or with different target populations?
3. If you had additional time and resources, what would you add or change about your barrier analysis to make it more comprehensive or effective?

## Check Your Understanding
1. What should be the relationship between identified barriers and proposed interventions?
   - A. Each intervention should address one or more specific barriers
   - B. Interventions should focus on the easiest barriers to overcome
   - C. Barriers and interventions can be developed separately
   - D. Only physical barriers require specific interventions

2. Which of the following is NOT typically included in a barrier analysis submission?
   - A. Evidence supporting identified barriers
   - B. A complete implementation budget
   - C. Prioritization of barriers based on importance
   - D. Proposed intervention strategies

3. What is the primary purpose of submitting a barrier analysis?
   - A. To demonstrate theoretical knowledge of behavior change models
   - B. To verify mastery of barrier analysis methodology and application skills
   - C. To secure funding for implementation
   - D. To publish research findings

## Summary
Congratulations on completing your barrier analysis! This project represents the culmination of your work in understanding and applying this critical methodology. 

A well-executed barrier analysis:
- Identifies obstacles to behavior change
- Prioritizes them based on impact and changeability
- Develops targeted interventions to overcome them

By reviewing your work against quality standards and submission requirements, you ensure that your analysis demonstrates your mastery of this important skill. Your completed barrier analysis will serve as evidence of your ability to systematically approach behavior change challenges in various contexts.

**Next Steps**: Submit your completed barrier analysis through the designated portal by the deadline. If you have any questions or need clarification, reach out to your instructor through the Success Coach Pro system.
