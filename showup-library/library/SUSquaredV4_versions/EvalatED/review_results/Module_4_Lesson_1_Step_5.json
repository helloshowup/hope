  "reviewed_content": "# Impact Reflection Submission\n\n## Instructions for Submission\n\nTo complete this section of your community service project, you need to:\n\n1. **Record an audio reflection** (1-2 minutes) discussing how your service experience impacted both the community and your personal growth.\n\n2. **Write a 100-word written reflection** that summarizes:\n   - The specific impact your service had on others\n   - How this experience developed your sense of empathy\n   - What you learned about community needs\n\n3. **Upload both files** using the submission form below.\n\nYour reflection will be reviewed by your instructor within 48 hours. Once approved, you'll automatically gain access to the next concept in this module.\n\n### Reflection Tips\n- Focus on specific examples rather than generalizations\n- Consider both immediate and potential long-term impacts\n- Relate your experience to your personal values or future goals\n- Be honest about challenges you encountered\n\nThis checkpoint ensures you've meaningfully processed your community service experience before continuing with the curriculum.\n\n**Note:** Focus on authentic reflection rather than length or production quality. If you need accommodations for the audio portion, please contact your Success Coach.\n\n### Need Help?\nIf you have questions or need technical assistance with your submission, contact the Excel High School Support Team through your Student Portal or at support@excelhighschool.com.",
