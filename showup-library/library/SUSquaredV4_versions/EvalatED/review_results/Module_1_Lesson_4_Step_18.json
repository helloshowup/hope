  "reviewed_content": "# Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections\n\n## Introduction\nIn your learning journey at Excel High School, self-reflection is only the first step toward growth. When you share your reflections with peers and receive thoughtful feedback, you gain new perspectives and insights that might otherwise remain hidden. This peer feedback loop creates a powerful mechanism for deepening understanding and accelerating personal development. In this activity, you'll work in triads to exchange reflections and identify evidence of growth in each other's work.\n\n## The Value of Peer Feedback\nPeer feedback transforms individual reflection into collaborative learning. When you review a classmate's reflection, you not only help them see blind spots in their thinking, but you also strengthen your own analytical skills. By identifying evidence of growth in others' work, you develop a keener eye for recognizing progress in your own learning journey.\n\nThe process of giving and receiving feedback builds critical communication skills that extend far beyond Excel High School. In professional settings, the ability to provide constructive, evidence-based feedback is highly valued, as is the capacity to receive feedback with openness and apply it meaningfully.\n\n## Activity Instructions\n**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes\n**Tools Needed:** Access to your triad group in the Excel Student Portal\n\n### How the Triad Exchange Works\nIn your assigned triad group, you'll exchange your written reflections with two peers. Each member will:\n\n1. **Read carefully** (10-15 minutes): Review both peers' reflections thoroughly, noting specific examples of growth, insight, or learning.\n\n2. **Tag evidence** (10 minutes): Identify and highlight at least three specific statements or passages that demonstrate growth. Use the comment feature in the Excel Student Portal to explain why these represent development.\n\n3. **Ask questions** (5-10 minutes): Pose at least two thoughtful questions that might help your peer extend their thinking or consider new perspectives.\n\n4. **Provide constructive feedback** (10 minutes): Offer specific suggestions for how the reflection could be strengthened, focusing on content rather than mechanics.\n\n5. **Acknowledge strengths** (5 minutes): Highlight what was particularly effective or insightful about the reflection.\n\n### Tips for Success\n* **Be specific**: Instead of \"good job,\" try \"Your analysis of how you approached the problem differently shows significant growth in your critical thinking.\"\n* **Focus on growth**: Look for evidence of learning, not just completion of tasks.\n* **Ask open-ended questions**: \"Have you considered how this approach might apply to...?\" rather than yes/no questions.\n* **When receiving feedback**: Listen openly and resist the urge to defend or explain. The goal is to gain new insights from how others perceive your work.\n\n### Example Feedback\n\"In paragraph 2, you mentioned how you initially struggled with the concept but then created your own examples to understand it better. This shows growth in your self-directed learning strategies. Have you thought about applying this same approach to other challenging concepts?\"\n\n## Next Steps\nAfter completing the triad exchange, take 10 minutes to reflect on the feedback you received. Identify at least one insight you gained and one action you'll take based on your peers' input. This reflection will be submitted as part of your final assessment.\n\nNeed help?
