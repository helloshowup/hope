This important checkpoint helps you avoid potential pitfalls and ensures your plan has a strong foundation.\n\nYour instructor will evaluate several key aspects of your plan:\n- The realism of your goals\n- The appropriateness of your selected activities\n- The sustainability of your proposed schedule\n- The alignment with healthy balance principles\n\nOnce approved, you'll receive feedback and permission to proceed with implementation. If revisions are needed, your instructor will provide specific guidance on how to strengthen your plan.\n\n## What to Expect\n\n**Approval Timeline:** Your instructor will review your plan within 48 hours of submission. You'll receive a notification in your Student Portal when feedback is available.\n\n**If Approved:** You'll see a green \"Approved\" badge on your submission and can begin implementing your plan immediately.\n\n**If Revisions Needed:** Your instructor will highlight specific areas for improvement with actionable suggestions. You can resubmit your revised plan once you've addressed the feedback.\n\n## Success Tips\n\n* **Be Specific:** Clearly define your activities, timeframes, and goals\n* **Be Realistic:** Consider your current commitments and start with manageable changes\n* **Show Reflection:** Demonstrate that you've thought about potential challenges and how you'll address them\n\nThis validation step is designed to set you up for success as you work toward creating better balance in your life. Remember, your Success Coach is available if you need additional support while preparing your plan.",
  "edit_summary": "I enhanced the content by:\n\n1. Adding a \"What to Expect\" section that provides specific information about the approval process timeline and possible outcomes, addressing the need for clear structure that Traditional Achievers and Credit Recovery Students require.\n\n2. Including a \"Success Tips\" section with actionable guidance to help students create stronger plans from the start, supporting the \"Self-Direction Aids\" instructional design driver.\n\n3. Adding a reminder about Success Coach availability, reinforcing the support systems available to students (especially beneficial for \"Second-Chance\" Learners who need additional encouragement).\n\n4. Maintaining the original content's clarity while expanding it to provide more specific guidance and expectations, which supports the \"Flexibility WITH Structure\" design principle.\n\nThese changes enhance the educational effectiveness by providing clearer expectations, more specific guidance, and reinforcing available support systems while maintaining the original content's purpose and tone."
