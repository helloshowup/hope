  "edit_summary": "I enhanced the content by:\n\n1. Adding a \"Success Tips\" section to provide concrete strategies for completing both the audio and written reflections, addressing the needs of both traditional students and adult learners who may need additional structure.\n\n2. Expanding the Resources section to include not just the audio guide but also reflection writing tips and sample reflections, supporting the \"scaffold & spiral\" approach in the instructional design drivers.\n\n3. Adding a clear \"Need Help?\" section that references Excel High School's specific support systems (Success Coach and BRYTE AI Tutor), making the support pathway explicit.\n\n4. Maintaining the clear structure while adding more scaffolding elements that support self-directed learning, which aligns with the school's competency-based education model.\n\n5. Ensuring language remains accessible for all learner segments while providing enough structure for those who need it (particularly \"Second-Chance Learners\" and \"Credit Recovery Students\")."
