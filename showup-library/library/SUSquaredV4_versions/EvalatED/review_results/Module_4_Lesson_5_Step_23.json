  "reviewed_content": "# Co-Planning Discussion: Inviting Guardian Feedback\n\n## Introduction\nAs you embark on your project journey at Excel High School, collaboration with your guardian can provide valuable perspective and support. This guide will help you effectively invite your guardian to comment on your project scope through the Excel High School Parent Portal.\n\n## Why Guardian Input Matters\nYour guardian brings unique insights that can help strengthen your project planning. Their life experience and different viewpoint can help you identify potential challenges, refine your ideas, and consider aspects you might have overlooked. This collaboration also helps your guardian stay connected to your academic progress.\n\n## How to Invite Guardian Feedback\n1. Log into your Excel High School Student Portal\n2. Navigate to your current project workspace\n3. Select the \"Guardian Collaboration\" option from the menu\n4. Use the message template to personalize your invitation\n5. Include specific questions about areas where you'd like feedback (see examples below)\n6. Set a reasonable timeframe for their response (we recommend 2-3 days)\n\n### Sample Questions for Your Guardian\n* What aspects of this project topic might be challenging for me?\n* Do you see any real-world applications I haven't considered?\n* What resources might help me with this project?\n* Does my timeline seem realistic given our family schedule?\n\n## Making the Most of Feedback\nWhen you receive guardian feedback:\n* Thank them for their input\n* Consider each suggestion carefully\n* Incorporate helpful ideas into your project plan\n* Document how feedback influenced your planning\n\nRemember to be open to their suggestions and use their input to enhance your project planning. This collaborative approach models real-world professional skills that will benefit you beyond Excel High School.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you encounter any technical issues with the Parent Portal or guardian collaboration features, contact your Success Coach through the Support tab in your Student Portal.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational value:\n\n1. Specified \"Parent Portal\" instead of just \"Excel High School portal\" for accuracy\n2. Added specific examples of questions students can ask guardians to provide concrete guidance\n3. Included a recommended timeframe (2-3 days) to help set expectations\n4. Added a new section on \"Making the Most of Feedback\" to create a complete feedback loop\n5. Added a \"Need Help?\" section to provide support information\n6. Enhanced formatting with additional subheadings to improve scanability\n7. Added the benefit of keeping guardians connected to academic progress\n8. Provided guidance on documenting how feedback influenced planning\n\nThese changes make the content more actionable, provide clearer guidance, and better support the diverse learner segments identified in the profile, particularly homeschooling families and younger students who benefit from guardian oversight."
