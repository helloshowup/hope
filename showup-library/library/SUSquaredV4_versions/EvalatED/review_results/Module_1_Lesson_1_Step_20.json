Added structural guidance by explicitly suggesting headings for organization\n2. Included a \"Pro Tip\" to remind students to review course materials before submitting\n3. Added a specific date placeholder [DATE] for the deadline instead of the generic placeholder\n4. Created a \"Need Help?\" section highlighting Excel's support resources (BRYTE AI Tutor, Success Coach, Writing Lab)\n5. Specified that submission occurs \"through the assignment portal below\" to clarify the submission process\n6. Improved formatting in a few places for better visual organization\n7. Removed the final paragraph about contacting the instructor and replaced it with more specific support options aligned with Excel's resources\n\nThese changes maintain the strong original content while adding scaffolding elements that align with Excel's instructional design principles of \"Flexibility WITH Structure\" and \"Self-Direction Aids.\" The additions particularly support \"Second-Chance Learners\" and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who may need additional confidence-building elements."
