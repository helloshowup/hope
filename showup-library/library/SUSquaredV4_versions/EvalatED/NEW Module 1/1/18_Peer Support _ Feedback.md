# Peer Support & Feedback

# Peer Support & Feedback

## Introduction

Supporting our peers is not just about being kindâ€”it's about creating a community where everyone can thrive. When we help others develop a growth mindset and set effective goals, we strengthen our own understanding and build valuable collaboration skills. Think about a time when someone's encouragement helped you overcome a challenge. That's the power of peer support! In this lesson, we'll explore practical strategies for supporting your classmates' growth mindset and helping them create SMART goals that lead to success.

## Core Concept 1: Supporting a Growth Mindset in Peers

A growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. When supporting peers, your words and actions can either reinforce a fixed mindset ("I'm just not good at math") or nurture a growth mindset ("I'm still learning these math concepts").

Effective ways to support a peer's growth mindset include:

1. **Praise effort, not intelligence**: Say "I noticed how you kept trying different approaches to solve that problem" instead of "You're so smart."

2. **Normalize struggle**: Share your own learning challenges: "I had trouble with this concept too. Here's what helped me..."

3. **Reframe setbacks**: Help peers see mistakes as learning opportunities: "What did you learn from this attempt that you can use next time?"

4. **Ask growth-oriented questions**: "What strategies might work better?" or "What resources could help you understand this?"

**Quick Check:** Think about a recent conversation with a classmate. Did you use any of these strategies? How might you incorporate them in your next interaction?

## Core Concept 2: Helping Peers Create SMART Goals

SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. When helping peers develop their goals, you can serve as both a sounding board and accountability partner.

Guide your peers through these steps:

1. **Specific**: Help them clarify vague goals. "I want to do better in math" becomes "I want to improve my understanding of quadratic equations."

2. **Measurable**: Ask, "How will you know when you've reached this goal?" Encourage metrics like "Complete 20 practice problems with 80% accuracy."

3. **Achievable**: Discuss whether the goal is realistic given their current situation and resources. For example, "Considering your work schedule, would 30 minutes of daily practice be manageable?"

4. **Relevant**: Explore how the goal connects to their larger aspirations. "How will mastering this skill help you with your career plans?"

5. **Time-bound**: Establish a reasonable deadline and potential checkpoints. "When do you want to achieve this by? Let's set up weekly check-ins to track progress."

**Example SMART Goal Transformation:**
* Vague goal: "I want to improve my writing."
* SMART goal: "I will complete one practice essay per week for the next month, applying the feedback I receive to improve my thesis statements, as measured by my rubric scores."

## Guided Practice: Peer Feedback Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Fixed Mindset Response**
Your classmate says: "I'm terrible at writing essays. I'll never be good at it."

How would you respond to encourage a growth mindset? Write a brief response that:
- Acknowledges their frustration
- Reframes their statement to emphasize growth potential
- Offers a specific strategy they might try

**Sample Response:** "I understand how frustrating essay writing can be. Many successful writers struggled at first but improved with practice. What specific part of essay writing is most challenging for you? Maybe we could break it down into smaller steps and use the Writing Lab resources together."

**Scenario 2: Vague Goal Statement**
Your study partner says: "I want to do better in this class."

How would you help transform this into a SMART goal? Create a dialogue showing how you would ask questions to help them develop each component of a SMART goal.

**Dialogue Framework:**
* You: "That's a good starting point. What specific aspect of the class do you want to improve in?" (Specific)
* You: "How will you know if you're doing better? What grade or skill level are you aiming for?" (Measurable)
* You: "Given your current grade and schedule, does this target seem realistic?" (Achievable)
* You: "How does improving in this class connect to your longer-term goals?" (Relevant)
* You: "By when would you like to see this improvement? Let's set some milestone dates." (Time-bound)

## Project: Peer Support Action Plan

Create a "Peer Support Action Plan" that includes:

1. **Growth Mindset Support Strategies**: Develop three specific phrases or questions you can use to support peers who are struggling with challenging material.

2. **SMART Goal Template**: Design a simple template with guiding questions that could help a peer transform a general goal into a SMART goal.

3. **Feedback Guidelines**: Create a brief set of guidelines for giving constructive feedback that supports growth rather than discouraging it.

4. **Reflection Component**: Include 2-3 reflection questions about how supporting others' growth mindset and goals might benefit your own learning journey.

Share your action plan with a classmate and discuss how you might implement these strategies in your collaborative work.

**Submission Tip:** Your action plan can be submitted as a document, presentation, or even an infographic. Choose the format that best showcases your ideas and would be most helpful to you and your peers in the future.
