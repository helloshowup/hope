# Your SMART Goals Draft

# Your SMART Goals Draft

## Setting Your Personal SMART Goals

Now it's your turn to apply the SMART goal framework to your own life. Think about three areas where you'd like to make progress - these could be academic, personal, professional, health-related, or any other important aspect of your life.

For each goal, make sure it follows the SMART criteria:
- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
- **Measurable**: Include concrete criteria to track progress
- **Achievable**: Make it realistic and attainable
- **Relevant**: Ensure it matters to you and aligns with your values
- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline or timeframe

## Your Task: Write Three Personal SMART Goals

In the space below, draft three personal SMART goals. Take your time to think about what truly matters to you. Remember that effective goals are both challenging and realistic.

For each goal:
1. Write out the complete goal statement
2. Briefly explain how it meets each SMART criterion
3. Note any potential obstacles and how you might overcome them

**Example format:**
```
Goal 1: I will improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of this semester by completing all homework assignments, attending two study sessions per week, and meeting with my teacher for extra help once every two weeks.

- Specific: Focuses on math grade improvement with clear actions (homework, study sessions, teacher meetings)
- Measurable: Clear grade target (C to B) and specific frequency of activities
- Achievable: Includes realistic action steps that can fit into my schedule
- Relevant: Academic improvement is important for my future education/career goals
- Time-bound: By the end of this semester (specific date: MM/DD/YYYY)

Potential Obstacles:
- Time management challenges with other courses
- Difficulty understanding certain math concepts
- Missing study sessions due to other commitments

Solutions:
- Use my Excel High School planner to block specific study times
- Utilize BRYTE AI Tutor when I'm stuck on difficult concepts
- Schedule study sessions at consistent times and set reminders
```

Your goals should reflect your personal priorities and circumstances. Be honest with yourself about what you truly want to achieve and what steps are realistic for your situation.

After completing this exercise, you'll have three well-structured goals that can guide your actions and help you make meaningful progress in important areas of your life. Remember that you can always adjust your goals as circumstances change - the important part is having a clear direction and plan.

**Pro Tip:** Consider sharing your goals with your Success Coach or a trusted person who can help hold you accountable and provide encouragement along the way.
