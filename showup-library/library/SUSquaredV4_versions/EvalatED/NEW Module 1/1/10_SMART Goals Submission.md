# SMART Goals Submission

# SMART Goals Submission

## Submission Instructions

Now that you've revised your SMART goals based on the criteria and feedback provided, it's time to submit them for approval. This step ensures you're on the right track before proceeding with your action plan.

### How to Submit Your SMART Goals

1. Review your revised goals one final time using the SMART criteria checklist:
   - **Specific**: Is each goal clear and precise about what you want to accomplish?
   - **Measurable**: Have you included specific metrics or indicators to track progress?
   - **Achievable**: Is the goal realistic given your current resources and constraints?
   - **Relevant**: Does this goal align with your broader educational or career objectives?
   - **Time-bound**: Have you set a clear deadline or timeframe?

2. Format your submission as follows:
   ```
   Goal #1: [Your first SMART goal]
   • How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]

   Goal #2: [Your second SMART goal]
   • How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]

   Goal #3: [Your third SMART goal] (if applicable)
   • How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]
   ```

3. Submit your goals using ONE of these methods:
   - Type directly in the text box below
   - Upload a document using the attachment feature
   - Use the BRYTE AI Tutor if you need help refining your goals before submission
