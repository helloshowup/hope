    "<educational_content>\n# Your SMART Goals Draft\n\n## Setting Your Personal SMART Goals\n\nNow it's your turn to apply the SMART goal framework to your own life. Think about three areas where you'd like to make progress - these could be academic, personal, professional, health-related, or any other important aspect of your life.\n\nFor each goal, make sure it follows the SMART criteria:\n- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish\n- **Measurable**: Include concrete criteria to track progress\n- **Achievable**: Make it realistic and attainable\n- **Relevant**: Ensure it matters to you and aligns with your values\n- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline or timeframe\n\n## Your Task: Write Three Personal SMART Goals\n\nIn the space below, draft three personal SMART goals. Take your time to think about what truly matters to you. Remember that effective goals are both challenging and realistic.\n\nFor each goal:\n1. Write out the complete goal statement\n2. Briefly explain how it meets each SMART criterion\n3. Note any potential obstacles and how you might overcome them\n\n**Example format:**\n```\nGoal 1: I will improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of this semester by completing all homework assignments, attending two study sessions per week, and meeting with my teacher for extra help once every two weeks.\n- Specific: Focuses on math grade improvement\n- Measurable: Clear grade target (C to B)\n- Achievable: Includes realistic action steps\n- Relevant: Academic improvement is important for my future\n- Time-bound: By the end of this semester\n```\n\nYour goals should reflect your personal priorities and circumstances. Be honest with yourself about what you truly want to achieve and what steps are realistic for your situation.\n\nAfter completing this exercise, you'll have three well-structured goals that can guide your actions and help you make meaningful progress in important areas of your life.\n</educational_content>",
