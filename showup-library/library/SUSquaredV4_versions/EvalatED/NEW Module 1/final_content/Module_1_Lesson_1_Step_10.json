Format your submission as follows:\n   ```\n   Goal #1: [Your first SMART goal]\n   \u2022 How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]\n\n   Goal #2: [Your second SMART goal]\n   \u2022 How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]\n\n   Goal #3: [Your third SMART goal] (if applicable)\n   \u2022 How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]\n   ```\n\n3.
