This step ensures you're on the right track before proceeding with your action plan.\n\n### How to Submit Your SMART Goals\n\n1. Review your revised goals one final time using the SMART criteria checklist:\n   - **Specific**: Is each goal clear and precise about what you want to accomplish?\n   - **Measurable**: Have you included specific metrics or indicators to track progress?\n   - **Achievable**: Is the goal realistic given your current resources and constraints?\n   - **Relevant**: Does this goal align with your broader educational or career objectives?\n   - **Time-bound**: Have you set a clear deadline or timeframe?\n\n2. Format your submission as follows:\n   ```\n   Goal #1: [Your first SMART goal]\n   \u2022 How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]\n\n   Goal #2: [Your second SMART goal]\n   \u2022 How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]\n\n   Goal #3: [Your third SMART goal] (if applicable)\n   \u2022 How I addressed feedback: [1-2 sentences]\n   ```\n\n3. Submit your goals using ONE of these methods:\n   - Type directly in the text box below\n   - Upload a document using the attachment feature\n   - Use the BRYTE AI Tutor if you need help refining your goals before submission\n\n### What Happens Next\n\nAfter submission, your instructor will review your SMART goals within 48 hours to ensure they meet all criteria. You'll receive notification through your Student Portal when feedback is available.\n\nIf your goals require further revision, you'll receive specific guidance on improvements. Once approved, you'll unlock the next module where you'll develop your action plan.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Well-crafted SMART goals significantly increase your chances of success. The time you invest now will pay off throughout your Excel High School journey!\n\nClick the \"Submit\" button below when you're ready to proceed.",
