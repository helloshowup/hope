<li>If you've been postponing a subject: "I notice you haven't worked on Algebra this week. Would a 30-minute session today help you stay on track?"</li>
<li>If you're making steady progress: "You've been consistent with your study schedule this week. This weekend, you might want to focus on your upcoming Science project."</li>
