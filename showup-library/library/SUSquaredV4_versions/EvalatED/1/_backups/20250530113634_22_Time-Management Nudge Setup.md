# Time Management Nudge Setup

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Configure a personalized digital reminder system using calendar alerts with specific deadlines and study sessions
- Set up Excel High School platform notifications to manage day-to-day coursework engagement
- Implement a dual notification approach that supports both immediate needs and long-term academic goals

Effective time management is a cornerstone of academic success, especially when working to recover credits. Yet even with the best intentions, we can all lose track of deadlines or procrastinate on important assignments. The good news? Technology can help reinforce positive study habits through strategic reminders. In this lesson, we'll set up a personalized system of digital nudges that will help you stay on track with your coursework. By the end, you'll have configured practical tools that transform good intentions into consistent action, creating a foundation for successful credit recovery.

## The Science of Effective Reminders

Digital reminders serve as external memory aids that can significantly improve task completion. Research in behavioral psychology shows that well-timed prompts can increase follow-through on intentions by up to 33%. What makes reminders effective isn't just their existence but their strategic implementation.

Effective reminders share these key characteristics:

- **Specificity**: They clearly state what action needs to be taken
- **Timeliness**: They arrive at moments when you can actually take action
- **Relevance**: They connect to meaningful goals or consequences
- **Actionability**: They suggest a clear, immediate next step

In credit recovery contexts, reminders serve dual purposes. First, they help manage immediate deadlines and assignments. Second, they gradually build the habit of proactive learning - checking in on coursework without being prompted by external forces. The reminders you'll set up today create a scaffold that supports your academic habits while you develop internal motivation.

## Calendar Alert Configuration

Let's start by setting up calendar alerts that will serve as your primary time management system:

1. **Choose your primary calendar platform** (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.). Select the one you actually check regularly.

2. **Create course-specific calendars** using color coding:

- Make a separate calendar for each course you're taking
- Assign distinct colors to make visual identification easier
- Set sharing permissions if appropriate (with parents/guardians)

3. **Schedule three types of alerts**:

- **Deadline alerts**: Set these 24 hours before assignments are due
- **Progress alerts**: Weekly check-ins (e.g., Sunday evenings) to review overall course progress
- **Work session alerts**: Scheduled blocks of focused study time

4. **Configure multi-stage reminders**:

- For important deadlines: Set alerts for 1 week before, 3 days before, and 24 hours before
- For regular study sessions: Set 1 hour before and 5 minutes before alerts

**Quick Tip**: Your alerts should include specific information like "Begin Module 3 Essay" rather than vague reminders like "Study." The more specific your reminder, the more likely you'll take action!

## Excel High School Platform Notifications

While calendar alerts provide a big-picture view of your academic schedule, Excel High School platform notifications help you manage day-to-day engagement with your coursework. Let's configure these now:

1. **Excel High School Platform Notifications**:

- Navigate to your account settings
- Enable email notifications for:
- New assignments posted
- Instructor feedback
- Upcoming deadlines
- Course announcements
- Set notification frequency (daily digest recommended)

2. **Mobile Device Setup**:

- Download the Excel High School mobile app
- Enable push notifications
- Adjust notification settings to prevent overwhelm (prioritize deadline alerts)
- Pin the app to your home screen for visibility

3. **Create Custom Reminder Chains**:

- Connect your calendar to your Excel High School account
- Set up automation where possible (e.g., when an assignment is created, automatically add to calendar)
- Create a "recovery routine" reminder that triggers whenever you miss a planned study session

The most effective system combines platform reminders (which notify you of new developments) with calendar alerts (which help you plan proactively). This dual approach ensures you're both responding to immediate needs and maintaining progress toward long-term goals.

In this lesson, we've established a comprehensive digital nudge system by configuring both calendar alerts and Excel High School platform notifications. This two-pronged approach ensures you'll have timely prompts for both scheduled work sessions and unexpected course updates. 

Remember that these digital tools aren't just about avoiding missed deadlines—they're scaffolding that helps build lasting habits of academic responsibility. As you continue with your credit recovery work, these reminders will gradually help you develop internal motivation and self-regulation skills.

**Next Steps**: Take 15 minutes right now to set up at least one calendar with alerts for your most important upcoming deadlines. Even this small step will significantly improve your chances of staying on track!
