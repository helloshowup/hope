# 1.5 A Draft Your SMART Goals

## Now It's Your Turn to Create SMART Goals

Now that you understand what makes a goal "SMART," it's time to apply these principles to your own life. Creating personal SMART goals allows you to transform vague aspirations into concrete plans for achievement. This practice will help you develop valuable goal-setting skills that will serve you throughout your academic career and beyond.

In this activity, you'll create two personal SMART goals. These can relate to any area of your life - academic, personal, health-related, financial, or career-oriented. The key is to follow the SMART framework carefully for each goal.

## Guidelines for Writing Your SMART Goals

Remember, a SMART goal is:

- **Specific**: Clearly defined and focused
- **Measurable**: Includes concrete criteria for measuring progress
- **Achievable**: Realistic and attainable
- **Relevant**: Aligned with your values and long-term objectives
- **Time-bound**: Has a defined timeline with a deadline

Here's how to approach writing your two goals:

1. **Select goal areas**: Choose two different areas of your life where you'd like to make improvements
2. **Draft your goals**: Write each goal following the SMART criteria
3. **Review and refine**: Check that each element of SMART is clearly represented
4. **Consider obstacles**: Think about potential challenges and how you might overcome them

## Examples to Guide You

Before you write your own goals, here are examples of how to transform a general goal into a SMART goal:

**General goal**: "I want to improve my grades."

**SMART version**: "I will raise my math grade from a C to a B by the end of this semester by completing all homework assignments, attending two tutoring sessions per week, and creating study guides for each test."

**General goal**: "I want to save money."

**SMART version**: "I will save $600 for a new laptop by December 31st by depositing $50 from my part-time job into a savings account each week and reducing my entertainment spending by $25 weekly."
