# Submit SMART Goals

## Introduction

Now that you've learned how to create effective SMART goals, it's time to put your knowledge into practice. This checkpoint allows you to receive personalized feedback on your goal-setting skills before moving forward. By submitting your SMART goals for evaluation, you'll ensure they truly meet all the necessary criteria and set yourself up for success in the upcoming sections on motivation strategies.

## Submitting Your SMART Goals for Feedback

SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Now it's your turn to demonstrate your understanding by creating two complete SMART goals of your own. These goals should reflect personal or academic objectives that are meaningful to you.

Your submission will be evaluated based on how well each goal meets the SMART criteria:

- **Specific**: Does your goal clearly state what you want to accomplish?
- **Measurable**: Have you included concrete criteria for measuring progress?
- **Achievable**: Is your goal realistic given your resources and constraints?
- **Relevant**: Does your goal align with your broader objectives?
- **Time-bound**: Have you established a clear timeframe with a specific deadline?

## Submission Requirements

For this assignment:

1. Create two distinct SMART goals that are personally meaningful to you
2. Format each goal as a complete statement that incorporates all five SMART elements
3. Include a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) for each goal describing how it meets each SMART criterion

**Example:**

**Goal 1:** "I will improve my Spanish language skills by completing one chapter in my Spanish workbook each week and practicing conversation with a language partner for 30 minutes twice weekly, resulting in the ability to hold a 5-minute conversation entirely in Spanish by December 15th."

**Explanation:** This goal is specific (focused on Spanish language skills with defined activities), measurable (one chapter weekly, 30-minute sessions twice weekly, 5-minute conversation), achievable (reasonable time commitments), relevant (to language learning objectives), and time-bound (by December 15th).

## Why This Matters

Receiving feedback on your SMART goals helps you:

- Confirm you've correctly applied the SMART framework
- Strengthen any weak elements before proceeding
- Transform theoretical knowledge into practical skills
- Create solid goals that upcoming motivation strategies can be applied to

## How to Submit

1. Type your two SMART goals in the text submission area
2. Include your brief explanation for each goal
3. Review your submission for clarity and completeness
4. Submit for feedback

You'll receive detailed feedback based on the SMART criteria. You may be asked to revise your goals if they don't fully meet all elements of the framework.

## Next Steps

After your SMART goals are approved, you'll explore motivation strategies to help you maintain momentum and overcome obstacles. The upcoming lessons will build directly on this foundation, making this submission an important step in your learning process.

Remember: Well-crafted SMART goals are the essential first step toward meaningful achievement!
