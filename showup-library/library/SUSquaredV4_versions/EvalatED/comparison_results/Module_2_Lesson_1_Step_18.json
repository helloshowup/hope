Online networking platforms provide unprecedented opportunities to connect with peers, mentors, and industry professionals who can support your educational and career journey. This practical exercise will help you take a concrete step toward building meaningful professional relationships by reaching out with intention and authenticity. The connections you establish today could lead to mentorship, collaboration, or career opportunities tomorrow.\n\n## Making Meaningful Connections\n\nProfessional networking isn't just about collecting contacts\u2014it's about building relationships. When sending connection requests, personalization is key to standing out and demonstrating genuine interest. A thoughtful, personalized message shows respect for the recipient's time and increases the likelihood of a positive response.\n\nEffective personalized messages typically include:\n- A brief introduction of yourself\n- How you discovered their profile\n- Why you're interested in connecting\n- A specific reference to their work, background, or shared interests\n- A clear, professional tone\n\nFor example, rather than using the platform's default message, you might write:\n\n> \"Hello Ms. Johnson, I'm a student at Excel High School with an interest in digital marketing. I was impressed by your presentation at the Virtual Career Fair last month, particularly your insights on social media analytics. I'd appreciate the opportunity to connect and learn more about your career path in this field.\"\n\n## Your Networking Task\n\n**You do: Send at least one connection request with a personalized message to a peer or mentor on the designated platform.**\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. **Select your recipient carefully**: Choose someone whose background, experience, or interests align with your educational or career goals. This could be:\n   - A current or former student from your program\n   - An industry professional in your field of interest\n   - A teacher or mentor outside your immediate circle\n   - A speaker from a webinar or online event you attended\n\n2. **Research before reaching out**: Review their profile thoroughly to find specific points of connection or interest that you can reference.\n\n3. **Craft your personalized message**: Keep it concise (2-3 sentences) but meaningful. Include:\n   - Your name and status as an Excel High School student\n   - A specific reason for connecting\n   - Something that shows you've done your homework about them\n\n4. **Proofread carefully**: Check for spelling, grammar, and tone before sending.\n\n5. **Follow up appropriately**: If they accept, consider sending a brief thank-you message, but don't immediately ask for favors or overwhelm them with questions.\n\nRemember that networking is a long-term investment. Not everyone will respond, and that's okay. Focus on quality connections rather than quantity, and approach each interaction with authenticity and professionalism.\n\n## Over to You:\n1. What specific aspects of the recipient's background or experience prompted you to reach out to them?\n2. How did you tailor your message to demonstrate genuine interest in connecting with this particular person?\n3.
