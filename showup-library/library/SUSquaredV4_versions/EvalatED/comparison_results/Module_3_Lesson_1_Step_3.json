In this hands-on activity, you'll have the opportunity to work directly with an AI dashboard designed to help you track and optimize your learning journey. As a credit recovery student, managing your time and monitoring your progress are essential skills for academic success. This lab will give you practical experience using technology tools that provide immediate feedback on your study habits and help you make data-informed decisions about your learning approach. By the end of this session, you'll have set up personalized goals, tracked actual study sessions, and interpreted AI-generated feedback to improve your learning efficiency.\n\n## Setting Up Your Weekly Goal\n\n### Step 1: Access the AI Dashboard\n\n1. Log in to your student portal\n2. Navigate to the \"Learning Tools\" section\n3. Select \"Progress Monitoring Dashboard\"\n4. Click on \"New Weekly Goal\"\n\n### Step 2: Create a SMART Goal\n\nYour first task is to create a specific, measurable goal for this week's studying. The AI dashboard will help you structure this properly.\n\n1. Select the subject you want to focus on from the dropdown menu\n2. In the \"Weekly Goal\" field, enter a specific target using the SMART framework:\n   - **Specific**: Clearly state what you want to accomplish\n   - **Measurable**: Include numbers or percentages\n   - **Achievable**: Be realistic about what you can do in one week\n   - **Relevant**: Connect to your credit recovery needs\n   - **Time-bound**: Set deadlines within the week\n\nExample of a well-structured goal: \"Complete 3 math lessons with at least 80% accuracy by Friday at 5 PM.\"\n\n### Step 3: Set Study Parameters\n\nThe AI needs information about your study habits to provide meaningful feedback:\n\n1. Select your preferred study environment(s)\n2. Indicate your best time of day for focused work\n3. Choose your preferred study duration (15-90 minutes)\n4. Select any tools or resources you plan to use\n\nClick \"Save Weekly Goal\" when complete. The dashboard will display your goal with a visual progress tracker.\n\n## Logging Study Sessions\n\nNow that you've established your goal, you'll need to log at least two actual study sessions to generate meaningful feedback.\n\n### Step 1: Start Your First Study Session\n\n1. When you're ready to begin studying, return to the dashboard\n2. Click \"Start New Study Session\"\n3. The timer will begin tracking your study duration\n4. Work on your subject material as planned\n\n### Step 2: Complete Session Details\n\nAfter finishing your study session:\n\n1. Click \"End Session\"\n2. Rate your focus level during the session (1-10)\n3. Select which specific topics you covered\n4. Note any challenges you encountered\n5. Record what you accomplished (problems completed, pages read, etc.)\n6. Upload any evidence of work (optional)\n\n### Step 3: Log a Second Session\n\nFollow the same process to log a second study session. Try to space this session at least a few hours apart from the first one to get more meaningful feedback.\n\n1. Return to the dashboard when ready for another session\n2. Click \"Start New Study Session\"\n3. Complete your studying\n4. End the session and fill in the details\n\nThe AI requires at least two data points to generate personalized feedback on your study patterns.\n\n## Interpreting AI Feedback\n\nAfter logging two or more study sessions, the AI dashboard will generate personalized feedback to help you optimize your learning approach.\n\n### Step 1: Access Your Feedback Report\n\n1. From the dashboard, click \"View Progress Report\"\n2. Review the visual representation of your study sessions\n3. Note the AI-generated observations and recommendations\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Key Metrics\n\nThe dashboard will highlight several important metrics:\n\n1. **Productivity Score**: How effective your study time was based on your self-reported focus and accomplishments\n2. **Optimal Study Time**: When you seem most focused based on your session data\n3. **Pacing Analysis**: Whether you're on track to meet your weekly goal\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: Any habits or approaches that seem to be helping or hindering your progress\n\n### Step 3: Apply Recommendations\n\nThe final step is to apply what you've learned:\n\n1. Review the AI's specific suggestions for improving your study approach\n2. Select at least one recommendation to implement in your next study session\n3. Update your weekly goal if necessary based on the feedback\n4. Schedule your next study session at the AI-recommended optimal time\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations on completing the Progress-Monitoring Lab! You've now experienced how AI tools can help you set meaningful goals, track your progress, and receive personalized feedback to improve your learning efficiency. This hands-on practice with the dashboard gives you a powerful tool for your credit recovery journey. Remember that the more consistently you use the dashboard, the more accurate and helpful its recommendations will become. Continue using this tool throughout your courses to maintain awareness of your progress and continuously improve your study habits.",
