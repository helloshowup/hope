Today, we'll be working together to build an effective time-blocking system using a digital calendar. Time-blocking is one of the most powerful productivity techniques used by successful students and professionals alike. Instead of just creating a to-do list, time-blocking involves actually scheduling specific blocks of time for your tasks and commitments. As I demonstrate each step on my screen, I'd like you to follow along on your own device, creating your personalized time-blocked calendar.\n\n## Workshop Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up Your Calendar\n\nI'm going to share my screen now so you can see exactly what I'm doing. Please open your preferred digital calendar application (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, etc.) on your device.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we're viewing the weekly format, as this gives us the best overview for time-blocking. Notice how I'm clicking on the \"Week\" view option at the top of my calendar. Please do the same on your calendar now.\n\n### Step 2: Blocking Fixed Commitments\n\nLet's start by adding your fixed commitments - these are the non-negotiable activities that happen at specific times, like classes, work shifts, or regular meetings.\n\nWatch as I create a new event by clicking on Monday at 9:00 AM. I'm labeling this \"Math Class\" and setting it to repeat every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I'm also selecting a specific color to represent academic commitments.\n\nNow it's your turn - please add your fixed commitments to your calendar, following the same process. Use different colors for different categories of activities (classes, work, personal appointments, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Adding Study Blocks\n\nNow I'm adding dedicated study blocks to my calendar. Notice how I'm creating a 90-minute block labeled \"Math Study Session\" right after my math class on Monday. Research shows that reviewing material shortly after learning it significantly improves retention.\n\nPlease mirror this approach by adding study blocks for your courses. Aim for at least 2 hours of study time for each hour of class time, broken into manageable blocks of 60-90 minutes.\n\n### Step 4: Scheduling Personal Time and Self-Care\n\nIt's essential to block time for personal activities and self-care. Watch as I add blocks for exercise, meals, and downtime. I'm adding a 45-minute \"Morning Workout\" block at 7:00 AM and a 30-minute \"Lunch Break\" at noon.\n\nNow, add your personal time blocks to your calendar. Remember that scheduling self-care isn't selfish\u2014it's necessary for sustainable productivity.\n\n### Step 5: Creating Task Blocks\n\nFor less structured work, I'm adding flexible \"task blocks.\" Watch as I create a 2-hour block labeled \"Assignment Work\" on Tuesday afternoon. Within this block, I'll work on various assignments based on priority.\n\nPlease add your own task blocks now, considering when you tend to have the most mental energy for challenging work.\n\n### Step 6: Adding Buffer Time\n\nNotice how I'm not scheduling activities back-to-back. I'm leaving 15-30 minute buffers between blocks to account for transitions, unexpected delays, or simply to give my brain a rest.\n\nPlease add appropriate buffer time between your scheduled blocks as well.\n\n### Step 7: Weekly Review and Adjustment\n\nFinally, I'm adding a 30-minute \"Weekly Planning\" block on Sunday evening to review the upcoming week and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nPlease add this important review block to your calendar as well.\n\nAs you continue to follow along and build your time",
