This exercise develops your ability to communicate ideas persuasively while demonstrating effective leadership distribution within your team.\n\n## Pitch Structure\nEach team will have 7-10 minutes to present their chosen opportunity, followed by 3-5 minutes of questions. Your pitch should clearly outline:\n- The specific opportunity and its potential value\n- Why your team is uniquely positioned to pursue it\n- How leadership roles and responsibilities will be distributed\n- Initial implementation strategy\n\n## Team Preparation Guidelines\n1. Assign specific speaking roles to each team member\n2. Designate a team leader who will introduce the pitch and manage transitions\n3. Allocate specialized roles based on individual strengths (research presenter, financial analyst, etc.)\n4. Prepare visual aids that enhance your presentation\n5. Rehearse your timing and transitions between speakers\n\nRemember that evaluators will assess both your opportunity analysis and how effectively your team demonstrates collaborative leadership principles.",
