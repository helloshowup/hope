This guide will help you effectively invite your guardian to comment on your project scope through the Excel High School portal. By involving your guardian in this early planning stage, you'll gain additional insights that can help shape your project direction and potentially identify areas you hadn't considered.\n\n## Why Guardian Collaboration Matters\nGuardian involvement in your educational journey creates a stronger support network and helps bridge the gap between home and school. When you invite your guardian to review your project scope, you're not only keeping them informed about your academic work but also leveraging their life experience and perspective. Their input might help you identify potential challenges, refine your focus, or even expand your thinking in new directions.\n\n## Steps to Invite Guardian Comment\n\n1. **Prepare Your Project Scope**\n   Before inviting your guardian's input, make sure your project scope is clearly articulated. Include the project objectives, key questions you're exploring, resources you plan to use, and your timeline. The more clearly you can explain your project, the more meaningful feedback you'll receive.\n\n2. **Access the Guardian Communication Feature**\n   Log into your Excel High School student portal and navigate to the project workspace. Look for the \"Guardian Collaboration\" or \"Share with Guardian\" option within your project management area.\n\n3. **Compose a Clear Invitation Message**\n   Write a brief but specific message to your guardian explaining:\n   - What the project is about\n   - What aspects you'd particularly like feedback on\n   - Any specific questions you have\n   - When you hope to receive their input\n\n   For example: \"Hi Mom, I've started planning my history research project on local immigration patterns. Could you review my project scope and share your thoughts, especially on whether my research questions seem focused enough? I'd appreciate your feedback by Thursday so I can make adjustments before submitting my final plan.\"\n\n4. **Follow Up**\n   After sending the invitation through the portal, you might want to mention it in person or via text to make sure your guardian knows to check the portal. Once they provide feedback, be sure to thank them and let them know how their input helped shape your project.\n\nRemember, this collaboration process is designed to enhance your learning experience while building stronger communication with your support network at home.",
