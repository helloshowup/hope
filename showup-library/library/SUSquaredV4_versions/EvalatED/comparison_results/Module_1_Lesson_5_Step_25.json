  "best_version": "# Parent Sign-Off for Field Work\n\n## Introduction\nBefore students can participate in service fieldwork activities, Excel High School requires parental or guardian approval. This digital signature process ensures that guardians are fully informed about the nature of the fieldwork, potential risks, and educational benefits. This important step protects both students and the school while promoting transparent communication between Excel High School and families.\n\n## What is the Parent Sign-Off?\nThe Parent Sign-Off is a digital signature that legally documents a parent or guardian's approval for their student to participate in service fieldwork. This electronic form includes details about the specific fieldwork activity, location, duration, supervision, and any special requirements or considerations. By providing their digital signature, parents acknowledge they have reviewed this information and consent to their student's participation.\n\n## Why is a Digital Signature Required?\nA digital signature is required for several important reasons:\n\n1. **Legal Protection**: The signature serves as documentation that proper consent was obtained before a minor participated in off-campus activities.\n\n2. **Safety Assurance**: It confirms that parents are aware of where their student will be and what activities they'll be performing.\n\n3. **Communication Tool**: The process ensures parents receive complete information about educational activities occurring outside the traditional classroom.\n\n4. **Liability Management**: It helps Excel High School manage risk by ensuring all participants have proper authorization.\n\nNo student may begin service fieldwork until this digital signature has been received and verified by Excel High School staff. The form must be completed for each separate fieldwork activity throughout the academic year.",
