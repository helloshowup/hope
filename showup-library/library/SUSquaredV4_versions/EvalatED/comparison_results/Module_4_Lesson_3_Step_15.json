This important checkpoint helps you avoid potential pitfalls and ensures your plan has a strong foundation.\n\nYour instructor will evaluate several key aspects of your plan:\n- The realism of your goals\n- The appropriateness of your selected activities\n- The sustainability of your proposed schedule\n- The alignment with healthy balance principles\n\nOnce approved, you'll receive feedback and permission to proceed with implementation. If revisions are needed, your instructor will provide specific guidance on how to strengthen your plan.\n\nThis validation step is designed to set you up for success as you work toward creating better balance in your life.",
