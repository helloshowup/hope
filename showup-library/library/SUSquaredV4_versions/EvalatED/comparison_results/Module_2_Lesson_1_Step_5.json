This important step allows you to demonstrate your mastery of BC_NET concepts covered in Week 1. Your portfolio serves as both a learning tool and an assessment of your progress. By organizing and submitting your work, you'll not only show what you've learned but also create a valuable resource for future reference. This submission represents the culmination of your first week's learning journey and is essential before progressing to more advanced concepts.\n\n## Understanding the Portfolio Submission Process\n\nYour Week 1 portfolio submission is a collection of completed assignments, projects, and reflections that demonstrate your understanding of BC_NET fundamentals. This submission allows your instructor to provide personalized feedback on your work and ensure you've mastered essential concepts before moving forward. The portfolio should include all required elements with proper organization and formatting.\n\nThe submission process is straightforward: gather all required documents, ensure they follow formatting guidelines, compile them into a single PDF if required, and upload to the designated submission area in your student portal. Remember that successful submission confirms you've achieved the foundational knowledge necessary for upcoming, more complex topics.\n\n## Required Portfolio Components\n\nYour Week 1 portfolio submission must include the following elements:\n\n1. **Completed Assignments**: All homework tasks assigned during Week 1, including any worksheets, problem sets, or written responses.\n\n2. **BC_NET Network Diagram**: Your detailed network diagram showing proper topology and configuration based on Week 1 specifications.\n\n3. **Configuration Documentation**: Written documentation of all network configurations you've implemented, including addressing schemes and protocols.\n\n4. **Self-Assessment Reflection**: A brief (250-300 word) reflection discussing your understanding of Week 1 concepts, challenges faced, and areas where you feel confident or need additional practice.\n\nEach component should be clearly labeled with your name, date, and specific assignment title. Ensure all work is neat, organized, and follows the formatting guidelines provided in your syllabus.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nTo successfully submit your Week 1 portfolio:\n\n1. **Review for Completeness**: Double-check that you've included all required components listed above.\n\n2. **Check Formatting**: Ensure all documents follow proper formatting requirements (file type, naming conventions, organization).\n\n3. **Submit Through Portal**: Log into your Excel High School student portal and navigate to the assignment submission area for this course.\n\n4. **Upload Files**: Upload your portfolio as instructed (either as individual files or as a compiled PDF).\n\n5. **Confirm Submission**: Verify that your submission was successful by checking for confirmation messages and reviewing your submission history.\n\nThe deadline for your Week 1 portfolio submission is indicated in your course calendar. Late submissions may be subject to penalties as outlined in your syllabus.\n\n## Over to You:\n\n1.
