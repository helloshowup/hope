This activity gives you the opportunity to apply the collaboration principles you've learned by creating a virtual study group and working together on a shared task. The ability to organize a team, assign appropriate roles, and develop a functional plan are skills that will serve you well in higher education and future careers. Let's put these collaboration skills into practice!\n\n## Forming Your Virtual Study Group\n\nTo complete this micro-project, you'll need to form a virtual study group with 3-4 of your peers. You can connect with classmates through Excel High School's approved communication channels, such as discussion forums, virtual classroom spaces, or other platforms recommended by your instructor.\n\nWhen reaching out to potential group members, be clear about:\n- The purpose of the group\n- The time commitment needed\n- When you hope to meet virtually\n- What tools you'll be using to communicate\n\nRemember that effective groups typically include members with diverse perspectives and complementary skills. Consider reaching out to classmates you haven't worked with before to broaden your collaborative experience.\n\n## Assigning Roles Within Your Group\n\nFor effective collaboration, each team member should have clearly defined responsibilities. Discuss and assign the following roles:\n\n1. **Coordinator/Leader**: Schedules meetings, keeps discussions on track, and ensures everyone has a chance to contribute.\n\n2. **Recorder/Note-taker**: Documents key decisions, action items, and maintains shared files.\n\n3. **Researcher**: Gathers information or resources needed for the project.\n\n4. **Presenter/Editor**: Polishes the final product and prepares it for submission.\n\nDepending on your group size, individuals may need to take on multiple roles, or you might create additional specialized roles that suit your specific project. The key is ensuring that responsibilities are clearly defined and agreed upon by all members.\n\n## Creating Your Collaboration Plan\n\nTogether with your group, develop a brief plan that outlines:\n\n1. **Project Goal**: Define a specific academic task to complete together. This could be:\n   - Creating study guides for an upcoming exam\n   - Developing a presentation on a course topic\n   - Solving a set of complex problems\n   - Analyzing a case study\n\n2. **Timeline**: Establish deadlines for:\n   - Initial research/preparation\n   - Draft completion\n   - Review and revisions\n   - Final submission\n\n3. **Communication Strategy**: Decide how you'll stay connected:\n   - Which platform(s) you'll use\n   - How often you'll check in\n   - Protocol for addressing questions or concerns\n\n4. **Work Division**: Determine who will be responsible for specific parts of the project.\n\n5. **Feedback Process**: Plan how you'll review each other's work and integrate individual contributions.\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\nOnce you've formed your group, assigned roles, and created your collaboration plan, prepare a brief document (1-2 pages) that includes:\n\n1. Group member names and their assigned roles\n2. Your chosen project/task\n3. Your collaboration plan with timeline\n4. A brief reflection on why you chose this organization structure\n\nThis micro-project gives you the opportunity to apply collaboration skills in a structured setting and prepare for more extensive group work in your future studies at Excel High School.",
