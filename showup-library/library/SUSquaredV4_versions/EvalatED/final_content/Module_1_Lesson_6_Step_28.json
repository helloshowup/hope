This is your opportunity to showcase your growth by uploading evidence of your learning journey. In this sprint, you'll revisit three key areas: Community Service Impact, Balance Strategies, and Reflective Practice. This time, we're elevating your understanding from application to evaluation\u2014allowing you to critically assess your work and experiences to draw meaningful conclusions about your development.\n\n## What to Submit\nFor each core concept below, you'll need to submit evidence that demonstrates your ability to **evaluate** rather than simply describe. Your Success Coach is available through the Excel High School portal if you need guidance on selecting appropriate evidence.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Evaluating Community Service Impact\n\nUpload artifacts that demonstrate your ability to evaluate the impact of your community service activities. This means critically assessing:\n\n* Measurable outcomes of your service (both numbers and observed changes)\n* How your contributions addressed specific community needs\n* Whether the impact you created will last\n* Unexpected results or challenges you encountered\n\n**Evidence Examples:**\n* Impact reports with before/after comparisons\n* Testimonials from community members with your analysis\n* Reflection journal that evaluates effectiveness (not just describes activities)\n* Visual documentation with analytical commentary\n\n## Core Concept 2: Evaluating Balance Strategies\n\nUpload evidence showing how you've evaluated the effectiveness of your balance strategies across different areas of your life. Your evaluation should address:\n\n* Which specific strategies worked best/worst for you and why\n* How you've adapted your approach based on changing circumstances\n* Connections between your balance strategies and your overall wellbeing\n\n**Evidence Examples:**\n* Time management logs with your analysis of patterns\n* Comparison chart of different strategies with effectiveness ratings\n* Journal entries that evaluate (not just describe) your balance approaches\n* Before/after snapshots showing how your strategies evolved\n\n## Core Concept 3: Evaluating Reflective Practice\n\nUpload evidence demonstrating your ability to evaluate your own reflective practice skills. This meta-cognitive process involves:\n\n* Assessing the quality and depth of your reflections over time\n* Identifying patterns in how you think and process experiences\n* Analyzing how reflection has influenced your decisions and actions\n\n**Evidence Examples:**\n* Annotated reflective journal with your comments on the quality of earlier entries\n* \"Reflection on your reflections\" that analyzes your growth as a reflective thinker\n* Documentation showing how reflection led to specific changes in your approach\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n* Upload your evidence files in PDF, JPG, or MP4 format\n* Each file should be clearly labeled with your name and the core concept (e.g., \"JSmith_CommunityServiceEvaluation\")\n* Include a brief description (1-2 sentences) with each file explaining what the evidence demonstrates\n* Submit all files through the Evidence Entry portal by [DUE DATE]\n\nRemember, the key is to show evaluation\u2014making informed judgments about effectiveness and impact rather than simply describing what you did.\n\n## Need Help?\nContact your Success Coach through the Excel High School portal or email support@excelhighschool.com if you have questions about this assignment.",
