  "final_content": "# Peer Feedback Loop: Triads Exchange Reflections\n\nIn this activity, you'll work in groups of three to provide meaningful feedback on each other's reflections. This collaborative process helps deepen understanding through critical evaluation of peers' work.\n\n## Process:\n1. Exchange your reflections with your triad members\n2. Read each reflection carefully, looking specifically for evidence of growth and learning\n3. Provide constructive feedback by \"tagging\" specific sentences or paragraphs that demonstrate:\n   - Clear self-awareness\n   - Specific examples of skill development\n   - Thoughtful connections between concepts\n   - Areas where additional reflection could strengthen understanding\n\n## Feedback Guidelines:\nWhen providing feedback, use the \"I notice...\" and \"I wonder...\" format to frame your observations constructively. For example: \n- \"I notice you provided strong evidence of growth in your time management skills.\"\n- \"I wonder how these skills might transfer to other courses?\"\n\n## Time Management:\n- Suggested time: 30 minutes (10 minutes per reflection)\n- Set a timer to help you stay on track\n\n## Submission:\n- After receiving feedback, you'll have the opportunity to revise your reflection\n- Submit both your original reflection and your revised version\n- Include a brief note (2-3 sentences) explaining how the feedback helped improve your work\n\n## Support Resources:\n- Need help? Use the BRYTE AI Tutor for real-time assistance\n- Visit the Writing Lab for additional feedback\n- Contact your Success Coach through the Student Portal if you have questions\n\nThis peer review process helps you develop critical thinking skills while gaining new perspectives on your own learning journey.",
