This guide will help you effectively invite your guardian to comment on your project scope through the Excel High School portal. By involving your guardian in this early planning stage, you'll gain additional insights that can help shape your project direction and potentially identify areas you hadn't considered.\n\n## Why Guardian Collaboration Matters\nGuardian involvement in your educational journey creates a stronger support network and helps bridge the gap between home and school. When you invite your guardian to review your project scope, you're not only keeping them informed about your academic work but also leveraging their life experience and perspective. Their input might help you identify potential challenges, refine your focus, or even expand your thinking in new directions.\n\n## Steps to Invite Guardian Comment\n\n1. **Prepare Your Project Scope**\n   Before inviting your guardian's input, make sure your project scope is clearly articulated. Include the project objectives, key questions you're exploring, resources you plan to use, and your timeline. The more clearly you can explain your project, the more meaningful feedback you'll receive.\n\n2. **Access the Guardian Communication Feature**\n   * Log into your Excel High School student portal\n   * Navigate to \"My Courses\" and select your current project course\n   * Click on the \"Guardian Collaboration\" tab in the left navigation menu\n   * Select \"Share Project for Review\" from the dropdown options\n\n3. **Compose a Clear Invitation Message**\n   Write a brief but specific message to your guardian explaining:\n   - What the project is about\n   - What aspects you'd particularly like feedback on\n   - Any specific questions you have\n   - When you hope to receive their input\n\n   **Example Message Template:**\n   ```\n   Hi [Guardian Name],\n\n   I've started planning my [subject] project on [topic]. Could you review my project scope using the link below and share your thoughts, especially on [specific area for feedback]?\n\n   I'd appreciate your feedback by [date] so I can make adjustments before submitting my final plan.\n\n   Thank you!\n   [Your Name]\n   ```\n\n4. **Follow Up and Apply Feedback**\n   * Send a text message or email alert to notify your guardian about the portal invitation\n   * Once they provide feedback, review their comments carefully\n   * Respond to their input through the portal with any follow-up questions\n   * Incorporate relevant suggestions into your project scope\n   * Thank your guardian for their contribution and share how their input helped\n\n## Tips for Successful Guardian Collaboration\n* Schedule a specific time to discuss the project if complex feedback is needed\n* Be open to perspectives that might differ from your initial vision\n* Remember that you make the final decisions about your project\n* Use this as an opportunity to practice professional communication skills\n\nRemember, this collaboration process is designed to enhance your learning experience while building stronger communication with your support network at home.",
