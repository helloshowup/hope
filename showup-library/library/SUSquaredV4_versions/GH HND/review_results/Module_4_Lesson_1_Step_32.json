What does \"check-in/check-out\" functionality in a DAM system prevent?**\n   a) Asset deletion\n   b) Asset viewing\n   c) Simultaneous editing that could lead to version conflicts\n   d) Asset downloading\n\n**9. Which of the following is a best practice for digital asset backup?**\n   a) Store all backups in a single location\n   b) Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media types, 1 off-site\n   c) Only back up final versions of assets\n   d) Backup once per year\n\n**10. What is the main benefit of implementing automated workflows in a digital asset pipeline?**\n    a) Eliminating the need for human creativity\n    b) Reducing storage requirements\n    c) Increasing consistency and efficiency while reducing human error\n    d) Making assets more visually appealing\n\n**11. Which statement about version control is TRUE?**\n    a) Version control is only necessary for text-based assets\n    b) Version control systems track changes, enabling teams to revert to previous states if needed\n    c) Version control requires manual tracking of all file changes in spreadsheets\n    d) Version control systems automatically improve the quality of assets\n\n**12. What is a repository in version control terminology?**\n    a) A physical storage device\n    b) A database of all assets regardless of version\n    c) A data structure storing the project history, files, and metadata\n    d) A list of team members with access to assets\n\n**13. In asset management, what does \"asset lifecycle\" refer to?**\n    a) How quickly assets become outdated\n    b) The stages an asset goes through from creation to retirement\n    c) The file format conversion process\n    d) The loading time of assets in applications\n\n**14.
