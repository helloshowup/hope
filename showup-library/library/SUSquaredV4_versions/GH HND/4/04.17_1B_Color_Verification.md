## Comprehensive Typography Verification Table

| Category | Verification Point | Check (Yes/No/N/A) | Notes/Action Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Font Consistency** | All fonts used are approved and consistent with brand guidelines/design system | | |
| | Multiple fonts (if used) are complementary and visually distinct | | |
| | Formatting (font, background colour, size, alignment) is consistent across similar text elements | | |
| | Default system fonts are used appropriately for web compatibility | | |
| | No missing or inactive font files are present | | |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Clear visual hierarchy established (headings, body, etc.) via size, weight, style | | |
| | Headlines and subheads convey content hierarchy effectively | | |
| | Body copy is easily readable; decorative/thin fonts avoided for long passages | | |
| | Text blocks are concise, using short copy/bulleted lists for scannability | | |
| | Interactive text (links, buttons) is descriptive and clearly visible | | |
| | Centre-aligned text is used sparingly (fewer than three lines) | | |
| | ALL CAPS, italics, bold, underline are used selectively, not for entire paragraphs | | |
| | Backgrounds do not obscure overlay text readability | | |
| **Detailed Spacing** | Leading (line spacing) is adjusted for optimal readability (e.g., 1.5-2.0 for documents) | | |
| | Tracking (letter-spacing) is consistently applied for legibility | | |
| | Kerning (individual letter spacing) is adjusted for problematic pairs | | |
| | Consistent line lengths are maintained within text blocks | | |
| | Sufficient whitespace surrounds text blocks and elements | | |
| **Accessibility** | Minimum body text size is 16px for web content | | |
| | Minimum text size is 12pt (14pt/18pt preferred) for print | | |
| | Text can be resized/zoomed to 200% without loss of content/functionality | | |
| | Spacing (letters, words, lines, paragraphs) is adjustable without loss of content | | |

## Colour System Essentials

### Brand Adherence and Palette Consistency

Colour builds brand recognition through:

- Strict adherence to established brand guidelines and defined colour palette
- A simple palette of 2-3 primary colours with supporting shades
- Consistent primary brand colour across all touchpoints
- Clear naming conventions for colours (e.g., "Primary Blue" rather than hex codes)
- Testing colours in various contexts (buttons, text, backgrounds)

Colour serves as a critical accessibility and usability feature that extends beyond aesthetics. Failure to meet colour standards can lead to user exclusion, poor user experience, and potential legal compliance issues.

### Colour Profile Accuracy

Ensure accurate colour reproduction by:

- Verifying colours are correctly set to CMYK or Pantone for print, RGB for digital
- Calibrating computer screens to accurately represent final output
- Understanding how uncalibrated screens can distort colour perception
- Implementing a defined colour system for design consistency and efficiency

A systematic approach to colour management prevents mismatched colours, accessibility issues, and wasted resources when moving between digital and print environments.

### Contrast Ratios for Accessibility

Meet WCAG accessibility guidelines by ensuring:

- Paragraph text maintains a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (AA compliance)
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold+) maintains a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio (AA)
- For AAA compliance: 7:1 ratio for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text
- Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify ratios
- Test print materials in black and white to reveal potential contrast issues

The interplay between digital and print colour considerations requires different approaches to quality control, as a design that appears perfect on a digital screen may print inaccurately if not properly prepared.

### Functional Use of Colour

Colour must serve functional purposes beyond aesthetics:

- Never use colour as the sole means of conveying information
- Add underlines or icons to links (not just colour)
- Include text or symbols with coloured indicators (e.g., error messages)
- Test various colour pairings for readability
- Apply consistent colour variations for interactive states (hover, clicked)

This ensures that all users, including those with visual impairments or colour blindness, can successfully navigate and understand your design.
