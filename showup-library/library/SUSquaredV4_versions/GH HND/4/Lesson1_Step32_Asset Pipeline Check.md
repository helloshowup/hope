## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

**Over to You:** After completing this quiz, consider how you would implement these asset management principles in your current design project. What naming conventions would you use? How would you structure your folders? What metadata would be most valuable for your specific assets? Make notes on these decisions to apply to your portfolio work.

## SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Submit your completed quiz through the Excel High School learning management system. Your instructor will review your answers and provide feedback on your understanding of asset management principles.

**Next Steps:** After receiving your quiz results, review any concepts you found challenging. Strong asset management practices will be essential for your upcoming portfolio development in Module 4.
