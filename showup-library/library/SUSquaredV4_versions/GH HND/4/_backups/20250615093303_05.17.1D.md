- [ ] Orientation changes (portrait/landscape) are handled gracefully

### Responsive Design Essentials

#### Content Reflow and Adaptability

Verify that content adapts appropriately by ensuring:

- Text, images, forms, and UI components rearrange and scale to fit different screen sizes
- Content collapses into a single column on smaller devices
- No horizontal scrolling is required at 320 CSS pixels width (WCAG 1.4.10)
- All content remains accessible when zooming to 400%
- Responsive design is implemented as a fundamental requirement for accessibility

#### Image Scaling and Optimization

Images must function effectively across devices by:

- Scaling correctly without distortion, pixelation, or horizontal overflow
- Magnifying with minimal visual degradation when users zoom
- Being optimized for performance on different devices
- Loading quickly without burdening mobile data plans

#### Interactive Element Behavior

Test functionality across varying screen sizes by verifying:

- Forms expand appropriately and are easy to use with touch input
- Buttons are sufficiently large for comfortable tapping (minimum 44×44px)
- Navigation elements (including hamburger menus) are discoverable and functional
- Submenus, dropdowns, and search boxes transition smoothly without going off-screen
- Pop-ups are responsive and don't obstruct essential content
- Critical user journeys work seamlessly across all devices

#### Cross-Device and Browser Compatibility

Ensure consistent rendering by:

- Testing across multiple devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops)
- Verifying compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Using both device emulators and real devices for testing
- Implementing comprehensive cross-browser testing protocols
- Considering automated viewport testing for efficiency

#### Accessibility in Responsive Layouts

Support various accessibility features by confirming:

- Users can zoom on mobile devices
- Text resizes to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Spacing between text elements remains adjustable
- Content works in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Interactive elements have sufficiently large touch targets for users with motor impairments
