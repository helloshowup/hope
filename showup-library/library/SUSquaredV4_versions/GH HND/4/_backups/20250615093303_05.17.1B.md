### Color System Essentials

#### Brand Adherence and Palette Consistency

Color builds brand recognition through:

- Strict adherence to established brand guidelines and defined color palette
- A simple palette of 2-3 primary colors with supporting shades
- Consistent primary brand color across all touchpoints
- Clear naming conventions for colors (e.g., "Primary Blue" rather than hex codes)
- Testing colors in various contexts (buttons, text, backgrounds)

#### Color Profile Accuracy

Ensure accurate color reproduction by:

- Verifying colors are correctly set to CMYK or Pantone for print, RGB for digital
- Calibrating computer screens to accurately represent final output
- Understanding how uncalibrated screens can distort color perception
- Implementing a defined color system for design consistency and efficiency

#### Contrast Ratios for Accessibility

Meet WCAG accessibility guidelines by ensuring:

- Paragraph text maintains a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (AA compliance)
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold+) maintains a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio (AA)
- For AAA compliance: 7:1 ratio for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text
- Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify ratios
- Test print materials in black and white to reveal potential contrast issues

#### Functional Use of Color

Color must serve functional purposes beyond aesthetics:

- Never use color as the sole means of conveying information
- Add underlines or icons to links (not just color)
- Include text or symbols with colored indicators (e.g., error messages)
- Test various color pairings for readability
- Apply consistent color variations for interactive states (hover, clicked)
