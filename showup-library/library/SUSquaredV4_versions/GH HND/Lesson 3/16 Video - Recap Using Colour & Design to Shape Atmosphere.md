# Recap Using Colour & Design to Shape Atmosphere

Imagine walking into two different cafés \- one has a soft neutral palette and a bright open plan layout \- the other has industrial brick and concrete walls and a towering factory height ceiling. Before you've even sat down, you've formed **strong emotional impressions** about each space.

In graphic design, these same principles apply to the visual created.   
Whether designing a website, creating a brand identity, or marketing collateral \- the **strategic use of colou**r creates an immediate emotional response that shapes how audiences **perceive** and **interact** with designs

\[VISUAL: Colour wheel with emotional associations highlighted for primary and secondary colours\]

You're already familiar with the basic **associations of colour** like reds energise, blues build trust, and yellows suggest optimism. But It is the most effective designers who will understand how to **tailor colour strategies** to specific audiences.

For corporate finance clients, navy combined with muted teal and grey creates a feeling of stability and trustworthiness. And the occasional gold accent adds sophistication without undermining credibility.

Branding for a summer camp for example \- calls for a vibrant, adventurous approach. Using Bright sky blue, sunny yellow, and fresh grass green will evoke the outdoors and a sense of fun, freedom, and exploration. 

These colours capture the spirit of summer and appeal to children and parents alike, reflecting a dynamic environment where kids can learn, play, and grow through memorable experiences.

The most common mistake is choosing colours based on personal preference rather than what will attract or **resonate with the target audience**. Remember that your emotional response to a colour may differ significantly from the associations your target audience may make.

Just as we carefully select colour palettes to evoke specific feelings, the **typefaces** we choose also carry their own **psychological weight** and **personality**. In professional graphic design, these elements must work in **harmony**. A disconnect between your colour choice and typographic tone can create jarring experiences that confuse viewers and undermine your communication goals.  
Typography works as your design's **emotional voice,** with each typeface family carrying distinct psychological qualities.

The font **Helvetica Neue** (pronounced Noyuh) conveys a sense of modernity and authority, though it can feel somewhat cold, whereas **Playfair Display** blends sophistication and modernity with a more approachable tone. **Strategic font pairings** amplify emotional tone—**Playfair** with **Open Sans** creates sophisticated trust, while **Quicksand** with **Lato** (pronounced Lah\-toe) suggests warm approachability.

A unified visual language develops through the **harmonious interaction** of all design elements. **Colour** temperature sets the foundation with for example warm tones creating intimacy or cool tones suggesting calm reflection. **Composition** then reinforces this feeling with the use of tight framing to increase emotional intensity or open space to promote contemplation.

And **the impact of these principles is measurable**. ~~When a wellness website replaced inconsistent visuals with a cohesive palette of blues and greens alongside authentic imagery, \- user perception shifted dramatically—72% described it as "welcoming" rather than "clinical," therefore increasing time-on-site by 45%.~~

You will learn to measure these emotional impacts through user testing and engagement metrics, building on these principles to create designs that powerfully connect with audiences.
