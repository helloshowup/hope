These skills are essential for producing professional-quality graphics that meet industry standards.\n\n## QUALITY CONTROL ASSESSMENT (15 Questions)\n\n### Color Profile Management\n\n1. Which color profile is most appropriate for digital designs intended for web display?\n   a) CMYK\n   b) sRGB\n   c) Adobe RGB\n   d) ProPhoto RGB\n\n2. When preparing a document for commercial printing, which color profile should you use?\n   a) sRGB\n   b) CMYK\n   c) RGB\n   d) HSB\n\n3. What does ICC stand for in the context of color management?\n   a) International Color Consortium\n   b) Integrated Color Control\n   c) Internal Color Calibration\n   d) Image Color Correction\n\n4. What is color gamut?\n   a) The temperature of colors in a design\n   b) The range of colors a device can reproduce\n   c) The brightness settings of a monitor\n   d) The contrast between colors in an image\n\n5. Which statement about color calibration is true?\n   a) It only needs to be done once when you purchase a new device\n   b) It should be performed regularly to maintain color accuracy\n   c) It's only necessary for photography, not graphic design\n   d) It's the same as increasing saturation in an image\n\n### Output Settings\n\n6. When preparing a PDF for high-quality print, which setting is most important?\n   a) Compression set to maximum\n   b) Web optimization enabled\n   c) High-resolution (at least 300 dpi)\n   d) Lowest file size possible\n\n7. What does \"bleed\" refer to in print preparation?\n   a) Color saturation issues\n   b) Extra image area that extends beyond the trim edge\n   c) Text that appears too light\n   d) Printer ink spreading on absorbent paper\n\n8. When exporting images for web use, which file format typically offers the best balance of quality and file size for photographs?\n   a) GIF\n   b) PNG\n   c) JPEG\n   d) SVG\n\n9. What is the purpose of soft proofing?\n   a) Testing image resolution\n   b) Previewing how colors will appear when printed\n   c) Checking file sizes\n   d) Verifying font compatibility\n\n10. What does PPI stand for in digital graphics production?\n    a) Pixels Per Image\n    b) Print Production Index\n    c) Pixels Per Inch\n    d) Progressive Print Integration\n\n### Mockups and Prototypes\n\n11. What is the primary purpose of creating a high-fidelity mockup?\n    a) To test different color schemes\n    b) To provide a realistic representation of the final product\n    c) To reduce production costs\n    d) To increase file compatibility\n\n12. Which of the following is NOT typically included in a high-fidelity prototype?\n    a) Actual content and images\n    b) Working navigation\n    c) Final backend functionality\n    d) Accurate color schemes\n\n13. When creating a mockup of a product package, which aspect is most important to accurately represent?\n    a) File size\n    b) Scale and proportions\n    c) Creation date\n    d) Layer names\n\n14. What is the advantage of using smart objects in mockup creation?\n    a) They automatically adjust the mockup's color scheme\n    b) They allow non-destructive editing and easy content replacement\n    c) They reduce the overall file size\n    d) They eliminate the need for color profiles\n\n15. Which quality control check should be performed last before delivering a final design?\n    a) Spell check\n    b) Resolution verification\n    c) Color profile confirmation\n    d) Comprehensive visual inspection of all elements\n\n## ASSESSMENT CRITERIA\n\n- Each question is worth 1 point, for a total of 15 possible points\n- A passing score is 12/15 or higher (80%)\n- This assessment evaluates your understanding of quality control principles that are essential for professional-level digital graphics production\n\n## SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Review each question carefully before selecting your answer\n2. Double-check your responses before final submission\n3. Submit your completed assessment through the course portal\n4. Your results will be available immediately after submission\n\n## PREPARATION TIPS\n\n- Review your notes on color management systems\n- Practice identifying appropriate file formats for different output scenarios\n- Revisit the mockup creation techniques covered in the module\n\nGood luck with your assessment!",
