The prompt contains instructions and the learner profile, but the section where the content should be shows an error message rather than the material I'm supposed to review.\n\nTo help you with this task, I'll need to see the actual learning content that requires editing. Once you provide that, I can make the appropriate minor edits to improve accessibility for first-year students at Open Window South Africa Higher Education, following the guidelines you've outlined.\n\nPlease share the content that needs editing, and I'll be happy to assist you with making targeted improvements while maintaining the core substance of the material.",
