There seems to be a reference to \"three versions of content about historical film movements\" that weren't successfully transmitted.\n\nTo properly complete this task, I would need to see the actual learning material that requires editing. Once you provide the content, I can make the appropriate minor edits to improve accessibility for the target learner profile while maintaining the core substance of the material.\n\nPlease share the content you'd like me to edit, and I'll be happy to apply the guidelines you've outlined.",
