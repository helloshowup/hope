The three versions of content that I'm supposed to analyze are missing (they show as \"Error generating content with Claude API\"). Without being able to see the original content versions, I cannot properly analyze them and create an optimized version.\n\nTo help you properly, I would need:\n1. The three generations of content about Soviet Montage that I'm supposed to analyze\n2. The template structure that I should follow for the final version\n\nOnce you provide these missing elements, I'll be able to create the best version tailored to your first-year Open Window South Africa students and explain my reasoning.",
