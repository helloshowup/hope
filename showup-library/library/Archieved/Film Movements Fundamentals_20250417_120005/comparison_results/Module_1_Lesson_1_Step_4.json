The three versions of content you wanted me to analyze are missing (they show as \"Error generating content with Claude API\"). Without being able to see the original content versions, I cannot perform the comparative analysis and create an optimized version as requested.\n\nTo help you properly, I would need to see the three generations of content about French Surrealism that I'm supposed to analyze and improve upon. Once you provide those versions, I'll be happy to:\n\n1. Analyze their strengths and weaknesses\n2. Create an optimized version tailored to first-year students at Open Window South Africa\n3. Explain my reasoning for the changes made\n\nPlease resubmit your request with the three content versions included, and I'll provide a comprehensive response following your detailed instructions.",
