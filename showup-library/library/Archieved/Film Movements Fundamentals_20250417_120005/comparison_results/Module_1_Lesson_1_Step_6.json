The three versions of content that I'm supposed to analyze are showing as error messages rather than actual content. Without being able to see the three generations of content about French Surrealism or Giallo cinema, I cannot properly analyze them or create an optimized version.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with this task, please provide the three versions of content that need to be analyzed.
