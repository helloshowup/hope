  "final_content": "I notice you haven't included the actual learning content for me to edit. Based on your instructions, I'd be happy to transform AI-detected content into more human-like, engaging material for your first-year students at Open Window South Africa.\n\nThese students are primarily in their early 20s with varying levels of digital literacy and academic preparation. They're drawn to creative fields but may struggle with the transition to higher education, maintaining engagement in online environments, and managing their time effectively.\n\nWhen you share the content, I'll focus on:\n- Making complex concepts more accessible\n- Clarifying potentially confusing ideas\n- Adding brief explanations for unfamiliar terms\n- Improving formatting for better readability\n- Making targeted changes to address learning barriers\n\nI'll keep edits focused on accessibility rather than completely rewriting the material, and I'll avoid self-referencing terms like \"module.\"\n\nPlease share the content you'd like me to edit, and I'll apply these principles to make it more suitable for your target learners.",

Changed American spelling to British (e.g., \"specialised\" instead of \"specialized\")\n4. Added \"Over to You\" headings for reflection practices\n5. Varied sentence structure and made language more conversational while maintaining professionalism\n6. Improved flow between sections and ideas to sound more natural\n7. Added some rhetorical questions to engage students directly\n8. Simplified some complex phrasing while preserving the core information",
