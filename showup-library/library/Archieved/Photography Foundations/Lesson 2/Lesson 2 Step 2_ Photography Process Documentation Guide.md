# Lesson 2 Step 2: Documenting Your Photography Journey

## **Why Keep a Record?**

Maintaining a documentation practice transforms casual picture-taking into a professional endeavor. Beyond aiding your memory, systematically documenting your process showcases your decision-making abilities, builds your creative identity, and provides insights to accelerate your growth. This guide offers practical tools that seamlessly integrate into your workflow, regardless of the gear you use.

## **How to Utilize These Resources**

The following templates and guides can be downloaded as PDFs and incorporated into your photography routine. You don't need to employ every form for each project—start with the ones most relevant to your current work, then gradually introduce others as your process evolves.

These resources are designed to be adaptable: complete them digitally, print them for on-location use, or modify them to suit your personal workflow. The goal is to develop consistent documentation habits that enhance your photography practice rather than burden it.

## **Essential Documentation Tools**

### **1\. Project Brief Template**

A structured brief captures vision and requirements for any photographic work:

* Project objectives and intended outcomes  
* Visual references and inspiration sources  
* Technical parameters and deliverable specifications  
* Timeline milestones and completion criteria

For personal projects, this template clarifies your creative intentions, making self-directed work more focused.

### **2\. Technical Documentation Form**

Record the technical aspects of your photography to build a reference library of techniques:

* Camera and lens combinations with rationale  
* Exposure settings with decision notes  
* Lighting setup details with diagrams  
* Special techniques or equipment adaptations

### **3\. Shot Planning Worksheet**

Transform vague shooting intentions into structured plans:

* Shot categories by priority  
* Lighting and composition notes  
* Equipment requirements  
* Location details and access notes

### **4\. File Management System**

Ensure your growing image collection remains accessible and protected:

**File Format Documentation:**

Here's what you'll need to track for different file formats:

* **RAW Files:** Document your camera-specific format (NEF for Nikon, CR3 for Canon, ARW for Sony), processing software, and backup strategy. RAW captures unprocessed sensor data, preserving maximum information for editing flexibility. In this foundational unit, we'll focus on using RAW when you need maximum editing control for high-quality work or challenging lighting conditions. You'll explore more intricate RAW processing techniques in the higher-level course.

* **JPEG Files:** Record compression settings, color space selections (sRGB for web, Adobe RGB for printing), and delivery specifications. Though compressed with less editing latitude than RAW, JPEGs remain essential for client delivery and web display. For this foundational unit, JPEG will be your primary format for final delivery, social media, or when storage space is limited.

* **Smartphone Image Formats:** Most smartphones capture images in JPEG or HEIC (High-Efficiency Image Format) by default. Some newer models offer "Pro" modes that can capture RAW files (often DNG format). For this foundational course, document which format your phone uses and whether you've enabled any special capture modes. In your settings, you can typically choose between "High Efficiency" (HEIC) or "Most Compatible" (JPEG). HEIC files are smaller but may require conversion for sharing, while JPEGs are universally compatible.

* **TIFF Files:** Note bit depth selections (8-bit vs 16-bit), compression options, and layer preservation settings. TIFFs maintain image quality through editing cycles while offering better compatibility than RAW. While we'll introduce TIFF files in this foundational unit, you'll explore their advanced applications during the higher-level course, where you'll learn when to use them for archiving edited work, printing, or collaborating with others.

**Note:** For this foundational unit, we'll primarily focus on working with JPEG and RAW formats. The higher-level course will provide deeper exploration of all file formats, their technical specifications, and advanced workflow integration.

**Naming Convention:** Create consistent file names incorporating date (YYYYMMDD), project name, sequence number, and version indicators. Example: 20240313\_ClientPortrait\_001\_Edit1.raw

**Folder Structure:** Document your organization system to maintain consistency:

Photography/

├── 2024/

│   ├── Commercial/

│   ├── Personal/

│   └── Client\_Name/

**Cloud Storage Integration:** If using cloud services (like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Adobe Cloud), apply the same folder structure and naming conventions. Consider using cloud storage for backup and client delivery while keeping master files locally for faster editing.

### **5\. Color Calibration Records**

Maintain color accuracy with thorough calibration documentation:

* Monitor calibration dates and settings  
* Calibration device used (brand and model)  
* Target color temperature (typically 6500K)  
* Target gamma (typically 2.2)  
* Printing profiles for different papers

\[Image: Photographer using a colorimeter to calibrate a monitor. Caption: "Fig 8: Monitor calibration process showing a colorimeter device attached to a display and corresponding calibration software interface"\]

**Basic Calibration Method:** If you're new to calibration, start with your operating system's built-in tools (Display Calibration Assistant on Mac or Display Color Calibration on Windows). For more accuracy, consider borrowing a calibration device or investing in an entry-level colorimeter like the Datacolor Spyder or X-Rite ColorMunki.

## **Documentation in Action**

### **Wedding Photography Example**

Consider how documentation serves a wedding assignment:

**Before:** The photographer completes a brief with the couple, documenting their vision, family dynamics, and must-have moments. A detailed shot list organized by time ensures nothing is missed. Technical documentation includes equipment preparation and file format decisions.

**During:** The photographer references documentation to track progress while noting any spontaneous opportunities.

**After:** Post-processing documentation records color grading approaches and delivery formats. Client feedback helps refine the photographer's approach for future weddings.

**Additional Examples:**

**Portrait Session:** Documentation includes client preferences, location scouting notes, lighting diagrams, and post-processing workflow.

**Product Photography:** Documentation focuses on consistent product positioning, lighting setup diagrams, and color accuracy verification procedures.

\[Image: Product photography technical documentation with positioning template. Caption: "Fig 11: Product photography documentation showing consistent positioning template, lighting diagram, and color accuracy verification process"\]

**Landscape Photography:** Documentation emphasizes location access information, seasonal considerations, equipment checklists for remote shooting, and field notes about atmospheric conditions.

**In our experience working with photography students, those who thoroughly document their shoots often express more confidence going into their next booking.**

**Note:** Your documentation system should serve your photography, not burden it. Start simply, then develop more detailed practices as they prove valuable to your work.
