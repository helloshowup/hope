# **MODULE 3, STEP 7- FOCUS AS A CREATIVE TOOL**

## **VIDEO SCRIPT**

Focus isn't just about clarityâ€”it's about directing your viewer's attention, creating mood, and telling a story through what you choose to emphasize or blur out.

At the heart of focus as a creative tool is something called depth of field. Simply put, depth of field refers to the zone in your image that appears acceptably sharp. Everything in front of or behind this zone gradually becomes blurrier.

**\[VISUAL: Three images of the same subject showing shallow, medium, and deep depth of field\]**

Depth of field exists on a spectrum. A shallow depth of field means a very thin slice of your image is in focus, while everything else is blurred. A deep depth of field means most or all of your image appears sharp, from foreground to background.

**\[VISUAL: Demonstration of aperture changing from f/2.8 to f/16, showing the effect on depth of field\]**

Three main factors control depth of field: aperture, focal length, and distance to your subject. Let's look at each one.

Aperture is the most direct way to control depth of field. Remember that smaller f-numbers like f/1.8 or f/2.8 create a shallow depth of field with lots of background blur. Larger f-numbers like f/11 or f/16 create a deep depth of field where more of the scene appears sharp.

**\[VISUAL: Demonstration of the same portrait shot at different apertures\]**

For this portrait, watch what happens as I change from f/2.8 to f/16. At f/2.8, our subject stands out dramatically against the soft background. At f/16, we can see much more detail in the environment behind them.

**\[VISUAL: Demonstration of focal length effect \- wide angle vs. telephoto of same scene\]**

Your lens choice also affects depth of field. Telephoto lenses naturally create a shallower depth of field than wide-angle lenses. Notice how this 85mm lens creates much more background blur than this 24mm lens at the same aperture.

**\[VISUAL: Demonstration of distance effect \- moving closer and farther from subject\]**

Finally, your distance to the subject matters. The closer you are to your subject, the shallower your depth of field becomes. This is why macro photography often has extremely thin focus planes, even at smaller apertures.

Now let's explore how to use focus creatively. In portraiture, a shallow depth of field helps isolate your subject from distracting backgrounds. The soft blur, often called "bokeh," creates a dreamy quality that draws attention directly to your subject's face.

**\[VISUAL: Example landscape with deep depth of field\]**

For landscapes, photographers typically want everything sharp from foreground to background. Here, a deep depth of field achieved with a smaller aperture like f/11 helps make sure that both the foreground rocks and distant mountains appear crisp and detailed.

**\[VISUAL: Example of selective focus on detail in larger scene\]**

Selective focus can tell compelling stories by highlighting specific elements. In this street scene, focusing on the child's hands while leaving the busy environment blurred communicates something different than if everything were in focus.

**\[VISUAL: Example of intentional blur/soft focus artistic image\]**

Don't be afraid to experiment with intentionally soft focus too. Sometimes a dreamy, ethereal quality created by slight blur can evoke mood and emotion more effectively than perfect sharpness.
