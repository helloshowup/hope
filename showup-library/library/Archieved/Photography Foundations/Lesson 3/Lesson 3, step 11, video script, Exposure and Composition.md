# **Lesson 3, step 11, video script, Exposure and Composition**

We've examined exposure, focus, and composition as separate elements. Now let's see how they work together in practice. You've likely noticed that changing one setting on your camera affects several aspects of your image at once \- this is the reality of photography.

Take aperture, for example. While it controls the amount of light entering your camera, it also determines your depth of field—which shapes how you compose your image. Many new photographers have experienced this common pitfall \- becoming so focused on getting the exposure right that they completely miss how their aperture choice destroys the background separation in their portraits. Working photographers use these relationships intentionally in every shot.

Let's look at a real-world scenario that shows these skills in action: a backlit portrait at sunset. Here's how you might approach it:

* You spot meter on the subject's face and add \+1 exposure compensation to prevent underexposure  
* You select f/2.8 aperture to create pleasing background blur while maintaining essential sharpness  
* You compose using the rule of thirds, positioning the subject to incorporate the dramatic backlighting  
* You increase ISO as needed (perhaps to 400\) since you've already set your aperture and shutter speed needs to stay high enough to avoid camera shake

Each decision serves multiple purposes: your exposure choices preserve facial detail while creating dramatic rim lighting; focus decisions isolate the subject while maintaining key sharpness; compositional choices frame the subject while incorporating the beautiful background.

Most new photographers struggle with this scenario—trying to balance correct exposure with flattering composition while the light fades quickly\!

As you gain experience, you'll develop reliable approaches to technical decisions. Most photographers have an "aha" moment when they stop seeing camera settings as isolated controls and start recognizing their interplay. They understand how adjusting one element affects others, allowing them to anticipate results before pressing the shutter.

This isn't about memorising rules but understanding relationships. A brief change in lighting doesn't throw experienced photographers off because they understand exactly how to compensate through their technical adjustments.

Your approach would be different for other subjects. For example, at indoor events you'd likely:

* Prioritise shutter speed (around 1/125) to freeze motion  
* Set aperture to f/4 for adequate depth of field  
* Adjust ISO (perhaps to 1600\) to maintain proper exposure  
* Compose to incorporate available light sources

The result: consistent, well-exposed images despite challenging conditions.

When things don't work as expected—which happens to everyone—troubleshoot methodically. If your images are too dark despite using the settings above, check whether you need a higher ISO or flash. If motion blur persists, you might need a faster shutter speed and consequently higher ISO. This methodical approach will serve you well as you continue your HNC studies, where your technical understanding forms the foundation for your creative vision—particularly in your upcoming Light and Location Documentation assignment where you'll need to respond to changing lighting conditions.
