# **Lesson 3, step 10 Problem-Solving Through Technical Control**

When you're on location and something goes wrong with your shot, what do you do? The light shifts suddenly. Your subject moves unexpectedly. The camera settings that worked five minutes ago now produce dark, blurry images. These moments test what you've learned about exposure, composition, and focus.

The straightforward process professionals rely on follows three steps: Identify → Analyse → Solve. This method helps photographers spot and fix problems while still on location, preventing the disappointment of returning to the studio only to discover unusable images.

## **Spotting and Fixing Problems**

When an image doesn't look right, run through these checks:

**Is it an exposure issue?** Look at your LCD screen. Is your image clearly too bright or dark? Does it lack contrast? Have you lost detail in shadows or highlights? A quick glance at your histogram can confirm this. Exposure problems typically respond to adjustments in aperture, shutter speed, or ISO.

**Is it a focus issue?** Zoom in on your preview to check sharpness. Focus problems might show up as overall softness, focus on the wrong element, or insufficient depth of field. You might need to change your focus mode, reposition focus points, or adjust your aperture.

**Is it a composition issue?** Sometimes the technical settings are fine, but the image still doesn't work. Does the image feel unbalanced, cluttered, or miss important elements? Composition problems need you to reposition yourself or your subject, change focal length, or adjust framing.

Panic leads to random dial-twisting, which often makes problems worse. Instead:

1. Study your preview image  
2. Identify the specific visual issue  
3. Determine its most likely cause  
4. Make a single adjustment  
5. Check the result

This methodical approach reveals exactly what worked, unlike making three changes simultaneously and guessing which one solved the problem.

## **Case Study: Indoor Portrait with Mixed Lighting**

**Problem:** Your indoor portrait shows an underexposed subject with harsh shadows across their face. You're shooting at f/4, 1/60s, ISO 800\. The background looks properly exposed, but your subject appears dark with unflattering lighting.

\[Image: Indoor portrait showing classic mixed lighting problems \- dark subject with overhead shadows while the background appears properly exposed. Caption: "Fig 4: Common mixed lighting scenario \- underexposed subject with harsh overhead shadows."\]

**Analysis:** This exact problem occurs frequently at corporate events. The camera has likely metered for the brighter background, causing your subject to appear underexposed. Those harsh shadows typically come from overhead office lighting \- a nightmare scenario for portraits\!

**Solution pathways:**

1. Switch to spot metering and meter from the subject's face. Even experienced photographers sometimes forget this simple fix when working quickly.  
2. Dial in some exposure compensation \- try \+1.5 stops to start. Yes, your background might blow out a bit, but your client cares more about their face than the office wall behind them.  
3. Move your subject. Sometimes just turning them 45 degrees or stepping closer to a window creates dramatically better light with no technical changes needed.  
4. Add a touch of fill flash at \-1.0 EV. This technique has saved countless portraits. It fills those nasty shadows without making your subject look "flashed" \- they'll still look naturally lit.

No solution works perfectly in every situation. Spot metering might properly expose your subject's face but blow out a beautiful stained glass window behind them. Fill flash might solve your shadow problems but disturb other guests at a quiet event. The key skill? Deciding which trade-off best serves your specific photographic purpose.
