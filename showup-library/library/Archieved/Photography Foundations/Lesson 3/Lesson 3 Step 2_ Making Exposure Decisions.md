## **A Note on Photography Decision-Making**

We've developed these PDFs as learning tools to help you approach exposure methodically. While they follow standard practices, remember that creative photography often means breaking conventions.

These resources build your technical foundation, but feel free to experiment beyond these guidelines. The aim isn't following formulas—it's developing an intuitive understanding of exposure relationships that will shape your creative decisions.
