# **Lesson 3, Step 9: Focus in Practice**

A perfectly composed photograph with exquisite lighting still falls flat when focus misses the mark. Your practice with stationary subjects—those coffee cup exercises—has trained your eye and hands in how your camera locks onto subjects. But what about when your subject darts across the frame or when you're shooting in near-darkness? Let's tackle two focusing challenges you'll face regularly.

## **Moving Subjects: Keeping Pace with Action**

When photographing movement, the challenge is capturing a sharp subject against a backdrop that may be either blurred or sharp, depending on your creative intention.

**Predictive Focus (AF-C/AI Servo)**: This focusing mode continually adjusts as your subject moves. Your camera predicts where the subject will be when the shutter fires, rather than where it was when you half-pressed the shutter button.

For successful predictive focus:

* Select a focus point that covers your subject  
* Keep the focus point on your subject as it moves  
* Maintain consistent tracking by following through with your camera movement

**Panning Technique:**

When you want a sharp subject with a motion-blurred background:

* Select a slightly slower shutter speed (1/60s-1/30s)  
* Track your subject's movement smoothly from left to right (or vice versa)  
* Continue your panning motion even after pressing the shutter

## **Low Light Focusing: Finding Detail in Darkness**

\[Image: Close-up of a camera's LCD screen showing focus peaking highlights on a dimly lit scene, with the actual scene visible in the background. Caption: "Focus peaking helps identify sharp areas in low-light conditions"\]

When light fades, autofocus hunts and struggles to lock onto subjects. Your camera needs contrast to find focus, and darkness steals that contrast away. Try these approaches:

**Focus on Contrast Points**

Look for these elements that still offer enough contrast for your camera to grab onto:

* Edges where light meets dark  
* Areas with text or patterns  
* Subjects' eyes (in portraits) as they usually have good contrast

**Manual Focus with Focus Peaking**

When autofocus fails completely:

* Switch to manual focus  
* Enable focus peaking (if available) which highlights in-focus edges  
* Use expanded/magnified view for precision  
* If your camera lacks these features, focus on the brightest available point, then recompose

## **Over to You**

**Moving Subject Challenge:** Share your experience photographing a moving subject. What focusing technique worked best for you? How did your choice of focus mode affect the final image? If you encountered difficulties, describe how you might adjust your approach next time.

**Low Light Focus Experiment:** Try photographing the same subject in low light using both autofocus and manual focus techniques. Which method produced better results for you? Did you discover any tricks that helped you achieve sharper focus in challenging conditions?
