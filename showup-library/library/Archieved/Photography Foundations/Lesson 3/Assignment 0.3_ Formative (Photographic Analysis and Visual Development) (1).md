# **Assignment 0.3: Formative (Photographic Analysis and Visual Development)**

In this assignment, you'll learn to look at and understand photographs in detail. You'll choose professional photographs that interest you, analyse how they were created and reflect on what you can learn from them for your own photography.

## **Task 1: Quiz**

**Learning Outcome:** LO1 \- Demonstrate baseline understanding of photographic principles

This quiz is designed to check your knowledge of the content presented and to help you to assess where you need further support.

## **Task 2: Professional Photography Analysis and Documentation**

**Learning Outcomes:**

* LO1 \- Demonstrate baseline understanding of photographic principles  
* LO5 \- Display professional awareness potential

2.1 Choose Your Photography Category. Pick ONE type of photography to focus on:

* Portraits (people)  
* Landscapes (nature/places)  
* Street photography (city life)  
* Still life (objects)

2.2 Find and Document Your Photographs. Find 5 professional photographs from your chosen category (you'll select 3 of these later for detailed analysis). For each photograph:

* Save it in your digital folder with the photographer's name and year  
* Record the photographer's name and background  
* Note where you found it using Harvard References  
* Explain why you chose this image and what makes it effective (100-150 words)

## **Task 3: Detailed Visual Analysis**

**Learning Outcomes:**

* LO2 \- Show basic technical awareness  
* LO4 \- Show understanding of creative process  
* LO5 \- Display professional awareness potential

3.1 Technical and Compositional Analysis:

Choose three photographs from your collection for detailed study. For each image, look at and write about:

3.1.1 How the photograph was made:

* Where does the light come from and what quality does it have? (Draw arrows to show direction)  
* What is the main thing that catches your eye first? (Mark this on the image)  
* How does the photographer guide your eye through the image? (Note any strong lines or patterns)

3.1.2 What the photograph communicates:

* How does the image make you feel? Think about the colours, arrangement, and subject.  
* What time of day/conditions helped create this image?  
* What choices did the photographer make to achieve this effect?

## **Task 4: Professional Development and Application**

**Learning Outcomes:**

* LO5 \- Display professional awareness potential  
* LO6 \- Demonstrate reflective practice potential

4.1 Visual Presentation Development:

Create a presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, or PDF format) that analyses your three selected photographs. For each photograph, include:

* What makes the image visually strong (consider composition, lighting, subject matter)  
* How similar techniques could be used in other photography situations  
* What technical decisions the photographer made (camera position, timing, equipment)  
* Questions you have about how specific effects were achieved

4.2 Learning Reflection:

Write about your learning journey (250 words) by answering these questions:

* What new things did you discover about photography by studying these professional images?  
* What surprised you most about your chosen type of photography?  
* Which part of analysing the photographs helped you learn the most?  
* How will you use what you learned in your own photography?

**Remember:** Throughout this assignment, focus on presentation and documentation. Image attributions must follow the format: Photographer Name, "Title" (if known), Year, Source/Publication using the Harvard System. Consult your tutor regarding approved resource platforms.

**Deliverables**

* **Task 1:** Completed Lesson 3 quiz results  
* A PDF and labelled ‘Assignment 0.3 \- Photographic Analysis and Visual Development’ with   
  * **Task 2:** Five photographs with photographer details, Harvard referenced sources and your written explanation for selecting each image (100-150 words per image)  
  * **Task 3:** Written and visual analysis of three selected photographs documenting how they were made and what they communicate  
  * **Task 4:** Professional presentation with your photograph analysis, learning journey reflection (250 words) and image credits
