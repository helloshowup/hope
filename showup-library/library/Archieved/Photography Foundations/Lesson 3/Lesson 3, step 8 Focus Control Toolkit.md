# **Lesson 3, step 8 Focus Control Toolkit**

Here's your Focus Control Toolkit\! We're looking at two everyday scenarios photographers face: portraits and landscapes. Getting comfortable with these basics will set you up for the trickier focusing situations we'll tackle later in the course.

This toolkit includes:

* Focus point selection guides for portraits  
* Focus point selection guides for landscapes

**How to use this toolkit:** Try these techniques out over several shooting sessions. Working with still subjects now helps you build the skills you'll need when we move on to moving subjects and tougher focusing challenges.

### **Portrait Focus Guide**

Where you place your focus point when photographing people can make or break your portrait:

| Subject Position | Recommended Focus Point | Why This Works |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Single subject, face forward | Center focus point on nearest eye | The eyes connect with viewers; sharp eyes are crucial |
| Profile view | Focus point on eye visible to camera | Maintains connection while respecting the composition |
| Group (same distance) | Focus point on center person's face | Gives you sharp faces when everyone's on the same plane |
| Group (staggered) | Focus on person closest to camera | Then adjust aperture to extend depth of field to cover others |

**Exercise:** Take 5 portrait photos using different focus points. Note which points worked best and why.

### **Landscape Focus Guide**

When shooting landscapes, these focus approaches tend to work well:

| Scene Type | Recommended Focus Point | Why This Works |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Standard landscape | Focus 1/3 into the scene | Maximizes depth of field coverage from foreground to background |
| Foreground interest | Focus directly on foreground element | Draws attention to the closest subject while maintaining scene context |
| Infinity focus | Focus on distant horizon | When foreground isn't important and you want background sharpness |
| Hyperfocal distance | Calculate based on focal length and aperture | Optimizes overall scene sharpness from foreground to infinity |

**Exercise:** Practice the 1/3 distance focusing technique in 3 different landscape scenes. Compare results with focusing at other distances.

## **Next Steps**

Now that you've got these portrait and landscape focusing techniques under your belt, you're ready for more challenging shots. Coming up, we'll see how to focus on moving subjects and work in tricky lighting. Keep practicing with these still subjects \- what you're learning now is the foundation for everything that follows.
