# **Lesson 3, Step 12: Photography Technical Skills Lesson Structure**

As you prepare for Assignment 0.3 (your required Photographic Analysis and Visual Development task), you might want some hands-on practice with the technical skills covered in Lesson 3\. This optional project offers a practical way to experiment with the exposure triangle, composition techniques, and focus control, helping you see how these elements work together rather than as isolated concepts.

While this project isn't mandatory, it's designed to help strengthen your technical skills through deliberate practice. If you're looking to build confidence before tackling Assignment 0.3, or simply want to challenge yourself, consider trying one or all of these technical exercises.

## **Project Overview**

This project challenges you to capture three distinct scenes, each showcasing a different technical approach:

* **Depth Control Scene** – Using aperture creatively to control what's in focus  
* **Motion Interpretation Scene** – Using shutter speed to either freeze or show movement  
* **Light Challenge Scene** – Working with difficult lighting conditions

For each scene, you'll apply the exposure principles, composition techniques, and focus methods you've learned, while using the problem-solving approach from Step 10\. This isn't about creating a large portfolio – it's about thoughtfully applying technical skills to achieve specific creative results.

## **Scene 1: Depth Control**

For this first scene, focus on using aperture creatively to control depth of field. You might photograph:

* A portrait where only the eyes are in sharp focus while the rest gradually blurs  
* A landscape where everything from foreground to horizon appears sharp  
* A detail shot where selective focus isolates one element among many

The key is making deliberate decisions about what stays sharp and what softens. Remember how aperture settings (f/1.8 vs. f/16) dramatically change which parts of your image remain in focus.

## **Scene 2: Motion Interpretation**

Your second scene should demonstrate shutter speed's creative potential. You could capture:

* A fast-moving subject frozen in time (think sports, wildlife, or even water droplets)  
* Intentional motion blur that conveys movement (flowing water, passing vehicles)  
* A combination where some elements freeze while others blur (panning technique)

Your technical choices should match your creative intention – whether that's showing precise detail in a split-second of action or conveying the feeling of movement through blur.

## **Scene 3: Light Challenge**

The final scene should demonstrate your ability to handle challenging lighting conditions:

* Backlighting where your subject appears against a bright background  
* High contrast scenes with both deep shadows and bright highlights  
* Low light situations requiring careful exposure choices  
* Mixed lighting with different light sources and colours

Drawing on what you learned in Step 10, this scene should show how you can maintain appropriate exposure, focus, and composition despite difficult lighting.

## **Documentation**

For each image, document:

* The technical settings you used (aperture, shutter speed, ISO)  
* The challenges you encountered and how you solved them  
* What worked well and what you might improve next time

This documentation helps you connect your technical decisions with the results you achieved, building a deeper understanding of how camera settings influence your images.

## **Planning Your Approach**

Before diving in, take time to plan each scene. Consider:

* What subjects might best demonstrate each technical concept  
* What locations offer appropriate conditions  
* When the light will be most suitable  
* What equipment you'll need

## **Helpful Resource: Scene-Specific Shooting Guide**

To help you successfully complete this project, here's a practical guide with key reminders for each scene type. You don't need to follow every point – just use this as a helpful reference while planning and shooting your images.

## **Appendix**

### **Depth Control Scene Tips**

**Before Shooting:**

* Scout a location with good distance between subject and background  
* Consider lens choice (longer focal lengths enhance background separation)  
* Plan your composition with a clear subject focus point  
* Set your camera to Aperture Priority (A/Av) or Manual mode

**During Shooting:**

* Set aperture first based on your creative vision:  
  * Wide aperture (f/1.8-f/4) for shallow depth of field  
  * Narrow aperture (f/11-f/16) for deep depth of field  
* Focus precisely on the most important element  
* Take test shots and check results at 100% magnification  
* Try multiple aperture settings for comparison  
* Keep your shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake (1/focal length or faster)

**Technical Reminders:**

* Subject distance affects depth of field (closer \= shallower)  
* Background distance affects separation (further \= more blur)  
* Check corners of frame for unwanted sharp elements

### **Motion Interpretation Scene Tips**

**Before Shooting:**

* Find a subject with appropriate movement speed  
* Determine the best angle to capture movement  
* Consider lighting needs for fast shutter speeds  
* Set your camera to Shutter Priority (S/Tv) or Manual mode

**During Shooting:**

* Set shutter speed first based on your creative vision:  
  * Fast action freeze: 1/500s or faster  
  * Moderate motion: 1/125s to 1/250s  
  * Intentional blur: 1/60s or slower  
* Anticipate subject movement and position yourself accordingly  
* For panning: practice smooth movement parallel to subject  
* Take multiple shots to ensure success  
* Check results and adjust as needed

**Technical Reminders:**

* Faster subjects need faster shutter speeds  
* Tripod essential for slow shutter speeds (unless using intentional camera movement)  
* Higher ISO may be needed for proper exposure with fast shutter speeds  
* For panning, continue your movement after pressing the shutter

### **Light Challenge Scene Tips**

**Before Shooting:**

* Identify the specific lighting challenge you want to tackle  
* Determine the best time of day/position for your chosen light condition  
* Consider using additional equipment if available (reflectors, diffusers)  
* Check your camera's metering mode (spot, centre-weighted, etc.)

**During Shooting:**

* Check your histogram to evaluate exposure  
* Apply exposure compensation as needed  
* Consider your camera's dynamic range limitations  
* Try bracketing exposures when necessary  
* Position your subject optimally relative to the light source

**Technical Reminders:**

* For backlit subjects: spot meter on the subject, typically \+1 to \+2 stops compensation  
* For high contrast: consider HDR techniques or graduated filters  
* For low light: balance ISO increase against noise tolerance  
* Check edges of frame for unwanted bright spots
