The complete video would include student interviews with subtitles and closed captions.*\n\n### Video Description\nThe video montage features interviews with diverse high school students sharing personal stories about how support from friends, family, and community helped them overcome challenges in their academic and personal lives.\n\n### Video Transcript Excerpt\n**Student 1:** \"When I was struggling with my advanced math class, my study group kept me going. We'd meet twice a week, and knowing they were counting on me helped me push through when I wanted to quit.\"\n\n**Student 2:** \"After my injury last season, I thought my athletic career was over. My teammates visited me during recovery and even modified practice so I could participate from the sidelines. Their support is why I'm back on the field today.\"\n\n**Student 3:** \"Moving to a new school sophomore year was overwhelming. The student ambassador program connected me with people who showed me around and included me at lunch. That small act of kindness made all the difference.\"\n\n## The Research: Why Community Matters\n\nStudies consistently demonstrate the power of social support in building resilience:\n\n- Students with strong peer relationships are 78% more likely to persevere through academic challenges.\n- Teenagers who identify at least one supportive adult in their lives show 56% higher resilience scores.\n- Group project completion rates increase by 34% when members report feeling supported by teammates.\n- High school students who participate in community organizations report 40% higher levels of grit and determination.\n\n## Activity: Mapping Your Support Network (20-25 minutes)\n\n### Instructions\n1. Open a new document in your preferred format (digital or paper).\n2. Draw or create yourself in the center.\n3. Create four sections around you labeled: Family, Friends, School, and Community.\n4. In each section, write the names of people who support you.\n5. Next to each name, note one specific way they provide support.\n6. Add a star next to the three people who most help you persevere during challenges.\n\n**Tip:** If you're using a digital format, consider using a mind-mapping tool or simple drawing program. If working on paper, you'll submit a photo or scan of your completed map.\n\n### Reflection Questions (Submit your responses in the text box below)\n- Who appears in multiple categories in your support network?\n- What patterns do you notice about the types of support that help you most?\n- Are there any gaps in your support network? How might you strengthen those areas?\n- How do you support others in their times of need?\n\n## Application: Strengthening Connections\n\nThis week, choose at least one of these actions to complete:\n\n1. **Reach Out**: Contact one person from your support map to express appreciation for their support.\n2. **Give Back**: Offer assistance to someone who might benefit from your support.\n3. **Expand Your Circle**: Identify one community organization or school club where you could build new supportive relationships.\n\n**Reflection Submission:** In 150-200 words, describe which action you chose, what you did, and what you learned from the experience. Submit this in the assignment area by the due date.\n\n## Key Takeaway\nBuilding resilience isn't just about individual strength\u2014it's about creating connections that help us all persevere together. Your support network is a resource you can actively strengthen and contribute to.\n\n## Discussion Board\nPost a response (250-300 words) to the following prompt: How has community support helped you overcome a challenge that you couldn't have managed alone?
