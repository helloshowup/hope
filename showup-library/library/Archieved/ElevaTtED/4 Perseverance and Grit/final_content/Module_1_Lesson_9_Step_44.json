When I began this course, I viewed challenges as obstacles to avoid rather than opportunities for growth. Through various experiences and deliberate practice of resilience strategies, I've developed a stronger sense of grit that has transformed not only my academic approach but also how I face personal challenges. The following reflections highlight key moments in this transformation.\n```\n\n## Writing Tips\n\n1. **Be authentic** - Share genuine experiences and emotions\n2. **Be specific** - Use concrete examples rather than generalizations\n3. **Show growth** - Emphasize how your thinking has changed\n4. **Connect to concepts** - Reference specific ideas about perseverance and grit\n5. **Be forward-looking** - Demonstrate how you'll apply these skills\n\n## Self-Check Questions Before Submitting\n\n- Have I clearly shown how my understanding of perseverance has changed?\n- Did I include specific examples with details about challenges I faced?\n- Have I explained what strategies helped me persevere?\n- Does my letter connect my experiences to concepts we learned?\n- Have I set clear goals for how I'll apply these skills in the future?\n\nRemember, your reflective letter should demonstrate both your understanding of perseverance concepts and your ability to apply them to your own life. This letter serves as evidence of your growth mindset and commitment to continued personal development.",
