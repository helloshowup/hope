This lesson will guide you through interpreting your score and identifying practical areas for growth.\n\n## Understanding the Grit Scale Graph\n\n### Video Walkthrough: Interpreting Your Grit Score\n[Video: Interpreting Your Grit Score - 4:30]\n\nIn this video, you'll learn:\n- How to read your overall grit score (on a scale of 1-5)\n- What different score ranges indicate about your current grit level:\n  - 1.0-2.5: Developing grit (opportunity for significant growth)\n  - 2.6-3.5: Moderate grit (some strengths with room for improvement)\n  - 3.6-4.5: Strong grit (solid foundation with specific areas to enhance)\n  - 4.6-5.0: Exceptional grit (highly developed perseverance skills)\n- How to understand your subscores:\n  - Consistency of interest (passion): How you maintain focus on long-term goals\n  - Perseverance of effort (persistence): How you handle setbacks and challenges\n- Real student examples showing how grit scores relate to academic success\n\n## Score Interpretation Activity\n\n### Personal Reflection and Application\n**TASK:** Take 10-15 minutes to record your scores and reflect on what they mean for your learning journey:\n\n1. **My Overall Grit Score**: _______ (out of 5)\n2. **My Consistency of Interest Score**: _______ (out of 5)\n3. **My Perseverance of Effort Score**: _______ (out of 5)\n\n### Guided Reflection Questions\nAnswer these questions in your digital notebook or download the worksheet from the Resources section:\n\n- Which aspect of grit is currently your strength? Provide a specific example from your coursework or personal life that demonstrates this strength.\n- Which area shows the most opportunity for growth? How might improving in this area help you succeed in your Excel High School courses?\n- Think of a recent academic challenge you faced. How do your grit scores align with how you handled that situation?\n- What surprised you most about your results? Why?\n\n## Personalized Next Steps\n\nBased on your score range, here are recommended actions to build your grit:\n\n**If your overall score is 1.0-2.5:**\n- Set small, achievable goals for your daily coursework (Example: \"I will complete one lesson module before taking a break\")\n- Use the BRYTE AI Tutor when you encounter difficult concepts instead of giving up\n- Schedule weekly check-ins with your Success Coach to build accountability\n\n**If your overall score is 2.6-3.5:**\n- Identify specific situations in your courses where your persistence tends to falter\n- Create a \"grit journal\" to track when and why you feel like giving up on challenging assignments\n- Set up calendar reminders with motivational messages tied to your long-term academic goals\n\n**If your overall score is 3.6-5.0:**\n- Challenge yourself with honors options in your courses\n- Create a study group in the Student Portal to help peers develop their own grit\n- Apply your perseverance skills to areas outside academics (volunteering, hobbies, etc.)\n\n## Application: My Grit Development Plan\n\nCreate a simple two-week plan to strengthen your grit using the template below:\n\n1. One specific grit-building action I will take this week: _________________\n2. How I'll measure my progress: _________________\n3. Potential obstacles and how I'll overcome them: _________________\n4. Who can support me in this effort: _________________\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Remember that your grit score is not fixed!
