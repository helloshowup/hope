  "edit_summary": "I made several strategic improvements to enhance the educational effectiveness of the Resilience Techniques Toolkit:\n\n1. Added Excel High School context throughout to make the content more relevant and specific to the target learners.\n\n2. Included \"Excel Student Tips\" for each technique to provide practical application examples directly related to their online learning experience.\n\n3. Added a fourth technique focused on \"Connection & Support\" that specifically references Excel's support resources (Success Coach Pro, BRYTE AI Tutor, Writing Lab, Parent Portal) to address the potential isolation of online learning.\n\n4. Improved navigation by adding a link to an interactive version in the Student Portal, supporting the digital-first nature of Excel High School.\n\n5. Enhanced the content to better address the \"Second-Chance Learners\" segment mentioned in the learner profile by emphasizing resilience scaffolds and small wins.\n\nThese changes align the toolkit more closely with Excel's instructional design drivers, particularly \"Self-Direction Aids,\" \"Flexibility WITH Structure,\" and \"Community & Presence.\""
