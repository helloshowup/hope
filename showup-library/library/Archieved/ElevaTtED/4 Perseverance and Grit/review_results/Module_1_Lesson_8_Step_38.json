This journal exercise will help you identify both your strengths and areas for improvement in demonstrating grit.\n\n## Journal Prompt\nTake a few moments to reflect on your recent experiences where perseverance was required. This could be in academics, personal projects, sports, or any challenging situation. In 150-200 words, note:\n\n1. **One strength** you demonstrated related to grit and perseverance\n2. **One gap** or area where you could improve your perseverance\n\nBe specific and provide examples. Consider how these strengths and gaps have affected your ability to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.\n\n## Sample Response Format\n\n**My Grit Strength:**  \nI demonstrate strong perseverance when working on long-term projects that interest me. For example, when preparing for my history presentation last month, I spent three weeks researching, organizing information, and practicing my delivery even when I encountered conflicting information that required me to revise my work multiple times. I didn't give up when I had to restart sections of my presentation, and I maintained my enthusiasm throughout the process because I was genuinely interested in the topic. This strength helps me produce quality work and see projects through to completion when I care deeply about them.\n\n**My Grit Gap:**  \nI struggle to maintain perseverance when facing tasks that don't immediately interest me or when I don't see immediate progress. For instance, when practicing math problems that I find difficult, I tend to get frustrated after 10-15 minutes and want to quit. I also notice I give up more easily when I receive criticism on my work, taking it personally rather than seeing it as an opportunity to improve. This gap prevents me from developing skills in areas outside my comfort zone and limits my growth potential.\n\n## Reflection Questions for Depth\n\nAfter completing your journal entry, consider these questions to deepen your understanding:\n\n1. **Root Analysis:** What factors contribute to your identified strength? What specific behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs help you persevere in those situations?\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:** In what types of situations do you consistently demonstrate grit? In what situations do you typically struggle with perseverance?\n\n3. **Impact Assessment:** How has your strength in perseverance positively affected your achievements? How has your gap limited your progress or opportunities?\n\n4. **Connection Exploration:** Is there a relationship between your strength and gap? Could your strength in one area be adapted to help address your gap?\n\n5. **Growth Planning:** What specific, small step could you take this week to begin addressing your identified gap in perseverance?\n\n6. **Support Identification:** Who in your life models the perseverance qualities you want to develop? How might you learn from them?\n\n## Applying Your Insights\n\nChoose one of the following options to apply what you've learned:\n\n**Option 1: Create a Grit Strategy**\nDevelop a 3-step plan to apply your perseverance strength to an upcoming challenge in an area where you typically struggle. What specific techniques from your strength area can you transfer?\n\n**Option 2: Perseverance Tracker**\nFor the next week, keep a brief daily log of moments when you either persisted through difficulty or gave up. Note what factors influenced your response in each situation.\n\n**Option 3: Inspiration Board**\nCreate a digital or physical collection of quotes, images, or examples that inspire you to persevere. Include at least one personal success story where you demonstrated grit.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis journal exercise is not just about identifying your current state but building awareness that can lead to growth. By recognizing both your strengths and gaps in perseverance, you create a foundation for intentional development of your grit. Remember that perseverance, like any quality, can be strengthened through practice and conscious effort.\n\nReturn to this journal periodically to track your progress and update your understanding of your perseverance profile.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n* Your journal entry should be 150-200 words total (covering both your strength and gap)\n* Include specific examples from your own experiences\n* If you choose to complete one of the application options, include this with your submission\n* Submit your completed journal through the assignment portal by the due date",
