  "edit_summary": "I made several targeted improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and support for Excel High School's diverse learner segments:\n\n1. Added specific word count guidelines for the closing reflection (50-75 words) and peer responses (75-100 words) to provide clearer structure.\n\n2. Included a practical tip about setting calendar reminders to help students with time management, which addresses the \"Self-Direction Aids\" instructional design driver.\n\n3. Modified the closing reflection prompt to specifically ask for \"strategies or mindsets\" they'll take forward, making the reflection more concrete and actionable.\n\n4. Added a \"Need Help?\" section at the end that references Excel High School's BRYTE AI Tutor and Success Coach support, which acknowledges the available resources for students who might need additional assistance.\n\nThese changes maintain the educational value of the original content while providing more structure and support, particularly beneficial for \"Second-Chance Learners\" and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who may need additional scaffolding and clear expectations."
