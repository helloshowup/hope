When we face challenges, having people to lean on can make all the difference in our ability to persist. This activity will help you visualize and appreciate your personal support system through a digital mapping exercise.\n\n## Learning Objective\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will create a visual representation of your support network that identifies key people who help you persevere through challenges.\n\n## Materials Needed\n\n- Computer or tablet with internet access\n- Access to a digital diagram tool (recommended options: Lucidchart, Canva, Google Drawings, or MindMeister)\n- Alternative option: If you prefer a non-digital approach, you may use paper and colored markers/pencils\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Choose Your Digital Tool (5 minutes)\nSelect a digital diagram tool that you're comfortable using. Many free options are available online. Choose one that allows you to create shapes, add text, and use different colors.\n\n**Quick-Start Tips:**\n- Lucidchart: Use the \"Mind Map\" template\n- Canva: Search for \"Mind Map\" or \"Network Diagram\" templates\n- Google Drawings: Start with a blank canvas and use shapes/text boxes\n- MindMeister: Use the basic mind map template\n\n### Step 2: Create Support Categories (5-10 minutes)\nIn your chosen digital tool, create three main categories to organize your support network:\n- **Family Support**: Parents, siblings, grandparents, or other family members\n- **Peer Support**: Friends, classmates, teammates\n- **Mentor Support**: Teachers, coaches, counselors, or other adult guides\n\n**Note:** Feel free to add or modify these categories to better reflect your personal support system.\n\n### Step 3: Add Individual Connections (10-15 minutes)\nWithin each category, add the names of specific people who support you. For each person, add a brief note about how they help you persevere, such as:\n- \"Listens when I'm frustrated\"\n- \"Gives me honest feedback\"\n- \"Believes in me\"\n- \"Helps me with specific challenges\"\n- \"Provides motivation when I need it\"\n\n### Step 4: Color Code Your Connections (5-10 minutes)\nDevelop a color-coding system to represent different types of support:\n- Use one color for emotional support (people who encourage you)\n- Use another color for practical support (people who help with specific tasks)\n- Use a third color for inspirational support (people who model perseverance)\n\nYou can indicate these connections using colored lines, text boxes, or background colors.\n\n### Step 5: Reflect on Your Support Map (10 minutes)\nAfter completing your diagram, answer these reflection questions in a text box on your map or in a separate document:\n1. What patterns do you notice in your support network?\n2. Are there any gaps in your support system? If so, how might you address them?\n3. How can you better utilize these supports when facing challenges?\n4. Which person in your network has been most helpful during difficult times, and why?\n\n### Step 6: Save and Upload\nTake a screenshot of your completed support map and upload it to your portfolio. Make sure your name is visible somewhere on the diagram.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n- Your support map should include at least 5-7 people across different categories\n- Each person should have at least one note about how they provide support\n- Your color-coding system should be clearly explained\n- Reflection questions should be thoughtfully answered\n\n## Extension Activities (Optional)\n- Create a second diagram showing how you provide support to others in your life\n- Identify one person not currently in your support network whom you could reach out to\n- Write a brief thank-you note to someone in your support network\n\n## Time Management\nTotal estimated time: 35-50 minutes\n- If you're short on time, focus on completing Steps 1-4 and at least two reflection questions\n\nRemember: Building and maintaining support networks is an ongoing process that strengthens your ability to persevere!",
