  "reviewed_content": "# Goal-Clarity Rubric\n\n## Overview\nThe Goal-Clarity Rubric is an AI-powered tool designed to evaluate your academic goals and provide immediate feedback on their effectiveness. This rubric analyzes three critical components of your goals:\n\n1. **Specificity**: How clearly defined is your goal? (Example: \"Complete Algebra 1 with a B+ or higher\" vs. \"Do better in math\")\n2. **Measurability**: Can progress toward your goal be tracked and measured? (Example: \"Read 20 pages daily\" vs. \"Read more\")\n3. **Timeline**: Does your goal include a realistic deadline? (Example: \"Submit all Unit 3 assignments by Friday\" vs. \"Finish soon\")\n\n## How It Works\n1. Submit your academic goal in the provided text box\n2. The AI evaluates your goal against the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)\n3. Receive an instant score and specific feedback\n4. If your score falls below mastery level (80%), you'll receive suggestions and a link to revise and resubmit your goal\n\n## Benefits for Excel High School Students\n- Develop stronger self-direction skills essential for asynchronous learning\n- Create more effective academic targets that support sustained effort\n- Practice a valuable skill that applies to both academic and career success\n- Receive immediate feedback to improve your goal-setting approach\n\n**Pro Tip:** Before submitting, ask yourself: \"Would someone else know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish, how I'll measure success, and when I plan to achieve it?\"",
  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve clarity, engagement, and educational value:\n\n1. Added concrete examples for each component (specificity, measurability, timeline) to help students understand the abstract concepts\n2. Expanded the SMART acronym to provide complete information\n3. Added a \"Benefits\" section that connects goal-setting to asynchronous learning success and makes the value more explicit\n4. Included a \"Pro Tip\" that gives students a practical self-check strategy\n5. Improved the explanation of the feedback process by mentioning that suggestions will be provided\n6. Enhanced overall formatting with more white space and clearer organization\n\nThese changes make the content more actionable, relevant to Excel High School students' needs, and supportive of self-directed learning skills that are crucial in an asynchronous environment."
