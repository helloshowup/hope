Select two perseverance stories we've studied (or choose from the provided options).\n\n2. Complete this planning template:\n   - Main comparison focus: _________________\n   - Subject 1 key points: _________________\n   - Subject 2 key points: _________________\n   - Most significant similarities: _________________\n   - Most significant differences: _________________\n\n3. Draft your 120-150 word comparative analysis following the outlined structure.\n\n4. Review your draft using the concise writing tips checklist.\n\n5. Exchange with a partner for feedback on clarity and conciseness.\n   - **Note**: As an online student, you can submit your draft to the Writing Lab for feedback, or use the BRYTE AI Tutor for immediate guidance.\n\n## Example Starter\n\nHere's how you might begin a comparative analysis of two athletes' perseverance stories:\n\n```\nBoth Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps and gymnast Simone Biles overcame significant obstacles through extraordinary perseverance, though their motivations and strategies differed notably.
