What's the best way to offer support?\n\nA) Tell Alex to just relax and not worry so much\nB) Invite Alex to join a small study session and offer specific help\nC) Avoid mentioning exams around Alex to reduce stress\nD) Send Alex links to stress management articles\n\n**Answer: B** - Inviting Alex to a small study session provides practical help while rebuilding community connections.

What's the most effective approach?\n\nA) Take over leadership and assign specific tasks to everyone\nB) Suggest the team meet to openly discuss challenges and reset expectations\nC) Work harder on your part to compensate for others\nD) Report the problems to your teacher immediately\n\n**Answer: B** - Facilitating an open discussion allows the team to address issues collaboratively, rebuild trust, and create shared solutions. This community-based approach strengthens collective perseverance rather than creating division or dependency.\n\n## Scenario 3: The Discouraged Friend\nYour friend Jamie failed an important test and says, \"I'm just not smart enough for this class. I should drop out.\" What's the best response?\n\nA) Agree that the class might be too difficult\nB) Say \"Don't be silly, you're really smart!\"\nC) Share a time you struggled but improved with practice, and offer to study together\nD) Suggest Jamie talk to the teacher about extra credit\n\n**Answer: C** - Sharing your own struggle normalizes difficulty, demonstrates growth mindset, and offers practical community support. This approach builds connection while encouraging perseverance through challenges.\n\n## Reflection\nThink about a time when you faced an academic challenge. Which support strategies helped you the most? How might you apply what you've learned in this quiz to help build a stronger learning community at Excel High School?",
