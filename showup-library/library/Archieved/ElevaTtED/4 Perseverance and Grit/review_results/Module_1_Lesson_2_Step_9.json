How does grit predict success differently than IQ or talent?\n2. How might this concept apply to your own educational journey at Excel High School?\n\n## Blog Post Structure (20 minutes)\nReview the components of an effective motivational blog post:\n\n1. **Engaging Hook**: Start with a compelling question, surprising statistic, or relatable story\n2. **Main Content**: Include research-backed information about perseverance and grit\n3. **Personal Connection**: Relate the topic to readers' lives and experiences\n4. **Call-to-Action**: End with a specific, actionable suggestion for readers\n\n**Interactive Activity**: Examine the sample blog post provided below and identify each component in the comment boxes.\n\n## Research Component (15 minutes)\nResearch one study on perseverance/grit using these starter resources:\n- Angela Duckworth's research on grit (link provided)\n- Carol Dweck's studies on growth mindset (link provided)\n- Studies on resilience in athletics and academics (link provided)\n\n**Checkpoint**: Submit your chosen research study and briefly explain (2-3 sentences) how you plan to incorporate it into your blog post.\n\n## Writing Workshop (30 minutes)\nDraft your 250-word blog post following these guidelines:\n\n1. Create an engaging hook that captures attention\n2. Explain why perseverance and grit matter using clear examples\n3. Cite at least one research study to support claims\n4. Connect the concepts to readers' everyday lives\n5. End with a specific call-to-action\n\n**Time Management Tip**: Allocate approximately:\n- 5 minutes for planning\n- 20 minutes for writing\n- 5 minutes for initial self-review\n\n## Editorial Checklist (10 minutes)\nReview your work using this checklist:\n\n- [ ] Is my blog post approximately 250 words?\n- [ ] Does my hook grab attention in the first sentence?\n- [ ] Have I cited at least one research study correctly?\n- [ ] Is my tone positive and motivational?\n- [ ] Does my call-to-action give readers a specific next step?\n- [ ] Have I used clear, concise language without jargon?\n- [ ] Is my blog post free of grammatical and spelling errors?\n\n## Peer Review (Optional Extension)\nFor students interested in feedback before final submission, post your draft in the \"Peer Review Forum\" where you can exchange constructive feedback with classmates.\n\n## Sample Blog Post\n\n**The Power of Not Giving Up**\n\nHave you ever felt like throwing in the towel when faced with a challenge? You're not alone. The difference between those who succeed and those who don't often comes down to one quality: grit.\n\nPsychologist Angela Duckworth's groundbreaking research found that grit\u2014the combination of passion and perseverance\u2014is a stronger predictor of success than IQ or talent. In her study of West Point cadets, National Spelling Bee contestants, and sales professionals, Duckworth discovered that grittier individuals were significantly more likely to achieve their goals.\n\nThis matters for your academic journey. When you encounter a difficult math problem or struggle with a complex essay, your ability to persist through frustration determines your outcome. Grit isn't about never failing; it's about getting back up every time you do.\n\nThe good news? Grit can be developed. Start by identifying a meaningful goal and breaking it into smaller milestones. Celebrate progress, but focus on the process rather than just results. When obstacles arise\u2014and they will\u2014view them as opportunities to grow stronger.\n\nToday, choose one challenge you've been avoiding and commit to working on it for just 15 minutes. Small, consistent efforts build the perseverance muscle that will carry you through life's biggest challenges.\n\nWhat will you not give up on today?\n\n## Assessment\nSubmit your final 250-word blog post for evaluation based on:\n- Adherence to the 250-word guideline\n- Inclusion of an engaging hook\n- Proper citation of at least one study\n- Effective call-to-action\n- Overall persuasiveness and motivational tone\n\n## Extension Activities (Choose One)\n- Create a visual companion piece (infographic or social media post) that highlights the key message from your blog post\n- Record a 1-minute audio version of your blog post as a podcast intro\n- Apply the concepts of grit to a specific challenge in your current coursework at Excel High School",
