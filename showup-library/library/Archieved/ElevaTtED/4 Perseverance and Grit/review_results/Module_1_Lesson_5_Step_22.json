When facing challenging assignments or feeling overwhelmed with coursework at Excel High School, this simple technique can help you refocus your mind and reduce stress.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n- Apply a structured breathing technique to manage academic stress\n- Recognize how breathing affects your body's stress response\n- Identify specific academic situations where this technique would be beneficial\n\n## Video Tutorial: Guided Breathing Exercise\n\n[Video begins with instructor seated in a calm environment]\n\n**Instructor:** \"Hello, Excel High School students. Today I'm going to guide you through a simple breathing exercise that you can use whenever you feel stressed about assignments or tests. This technique helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body's stress response.\"\n\n**Instructor demonstrates proper posture:** \"Start by sitting comfortably with your feet flat on the floor. Rest your hands on your lap or on your knees. Straighten your back slightly, but stay relaxed.\"\n\n[On-screen timer appears showing 5:00 minutes with visual breathing guide animation]\n\n**Instructor:** \"We'll begin with a few deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of two, and exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let me demonstrate first.\"\n\n[Instructor demonstrates the breathing pattern as the timer counts down]\n\n**Instructor:** \"Now I'd like you to join me. Inhale through your nose for 1-2-3-4, hold for 1-2, and exhale through your mouth for 1-2-3-4-5-6.\"\n\n[Timer shows 4:00 minutes remaining]\n\n**Instructor:** \"I'll pause now so you can practice on your own for the next minute. Follow the on-screen timer and continue the pattern: inhale for 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6. If your mind wanders to school deadlines or other concerns, gently bring your focus back to your breath.\"\n\n[Video pauses for student participation with timer continuing to count down and breathing animation]\n\n[Timer shows 3:00 minutes remaining]\n\n**Instructor returns:** \"Great job. Now let's try a different pattern. Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. This balanced breathing helps create mental clarity when you're working on difficult problems or preparing for exams.\"\n\n[Instructor demonstrates, then pauses again for student practice]\n\n[Timer shows 1:00 minute remaining]\n\n**Instructor:** \"For this final minute, breathe naturally and notice how your body feels. Pay attention to any areas where tension has released. This awareness will help you recognize when to use this technique during your studies.\"\n\n[Timer reaches 0:00]\n\n**Instructor:** \"Well done. This simple practice can be used anytime you feel overwhelmed with your coursework. Try it before starting a challenging assignment, during study breaks, or right before taking a test. Regular practice strengthens your ability to self-regulate during academic challenges.\"\n\n## Application to Your Learning\n\nBefore moving to the reflection questions, consider these specific scenarios where this breathing technique could help you:\n\n- When you feel stuck on a difficult math problem\n- Before beginning a timed assessment\n- When feeling overwhelmed by a writing assignment\n- During study breaks to refresh your focus\n- When balancing multiple course deadlines\n\n## Reflection\n\n[Text box appears on screen with the following prompt:]\n\n**Please take a moment to reflect on your experience by answering these questions:**\n\n1.
