# Record a 60-sec Mindset PSA

## Project Overview
In this activity, you'll create a short 60-second Public Service Announcement (PSA) about growth mindset to share with your peers. This video will allow you to apply what you've learned about how adopting a growth mindset fosters perseverance in different learning situations.

## Your PSA Checklist

### Content Requirements
Your 60-second PSA must include:

1. **Hook Statement** - Start with an attention-grabbing statement that makes viewers want to listen. This could be a surprising fact, a thought-provoking question, or a bold statement about mindset.

2. **Brief Personal Story** - Share a short example from your own life where you demonstrated (or needed) a growth mindset. This makes your message authentic and relatable.

3. **One Actionable Tip** - Provide one specific, practical strategy that viewers can use to develop their growth mindset. Make sure it's something they can start doing right away.

### Technical Guidelines

**Recording Instructions:**
- Use your smartphone to record your PSA
- Find a quiet location with good lighting
- Position your phone horizontally (landscape mode)
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Keep your video exactly 60 seconds (practice timing beforehand)
- Check that your audio is clear and background noise is minimal

**Upload Instructions:**
1. Save your video file with the naming format: "LastName_FirstName_MindsetPSA"
2. Upload your completed video to the designated submission area in the course
3. Include a brief caption (1-2 sentences) that summarizes your PSA's main message

## Example PSA Outline

Here's a sample structure to help you plan your PSA:

**0:00-0:10** - Hook statement to grab attention
> "Did you know that your brain physically changes every time you learn something new? That's right - your intelligence isn't fixed; it grows!"

**0:10-0:30** - Brief personal story
> "Last year, I struggled with algebra and thought I just wasn't a 'math person.' Instead of giving up, I started saying 'I can't do this YET' and broke problems into smaller steps. After two months of consistent effort, I improved from a D to a B+."

**0:30-0:50** - One actionable tip with explanation
> "My tip for developing your growth mindset is to change your self-talk. When you catch yourself thinking 'I can't do this,' add the word 'yet' to the end. This simple word transforms a fixed mindset statement into a growth mindset opportunity."

**0:50-1:00** - Closing statement
> "Remember, your abilities aren't set in stone. With effort and the right strategies, you can grow your skills in any area. What will you add 'yet' to today?"

## Evaluation Criteria
Your PSA will be evaluated on:
- Inclusion of all required elements (hook, personal story, actionable tip)
- Clear communication of growth mindset principles
- Adherence to the 60-second time limit
- Technical quality (audio clarity, appropriate lighting)
