When we face challenges, having people to lean on can make all the difference in our ability to persist. This activity will help you visualize and appreciate your personal support system through a digital mapping exercise.\n\n## Learning Objective\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will create a visual representation of your support network that identifies key people who help you persevere through challenges.\n\n## Materials Needed\n\n- Computer or tablet with internet access\n- Access to a digital diagram tool (recommended options: Lucidchart, Canva, Google Drawings, or MindMeister)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Choose Your Digital Tool\nSelect a digital diagram tool that you're comfortable using. Many free options are available online. Choose one that allows you to create shapes, add text, and use different colors.\n\n### Step 2: Create Support Categories\nIn your chosen digital tool, create three main categories to organize your support network:\n- **Family Support**: Parents, siblings, grandparents, or other family members\n- **Peer Support**: Friends, classmates, teammates\n- **Mentor Support**: Teachers, coaches, counselors, or other adult guides\n\n### Step 3: Add Individual Connections\nWithin each category, add the names of specific people who support you. For each person, you might want to add a brief note about how they help you persevere (e.g., \"Listens when I'm frustrated,\" \"Gives me honest feedback,\" \"Believes in me\").\n\n### Step 4: Color Code Your Connections\nDevelop a color-coding system to represent different types of support:\n- Use one color for emotional support (people who encourage you)\n- Use another color for practical support (people who help with specific tasks)\n- Use a third color for inspirational support (people who model perseverance)\n\nYou can indicate these connections using colored lines, text boxes, or background colors.\n\n### Step 5: Reflect on Your Support Map\nAfter completing your diagram, take a moment to reflect:\n- What patterns do you notice?\n- Are there any gaps in your support system?\n- How can you better utilize these supports when facing challenges?\n\n### Step 6: Save and Upload\nTake a screenshot of your completed support map and upload it to your portfolio. Make sure your name is visible somewhere on the diagram.\n\n## Extension Activity\nConsider how you serve as support for others. Create a second diagram showing how you provide support to people in your life and how you might strengthen these connections.\n\nRemember: Building and maintaining support networks is an ongoing process that strengthens your ability to persevere!",
