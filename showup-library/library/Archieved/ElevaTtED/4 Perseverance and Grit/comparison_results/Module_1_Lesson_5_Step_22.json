Today I'm going to guide you through a simple breathing exercise that you can use whenever you feel stressed about assignments or tests. This technique helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body's stress response.\"\n\n**Instructor demonstrates proper posture:** \"Start by sitting comfortably with your feet flat on the floor. Rest your hands on your lap or on your knees. Straighten your back slightly, but stay relaxed.\"\n\n[On-screen timer appears showing 5:00 minutes]\n\n**Instructor:** \"We'll begin with a few deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of two, and exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let me demonstrate first.\"\n\n[Instructor demonstrates the breathing pattern as the timer counts down]\n\n**Instructor:** \"Now I'd like you to join me. Inhale through your nose for 1-2-3-4, hold for 1-2, and exhale through your mouth for 1-2-3-4-5-6.\"\n\n[Timer shows 4:00 minutes remaining]\n\n**Instructor:** \"I'll pause now so you can practice on your own for the next minute. Follow the on-screen timer and continue the pattern: inhale for 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6.\"\n\n[Video pauses for student participation with timer continuing to count down]\n\n[Timer shows 3:00 minutes remaining]\n\n**Instructor returns:** \"Great job. Now let's try a different pattern. Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. This balanced breathing helps create mental clarity when you're working on difficult problems.\"\n\n[Instructor demonstrates, then pauses again for student practice]\n\n[Timer shows 1:00 minute remaining]\n\n**Instructor:** \"For this final minute, breathe naturally and notice how your body feels.
