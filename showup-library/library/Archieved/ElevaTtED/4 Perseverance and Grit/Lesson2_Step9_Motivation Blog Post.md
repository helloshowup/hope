# Motivation Blog Post Lesson: Perseverance and Grit

## Learning Objective
Students will create a persuasive blog post about the importance of perseverance and grit for academic and personal success.

## Introduction (15 minutes)
Begin by asking students to reflect on a time when they wanted to give up on something but pushed through instead. Have students respond in the discussion forum, sharing their experiences and what motivated them to continue.

Introduce the concepts of perseverance and grit:
- **Perseverance**: Steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success
- **Grit**: Passion and perseverance for long-term goals (Angela Duckworth's definition)

Watch Angela Duckworth's TED Talk clip on grit (first 3 minutes) and respond to these reflection questions:
1. How does grit predict success differently than IQ or talent?
2. How might this concept apply to your own educational journey at Excel High School?

## Blog Post Structure (20 minutes)
Review the components of an effective motivational blog post:

1. **Engaging Hook**: Start with a compelling question, surprising statistic, or relatable story
2. **Main Content**: Include research-backed information about perseverance and grit
3. **Personal Connection**: Relate the topic to readers' lives and experiences
4. **Call-to-Action**: End with a specific, actionable suggestion for readers

**Interactive Activity**: Examine the sample blog post provided below and identify each component in the comment boxes.

**The Power of Not Giving Up**

Have you ever felt like throwing in the towel when faced with a challenge? You're not alone. The difference between those who succeed and those who don't often comes down to one quality: grit.

Psychologist Angela Duckworth's groundbreaking research found that grit—the combination of passion and perseverance—is a stronger predictor of success than IQ or talent. In her study of West Point cadets, National Spelling Bee contestants, and sales professionals, Duckworth discovered that grittier individuals were significantly more likely to achieve their goals.

This matters for your academic journey. When you encounter a difficult math problem or struggle with a complex essay, your ability to persist through frustration determines your outcome. Grit isn't about never failing; it's about getting back up every time you do.

The good news? Grit can be developed. Start by identifying a meaningful goal and breaking it into smaller milestones. Celebrate progress, but focus on the process rather than just results. When obstacles arise—and they will—view them as opportunities to grow stronger.

Today, choose one challenge you've been avoiding and commit to working on it for just 15 minutes. Small, consistent efforts build the perseverance muscle that will carry you through life's biggest challenges.

What will you not give up on today?
