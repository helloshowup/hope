    "<educational_content>\n# Offer Help Forum\n\n## Forum Instructions\n\nWelcome to our Offer Help Forum! This is a space where we can support each other's learning journey by sharing our strengths and areas where we could use assistance.\n\n### Your Task:\n\n1. **Share one skill you can offer to help others with**\n   * What's something you're good at that might benefit your classmates?\n   * This could be academic (like math or writing) or non-academic (like time management or study techniques)\n\n2. **Share one area where you could use some help**\n   * What's something you're finding challenging right now?\n   * Be specific so others know exactly how they might assist you\n\n3. **Use supportive language in your post**\n   * Be honest but positive about both your strengths and challenges\n   * Phrase your offer to help in a welcoming way\n   * Express your need for help in a constructive manner\n\n4. **Reply to at least two classmates**\n   * Offer specific help to someone if you can address their need\n   * Thank someone who offers a skill that could help you\n   * Ask clarifying questions if needed\n   * Be encouraging and supportive in all interactions\n\n### Example Post:\n\n\"I can offer help with essay organization and outlining - I've always found it easy to structure my thoughts on paper. I could use some help with math word problems, especially when they involve multiple steps. I tend to miss important details when reading through them.\"\n\nRemember, we all have different strengths and challenges. By supporting each other, we build a stronger learning community and develop perseverance together!\n\nYour initial post is due by [date], and your two replies are due by [date].\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Offer Help Forum\n\n## Forum Instructions\n\nWelcome to our Offer Help Forum! This is a space where we can support each other's learning journey by sharing our strengths and areas where we could use assistance.\n\n### Your Task:\n1. Create a post that includes:\n   - One skill you feel confident in and could help others with\n   - One area where you would appreciate help from classmates\n   - Be specific about both so others can provide meaningful support\n\n2. Use supportive language in your post:\n   - Phrase your offer to help in an approachable way (Example: \"I'm pretty good at time management and would be happy to share some strategies that work for me.\")\n   - Frame your request for help as a learning opportunity rather than a deficiency (Example: \"I'm looking to improve my note-taking skills and would appreciate any tips.\")\n   - Be honest but positive about your abilities and challenges\n\n3. Reply to at least two classmates:\n   - Offer specific, constructive suggestions to those seeking help in areas where you have skills\n   - Express appreciation for offers that might help with your own areas of need\n   - Ask clarifying questions if needed to better understand how you might help or be helped\n\nRemember that everyone has different strengths and areas for growth. By supporting each other, we build a stronger learning community and develop collective perseverance!\n\nYour initial post is due by [date], and your two replies by [date].\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Offer Help Forum\n\n## Discussion Prompt\n\nWelcome to our Offer Help Forum! This space is designed for us to support each other in our learning journey at Excel High School. Everyone has unique strengths and areas where they could use assistance. By sharing both, we create a community of mutual support and growth.\n\n### Your Task:\n1. **Share one skill you can offer help with** to other students. This could be an academic subject, study technique, technology skill, or any other area where you feel confident.\n\n2. **Identify one area where you would appreciate help** from classmates. Be specific about what type of support would be most beneficial.\n\n3. **Reply thoughtfully to at least two classmates** during this unit. In your replies, either offer specific guidance if you can help with their request, or acknowledge their offer to help if it's in an area you're struggling with.\n\n### Guidelines for Supportive Communication:\n* Use encouraging language (e.g., \"I believe you can master this\" rather than \"This is easy\")\n* Be specific with your offers of help (e.g., \"I can help explain quadratic equations\" rather than \"I'm good at math\")\n* Ask clarifying questions when needed\n* Acknowledge the effort others are making\n* Share strategies that have worked for you personally\n\nRemember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. By practicing offering and requesting assistance, we build a community that supports everyone's success.\n\nWhat's one way you can help others, and what's one area where you could use support?\n</educational_content>"
