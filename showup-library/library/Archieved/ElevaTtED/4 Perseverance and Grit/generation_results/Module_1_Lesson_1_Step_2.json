By recognizing these qualities in action, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how they appear in everyday life.\n\n## Vignette 1: The Marathon Runner\n\n> Maya decided to run a marathon despite never having run more than a mile before. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">She created a six-month training plan</span> and began waking up at 5 AM daily. <span style=\"background-color: orange\">During month three, she developed shin splints but consulted a physical therapist instead of quitting</span>. She modified her training but <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">continued working toward her goal</span>. On race day, <span style=\"background-color: orange\">at mile 20, she hit \"the wall\" where her body wanted to stop, but she pushed through</span> by focusing on her breathing and remembering her training journey. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">She finished the marathon in just under 5 hours</span>, achieving her personal goal.\n\n### Pause and Think\nWhat specific actions show Maya's grit? How did she demonstrate perseverance when facing obstacles?\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Hint**</summary>\nLook for moments when Maya faced challenges but continued anyway, and notice her long-term commitment to her goal.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Model Answer**</summary>\nMaya demonstrated grit through her long-term commitment (six-month training plan) and consistent early-morning training. Her perseverance was evident when she sought solutions to her shin splints rather than quitting. The ultimate display of grit came when she pushed through \"the wall\" at mile 20, showing her ability to overcome both physical and mental barriers to achieve her goal.\n</details>\n\n## Vignette 2: The Coding Student\n\n> Jamal enrolled in a coding bootcamp with no prior experience. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">He spent two hours every evening after work practicing</span>, even when tired. <span style=\"background-color: orange\">When his first project received critical feedback, he felt discouraged but asked his instructor for additional guidance</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">He revised his approach and put in extra weekend hours</span> to improve. <span style=\"background-color: orange\">During the final project, his computer crashed, losing three days of work. Instead of panicking, he took a deep breath, retrieved what he could from backups, and rebuilt the rest</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">He graduated with a portfolio strong enough to land a junior developer position</span>.\n\n### Pause and Think\nHow did Jamal's response to setbacks demonstrate grit? What patterns do you notice in how he approached challenges?\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Hint**</summary>\nConsider how Jamal responded emotionally to setbacks and what actions he took afterward. Look for consistency in his approach.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Model Answer**</summary>\nJamal's grit was evident in his consistent daily practice despite fatigue. When faced with criticism, he demonstrated perseverance by seeking help rather than giving up. His response to losing work showed remarkable resilience\u2014he managed his emotions and immediately took action to solve the problem. Throughout his journey, Jamal maintained a pattern of facing obstacles directly, finding solutions, and putting in extra effort when needed. His passion for coding and perseverance through multiple challenges exemplify true grit.\n</details>\n\n## Reflection\nThink about your own life. Can you identify a situation where you've shown grit similar to Maya or Jamal? What cues from these examples might help you recognize opportunities to develop greater perseverance in your own challenges?\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Worked Examples\u2014Spot the Grit\n\n## Introduction\nIn this lesson, we'll analyze two real-life scenarios to identify signs of perseverance and grit. Remember that while perseverance is continuing despite difficulties, grit involves passion and sustained effort toward long-term goals. Let's practice spotting these qualities in action!\n\n## Vignette 1: The Marathon Runner\n\nMaya decided to run a marathon after watching her mother complete one. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">She created a six-month training plan</span> and began waking up at 5 AM daily. <span style=\"background-color: lightblue\">During month three, she developed shin splints but consulted a physical therapist instead of quitting</span>. She modified her training but <span style=\"background-color: lightgreen\">continued working toward her goal</span>. On race day, <span style=\"background-color: pink\">at mile 20, she hit \"the wall\" where her body wanted to stop, but she pushed through by focusing on her breathing and remembering why she started</span>. Maya finished the marathon in 4 hours and 32 minutes.\n\n### Pause and Think\nWhat specific actions show Maya's grit rather than just perseverance?\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Hint**</summary>\nLook for evidence of long-term commitment and passion, not just pushing through a single obstacle.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Model Answer**</summary>\nMaya demonstrated grit through her six-month training plan (long-term commitment), waking up at 5 AM consistently (sustained effort), adapting when injured rather than quitting (resilience), and pushing through \"the wall\" by connecting with her purpose (passion). This wasn't just about overcoming one obstacle but maintaining dedication to a long-term goal despite multiple challenges.\n</details>\n\n## Vignette 2: The Coding Student\n\nJamal enrolled in a coding bootcamp with no prior experience. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">He set a goal to build a functioning app by the end of the 12-week program</span>. <span style=\"background-color: lightblue\">When he failed his first assessment, he requested additional practice problems</span> and <span style=\"background-color: lightgreen\">stayed an extra hour after class three days a week</span>. <span style=\"background-color: pink\">His classmates often finished projects faster, but Jamal refused to compare himself to others</span>. Instead, <span style=\"background-color: orange\">he focused on his personal improvement, celebrating when he solved problems that once seemed impossible</span>. By week 10, Jamal was helping newer students understand concepts he had struggled with initially.\n\n### Pause and Think\nHow did Jamal's response to setbacks demonstrate grit?\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Hint**</summary>\nConsider how he reacted to failure and what actions he took that showed commitment to his learning journey.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Model Answer**</summary>\nJamal's grit is evident in how he responded to failure constructively by seeking more practice rather than becoming discouraged. His commitment to staying late showed sustained effort toward his goal. Most importantly, he demonstrated a growth mindset by focusing on his own progress rather than comparing himself to others. His willingness to help others later showed how he had internalized his learning journey, another sign of grit\u2014finding meaning in the struggle itself.\n</details>\n\n## Reflection\nThink about a time when you faced a challenge. Did you show perseverance, grit, or both? What colored highlights from these examples connect to your own experience?\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Worked Examples\u2014Spot the Grit\n\n## Introduction\nIn this lesson, we'll analyze two real-life scenarios to identify signs of perseverance and grit. Remember, perseverance is continuing despite difficulties, while grit combines perseverance with passion over extended periods. Let's practice spotting these qualities in action!\n\n## Vignette 1: The Marathon Runner\n\n> Maria had trained for six months for her first marathon. On race day, at mile 18, she developed a painful blister on her foot. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Despite the discomfort, Maria adjusted her running form</span> and continued. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">When negative thoughts crept in, she reminded herself of all the early mornings she'd spent training</span>. <span style=\"background-color: orange\">Though she finished 30 minutes slower than her goal time, Maria crossed the finish line</span>, already planning improvements for her next race.\n\n### Pause and Think\nWhat specific actions or thoughts demonstrate grit in this story?\n\n<details>\n<summary>**HINT**</summary>\nLook for evidence of both perseverance (continuing despite pain) and long-term passion or commitment.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**MODEL ANSWER**</summary>\nMaria showed grit through: 1) Continuing despite physical pain (adjusting her form rather than quitting), 2) Using mental strategies to overcome negative thoughts, 3) Maintaining long-term commitment (six months of training), and 4) Already planning for future improvement rather than giving up after one setback.\n</details>\n\n## Vignette 2: The Coding Project\n\n> Jamal was working on a coding project for his portfolio. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">After three weeks of work, his computer crashed and he lost two days of unsaved progress</span>. Frustrated, he considered abandoning the project. <span style=\"background-color: orange\">Instead, he took a day to clear his head, then returned to rebuild his work</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">He stayed up late for several nights to catch up</span> and <span style=\"background-color: orange\">implemented a new backup system to prevent future losses</span>. The finished project became the centerpiece of his portfolio.\n\n### Pause and Think\nHow does Jamal's response to setback differ from simply being stubborn?\n\n<details>\n<summary>**HINT**</summary>\nConsider whether he just pushes through blindly or adapts strategically while maintaining his goal.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**MODEL ANSWER**</summary>\nJamal's response shows grit rather than stubbornness because: 1) He takes a strategic pause rather than reacting emotionally, 2) He adapts by implementing a backup system (learning from failure), 3) He maintains focus on the long-term goal (completed portfolio) rather than just finishing for finishing's sake, and 4) He shows the passion aspect of grit by being willing to sacrifice (late nights) for his meaningful goal.\n</details>\n\n## Your Turn\nIn these examples, note how grit involves both the immediate perseverance through obstacles and the long-term commitment to meaningful goals. The highlighted sections show moments where the individuals demonstrated key aspects of grit:\n- Yellow highlights: Perseverance through immediate challenges\n- Orange highlights: Long-term passion and commitment\n\nAs you encounter challenges in your own life, remember to look for opportunities to develop and demonstrate grit!\n</educational_content>"
