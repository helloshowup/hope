    "<educational_content>\n# Capstone Reflection Panel (Spiral 2)\n\n## Discussion Prompt: Your Perseverance Journey\n\nIn this final reflection panel, take a moment to share your most significant insight about perseverance gained throughout this course. What has been your biggest \"aha moment\" regarding grit and perseverance? How has this insight changed your approach to challenges? Consider how this understanding will impact your future goals and obstacles.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Write a response (100-150 words) sharing your most meaningful perseverance insight\n2. Respond thoughtfully to at least two of your peers' reflections\n3. Post a brief closing reflection after engaging with your peers\n\n### Example Discussion Post:\n\"My biggest insight about perseverance came when I realized that failure isn't the opposite of success\u2014it's actually part of the journey toward it. Before this course, I viewed setbacks as signs I should quit. Now I understand that perseverance isn't about never falling; it's about how you respond when you do. This shift in perspective helped me recently when I struggled with a challenging project. Instead of giving up after initial difficulties, I viewed them as learning opportunities. I broke down the problem into smaller steps and celebrated small victories along the way. This approach not only helped me complete the project but also made me more confident in tackling future challenges. I've learned that perseverance is a skill that can be developed, not just a trait some people naturally have.\"\n\n## Closing Reflection\nAfter engaging with your peers, post a brief message reflecting on how their insights have expanded your understanding of perseverance and grit.\n</educational_content>",
