    "<educational_content>\n# Evaluate Two Scenarios: Demonstrating Grit\n\nRead the two scenarios below and determine which student demonstrates stronger grit.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\nMia struggled with algebra all semester. After failing her midterm, she felt discouraged but created a study schedule, sought help from her teacher during lunch periods, and joined a study group. Though she still found the material challenging, she persisted with her plan for eight weeks. Her final grade improved from an F to a B-.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\nJordan received a C on his history project. He was disappointed and complained to friends that the teacher graded unfairly. For his next assignment, he put in extra effort the night before it was due and earned a B. Jordan was satisfied with this improvement and maintained his usual study habits afterward.\n\n**Which student demonstrated stronger grit?**\n\u25cb Mia\n\u25cb Jordan\n\n**Explain your choice in one sentence:**\n[Text entry field]\n\n**Feedback:**\nMia demonstrated stronger grit by creating a systematic plan, seeking help, and maintaining consistent effort over an extended period despite ongoing challenges, while Jordan showed a temporary increase in effort without sustained commitment to improvement.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Evaluate Two Scenarios\n\nRead the following scenarios about two students facing challenges. Then select which student demonstrates stronger grit and perseverance.\n\n## Scenario 1: Jamie\nJamie received a failing grade on a math test. Feeling discouraged, Jamie avoided studying for the next test and instead focused on other subjects where success came more easily. When the next math test approached, Jamie called in sick to avoid taking it.\n\n## Scenario 2: Taylor\nTaylor also failed a math test. After receiving the grade, Taylor met with the teacher to understand the mistakes, created a study schedule, and spent extra time working through practice problems. Despite finding the material difficult, Taylor took the next test and improved by one letter grade.\n\n**Which student showed stronger grit?**\n\u25cb Jamie\n\u25cb Taylor\n\n**In one sentence, explain your choice:**\n[Text entry field]\n\n*Feedback: Taylor demonstrated stronger grit by facing the challenge directly, seeking help, creating a plan, and persisting despite difficulties. Grit involves working through obstacles rather than avoiding them.*\n</educational_content>",

After failing the midterm, Jamie felt discouraged but created a study schedule, met with the teacher twice weekly for extra help, and practiced problems daily despite continued difficulty.
