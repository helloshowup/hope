    "<educational_content>\n# Mini-Case Analysis: Overcoming Setbacks\n\n## Scenario\nJaime was excited about joining the school basketball team but didn't make the final cut after tryouts. The coach mentioned Jaime needed to improve ball-handling skills and defensive footwork. Jaime feels embarrassed and is considering giving up basketball altogether.\n\n## What would be the most effective mindset shift for Jaime?\n\nA) \"I'm just not athletic enough for basketball. I should find something else I'm naturally good at.\"\nB) \"The coach was unfair. I played better than some people who made the team.\"\nC) \"This feedback shows exactly what I need to practice. I can work on these skills and try again next season.\"\nD) \"I'll just focus on a different sport where I don't need those specific skills.\"\n\n## Feedback\nThe optimal answer is C. This response demonstrates a growth mindset by viewing the setback as information rather than failure. Jaime recognizes that skills can be developed through dedicated practice, embraces the coach's feedback as a roadmap for improvement, and maintains persistence toward the goal. This mindset shift transforms disappointment into an opportunity for growth.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Mini-Case Analysis: Navigating Setbacks\n\n## Scenario\nJamal was excited about his science fair project on renewable energy. After weeks of work, his solar panel prototype failed during the final testing phase, just two days before the fair. He feels devastated and is considering withdrawing from the competition.\n\n## Which mindset shift would be most beneficial for Jamal?\nA) \"This proves I'm not good at science projects.\"\nB) \"I should have chosen an easier project topic.\"\nC) \"This setback gives me a chance to troubleshoot and improve my design.\"\nD) \"Some people are just naturally better at building things than I am.\"\n\n## Feedback\nThe optimal response is C. This represents a growth mindset approach where Jamal views the failure as temporary and an opportunity to learn. Rather than attributing the setback to fixed abilities (options A and D) or avoiding challenge (option B), choice C embraces the difficulty as part of the learning process. This perspective fosters resilience and encourages problem-solving, key components of perseverance when facing obstacles.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Mini-Case Analysis: Navigating Academic Setbacks\n\n## Scenario\nAlex was excited about taking an advanced math course this semester. However, after receiving a D on the first major test despite studying for hours, Alex feels devastated and is considering dropping the class.\n\n## What would be the most effective mindset shift for Alex?\n\nA) \"I should drop this class and take something easier instead.\"\nB) \"This proves I'm not a math person. I should focus on my strengths elsewhere.\"\nC) \"This initial setback is part of learning. I need to analyze my study approach and seek help.\"\nD) \"The teacher probably makes impossible tests. I should just memorize everything next time.\"\n\n## Feedback\nThe best answer is C. This response demonstrates a growth mindset by viewing the setback as temporary and addressable through strategy adjustment. Rather than defining ability as fixed (answers A and B) or attributing failure to external factors (answer D), option C embraces challenge as an opportunity for development\u2014a core principle of perseverance and academic resilience.\n</educational_content>"
