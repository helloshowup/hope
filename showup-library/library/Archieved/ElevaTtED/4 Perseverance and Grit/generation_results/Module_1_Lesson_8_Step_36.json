New ideas and projects sometimes distract me from previous ones\n2. Setbacks don't discourage me\n3. I often set a goal but later choose to pursue a different one\n4. I am a hard worker\n5. I have difficulty maintaining my focus on projects that take more than a few months to complete\n6. I finish whatever I begin\n7. I am diligent\n8. I have been obsessed with a certain idea or project for a short time but later lost interest\n\n## Your Grit Score\n\n[Interactive bar graph would appear here showing the student's score on a scale of 1-5]\n\n## Interpretation Guide:\n- 1.0-2.0: Developing Grit - You're just beginning to build perseverance\n- 2.1-3.0: Moderate Grit - You show persistence in some areas\n- 3.1-4.0: Strong Grit - You demonstrate good perseverance in most situations\n- 4.1-5.0: Exceptional Grit - You show remarkable determination across challenges\n\nYour score helps identify areas where you can develop greater perseverance.\n</educational_content>",
