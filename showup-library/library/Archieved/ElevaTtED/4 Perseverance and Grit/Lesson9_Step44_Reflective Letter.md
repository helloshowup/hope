## Sample Opening Paragraph

```
Dear Reader,

As I reflect on my journey through this semester, I am struck by how significantly my understanding of perseverance has evolved. When I began this course, I viewed challenges as obstacles to avoid rather than opportunities for growth. Through various experiences and deliberate practice of resilience strategies, I've developed a stronger sense of grit that has transformed not only my academic approach but also how I face personal challenges. The following reflections highlight key moments in this transformation.
