## Setting Up Your Portfolio (Step-by-Step Guide)

### What You'll Need
- Access to a cloud storage service (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
- A computer or mobile device with internet access
- Your first artifact ready to upload (this could be a written reflection, image, or document)

### Step 1: Create Your Main Portfolio Folder
1. Log in to your preferred cloud storage service
2. Click on "New" or "Create" button
3. Select "Folder"
4. Name your folder "Perseverance and Grit Portfolio"
5. Click "Create" or "Save"

### Step 2: Create Organizational Subfolders
Inside your main portfolio folder:
1. Create a subfolder called "Reflections"
2. Create a subfolder called "Strategies"
3. Create a subfolder called "Evidence of Growth"
4. Create a subfolder called "Resources"

**Pro Tip:** Organizing your work from the beginning will make it easier to find specific items when you need them later in the course.

### Step 3: Upload Your First Artifact
1. Open the appropriate subfolder where your first artifact belongs
2. Click "Upload" or drag and drop your file into the folder
3. Wait for the upload to complete
4. Verify that your file appears in the folder

### Step 4: Adjust Sharing Settings
1. Return to your main portfolio folder
2. Right-click on the folder or find the "Share" option
3. Click "Share" or "Get shareable link"
4. Adjust permissions:
   - For teacher access: Set to "Anyone with the link can view"
   - For privacy: Set to "Only specific people can access"
5. Copy the link to share with your teacher when required

**Important:** Test your sharing link by opening it in an incognito/private browser window to ensure others can access it properly.

## Portfolio Management Best Practices
- **Regular Updates**: Schedule 15 minutes weekly to add new artifacts
- **Organization**: Use clear file names including dates (e.g., "Reflection_10-15-2023")
- **Backup**: Download important files periodically as a backup
- **Privacy**: Be mindful of what personal information you include
- **Accessibility**: Ensure file formats are common (.pdf, .jpg, .docx)

## What to Include in Your Portfolio

| Section | Examples | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Reflections | Journal entries, audio recordings, response to prompts | Document your thoughts and feelings about challenges |
| Strategies | Notes, mind maps, technique summaries | Collect tools that help you persist |
| Evidence of Growth | Before/after work samples, progress trackers | Show your improvement over time |
| Resources | Articles, videos, quotes, worksheets | Save helpful materials for future reference |

## Your First Portfolio Assignment
Write a 1-2 paragraph reflection answering: "What do perseverance and grit mean to me personally?" Upload this to your "Reflections" folder by the end of this week.
