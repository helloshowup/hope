## Defining Key Terms

**Perseverance** is the steady persistence in a course of action despite difficulties, obstacles, or discouragement. It's continuing to try even when things get tough.

**Grit** is a combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals. It's sticking with your future—day in, day out—not just for weeks or months, but for years.

## Comparing Perseverance and Grit

| Characteristic | Perseverance | Grit |
|----------------|--------------|------|
| Time frame | Can be short-term | Always long-term |
| Focus | Overcoming immediate obstacles | Maintaining commitment to ultimate goals |
| Key element | Persistence | Passion + Persistence |
| Example | Finishing a difficult homework assignment | Practicing an instrument daily for years |
| Mindset | "I won't give up" | "I'm committed to mastery" |

## Real Stories of Perseverance and Grit

**Story 1: Alex's Perseverance**
Alex struggled with math throughout middle school. When faced with a particularly challenging algebra problem, most students would skip it and move on. But Alex would stay after class, ask questions, watch tutorial videos, and try different approaches until solving it. This perseverance—tackling each obstacle one by one—helped Alex pass the class despite initial difficulties.

**Story 2: Jordan's Grit**
Jordan dreamed of making the varsity basketball team. Despite being cut twice, Jordan practiced shooting 100 baskets every morning before school for three years straight. Through summer heat and winter cold, regardless of mood or other commitments, Jordan maintained this routine. This combination of passion for basketball and persistent practice—grit—eventually earned Jordan a starting position on the team.

## The Power of "Yet"

Both perseverance and grit involve embracing the power of "yet." When you say:
- "I don't understand this" → "I don't understand this **yet**"
- "I can't do it" → "I can't do it **yet**"

This small word creates a growth mindset that fuels both perseverance and grit.
