# The Power of Community Support

## Learning Objective
Students will understand how peer and community support systems contribute to building perseverance and resilience, and apply this knowledge to strengthen their own support networks.

## Video Montage: "Stronger Together"
*Below is a description of the video content, followed by a transcript excerpt. The complete video would include student interviews with subtitles and closed captions.*

### Video Description
The video montage features interviews with diverse high school students sharing personal stories about how support from friends, family, and community helped them overcome challenges in their academic and personal lives.

### Video Transcript Excerpt
**Student 1:** "When I was struggling with my advanced math class, my study group kept me going. We'd meet twice a week, and knowing they were counting on me helped me push through when I wanted to quit."

**Student 2:** "After my injury last season, I thought my athletic career was over. My teammates visited me during recovery and even modified practice so I could participate from the sidelines. Their support is why I'm back on the field today."

**Student 3:** "Moving to a new school sophomore year was overwhelming. The student ambassador program connected me with people who showed me around and included me at lunch. That small act of kindness made all the difference."

## The Research: Why Community Matters

Studies consistently demonstrate the power of social support in building resilience:

- Students with strong peer relationships are 78% more likely to persevere through academic challenges.
- Teenagers who identify at least one supportive adult in their lives show 56% higher resilience scores.
- Group project completion rates increase by 34% when members report feeling supported by teammates.
- High school students who participate in community organizations report 40% higher levels of grit and determination.

## Activity: Mapping Your Support Network (20-25 minutes)

### Instructions
1. Open a new document in your preferred format (digital or paper).
2. Draw or create yourself in the center.
3. Create four sections around you labeled: Family, Friends, School, and Community.
4. In each section, write the names of people who support you.
5. Next to each name, note one specific way they provide support.
6. Add a star next to the three people who most help you persevere during challenges.

**Tip:** If you're using a digital format, consider using a mind-mapping tool or simple drawing program. If working on paper, you'll submit a photo or scan of your completed map.

### Reflection Questions (Submit your responses in the text box below)
- Who appears in multiple categories in your support network?
- What patterns do you notice about the types of support that help you most?
