### Scenario 1:
You have three major assignments due in the same week, and you're feeling overwhelmed.

- A) Positive self-talk
- B) Time management planning
- C) Mindful breathing

**Correct Answer: B) Time management planning**
*Feedback: When facing multiple deadlines, creating a structured plan helps break down overwhelming tasks into manageable steps. While positive self-talk and mindful breathing are valuable for managing emotions, time management directly addresses the organizational challenge presented.*

### Scenario 2:
You received a lower grade than expected on a test despite studying hard.

- A) Growth mindset reflection
- B) Goal visualization
- C) Social support seeking

**Correct Answer: A) Growth mindset reflection**

### Scenario 3:
You're having trouble focusing during your online study sessions.

- A) Environment modification
- B) Physical activity break
- C) Progressive muscle relaxation

**Correct Answer: A) Environment modification**
