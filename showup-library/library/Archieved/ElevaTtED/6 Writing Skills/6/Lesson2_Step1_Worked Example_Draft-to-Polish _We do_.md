# Worked Example—Draft-to-Polish “We do”

# Worked Example—Draft-to-Polish "We do"

## Introduction
In this guided practice, we'll walk through the process of taking a rough draft and polishing it into a more effective piece of writing. We'll use a step-by-step approach that mirrors what professional writers do: identify issues, create targeted revision strategies, and implement improvements. This "we do" exercise will provide scaffolding as you learn to refine your own writing.

## Starting Point: Our Rough Paragraph

Let's begin with this rough paragraph:

> College students face many challenges today. They have to deal with stress. Financial problems are common. Time management is hard too. Some students work jobs while studying. Mental health issues can happen. Technology can be distracting. Students need support from their schools.

## Step 1: Highlighting Idea Issues

First, let's identify the conceptual problems with this paragraph:
- **Lacks a clear main idea/topic sentence**
- **Ideas are disconnected** - just a list of statements
- **No development** of any single point
- **Missing transitions** between ideas
- **No conclusion** or takeaway

## Step 2: Using AI to Help Revise

Here's a prompt we could use to address these idea issues:

```
Revise this paragraph about college student challenges to include:
1. A clear topic sentence that previews main points
2. Logical organization of related ideas
3. Transitions between ideas
4. Supporting details for each challenge
5. A concluding sentence that offers perspective
Keep the same general content but improve structure and flow.
```

**Your Turn**: Before moving on, take 5-10 minutes to create your own revised version addressing these issues. This practice will help you develop your revision skills.

## Suggested Revision (Ideas)

> College students today face multiple interconnected challenges that impact their academic success and wellbeing. The most pressing issues include financial strain, as many students juggle part-time jobs with full course loads to manage rising tuition costs and living expenses. Related to this financial pressure is the difficulty of time management, where students must balance academic responsibilities with work, social activities, and self-care. Additionally, these stressors often contribute to mental health concerns, with increasing rates of anxiety and depression among college populations. While technology provides valuable educational tools, it can simultaneously present distractions that further complicate students' focus and productivity. Universities must recognize these interrelated challenges and develop comprehensive support systems that address students' academic, financial, and emotional needs.

## Step 3: Analyzing the Improvement

Let's compare the original and revised versions:
- The revised paragraph now has a **clear topic sentence** that previews the main challenges
- Related ideas are **grouped together** (financial issues with time management, stressors with mental health)
- **Transitions** ("Related to this," "Additionally," "While") connect ideas logically
- Each challenge now has **supporting details** that develop the point
- The paragraph ends with a **concluding statement** that offers perspective on solutions

## Step 4: Further Refinement for Clarity, Cohesion, and Grammar

Now let's examine the revised paragraph for:
- **Clarity issues**: Any confusing phrases or vague language
- **Cohesion problems**: How well sentences flow together
- **Grammar errors**: Technical writing issues

AI prompt for this level of revision:

```
Polish this paragraph about college student challenges by:
1. Simplifying complex sentences where needed
2. Ensuring consistent tense and voice
3. Removing unnecessary words
4. Strengthening transitions between ideas
5. Checking for grammar and punctuation accuracy
```

## Applying This to Your Own Writing

When revising your own work:
1. First focus on big-picture issues (main idea, organization, development)
2. Then address sentence-level concerns (clarity, transitions, grammar)
3. Use AI tools as a revision partner, not a replacement for your critical thinking
4. Always review AI suggestions carefully and make final decisions yourself
