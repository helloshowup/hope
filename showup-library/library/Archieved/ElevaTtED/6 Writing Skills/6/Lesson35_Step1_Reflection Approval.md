# Reflection Approval

# Reflection Approval Process

## Understanding the Reflection Rubric

Your reflection submissions are evaluated using three key criteria:

1. **Depth of Reflection** - How thoroughly you analyze your writing process and learning journey
2. **Personal Connections** - How effectively you connect concepts to your own experiences and growth
3. **Actionability** - How clearly you identify specific, achievable steps for improvement

## Proficiency Requirements

To receive approval, your reflection must achieve at least a **Proficient** rating overall. This means:

- Your reflection demonstrates thoughtful analysis beyond surface observations
- You make meaningful connections to your personal writing experience
- You include specific, realistic actions for improving your writing process

## Tips for Success

- Be specific about what you learned and how it affected your understanding
- Include examples from your own work or experiences
- Describe clear next steps that are within your control
- Review the feedback if your submission isn't approved - you can revise and resubmit!
