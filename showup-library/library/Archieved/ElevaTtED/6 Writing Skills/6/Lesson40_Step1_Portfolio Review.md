# Portfolio Review

# Portfolio Review Process

## Automated Rubric Assessment

Your writing portfolio will be evaluated through our automated rubric system which checks for three essential components:

1. **Variety**: Your portfolio must demonstrate diverse writing styles and formats
2. **Polish**: Each piece must be thoroughly edited and free of grammatical errors
3. **Reflection**: Each submission must include a thoughtful reflection on your writing process

## Minimum Requirements

- At least three polished writing pieces
- Each piece must be accompanied by a reflection (250-300 words)
- Works must represent different writing styles (e.g., narrative, persuasive, analytical)

The automated system will verify these requirements are met before your portfolio advances to final showcase review. Submissions not meeting these criteria will be returned for revision.

## Success Tips

- **Quality over quantity**: Three exceptional pieces with thoughtful reflections will score higher than numerous underdeveloped works
- **Use the Writing Lab**: Take advantage of Excel High School's Writing Lab for feedback before final submission
- **Time management**: Plan ahead to allow time for revisions based on automated feedback
- **Self-assessment**: Use the rubric criteria to evaluate your own work before submission
