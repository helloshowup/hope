# Critical Thinking in Writing—“I do”

# Critical Thinking in Writing: Building Strong Arguments

## Introduction

Welcome to our lesson on critical thinking in writing! Today, we'll explore how to strengthen your writing by using claims and evidence effectively. Strong writing isn't just about expressing opinions—it's about supporting those opinions with solid evidence that convinces your reader.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Distinguish between claims and evidence in written arguments
- Identify common logical fallacies and revise flawed reasoning
- Incorporate statistics and other evidence to strengthen your writing
- Apply critical thinking skills to your own writing process

## Claims vs. Evidence: The Foundation of Strong Arguments

**Claims** are statements that express your position or argument. They tell the reader what you believe or what you're trying to prove.

**Evidence** consists of facts, statistics, examples, or expert opinions that support your claim. Evidence is what makes your argument credible and convincing.

Let's look at an example:

* **Claim:** "Social media has a negative impact on teenagers' mental health."
* **Evidence:** "According to a 2022 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, teenagers who spend more than three hours daily on social media are 35% more likely to report symptoms of depression."

Notice how the evidence provides specific information that supports the claim. Without evidence, claims are just opinions.

**Quick Check:** Can you identify which of these is a claim and which is evidence?
1. "The cost of college textbooks has increased by 88% over the past decade."
2. "College textbooks are too expensive for most students."

## Recognizing Logical Fallacies

When constructing arguments, it's important to avoid logical fallacies—errors in reasoning that weaken your argument.

Here are three common fallacies to watch for:

1. **Circular Reasoning:** Using your conclusion as evidence for itself
2. **Appeal to Popularity:** Claiming something is true because many people believe it
3. **False Dichotomy:** Presenting only two options when more exist

**Example of a Fallacy:**

"Everyone should own a smartphone because everyone has one these days."

This is a circular reasoning fallacy. The claim (everyone should own a smartphone) is supported by evidence (everyone has one) that essentially restates the claim rather than proving it.

**Improved Argument:**

"Smartphones have become essential tools in modern society because they provide access to emergency services, educational resources, and job opportunities that are increasingly moving online."

This argument provides actual reasons that support the claim, rather than circular logic.

## Strengthening Arguments with Statistics

Statistics are powerful forms of evidence that can significantly strengthen your writing. Let's see how adding a statistic improves an argument:

**Without Statistics:**
"Many college graduates struggle to find employment in their field of study."

**With Statistics:**
"Many college graduates struggle to find employment in their field of study. A recent survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that only 55% of 2022 graduates secured jobs related to their majors within six months of graduation."

The statistic transforms a vague claim into a specific, verifiable statement that carries more weight.

**Pro Tip:** Always cite your statistics from reliable sources. Government agencies, peer-reviewed journals, and respected research organizations typically provide the most trustworthy data.

## Application: Evaluating Arguments

Read the following paragraph and identify:
1. The main claim
2. The evidence provided
3. Any potential logical fallacies

"The four-day work week should be adopted by all companies. Studies show that when companies implement four-day work weeks, employee satisfaction increases. Plus, everyone I know would prefer to work four days instead of five."

## Quick Recap

In this lesson, we've covered:
1. The difference between claims and evidence
2. How to identify and avoid logical fallacies
3. The power of adding statistics to strengthen your arguments

## Your Turn to Practice

Now it's time to apply what you've learned! For your next writing assignment:
1. Identify your main claims
2. Gather specific evidence to support each claim
3. Check your arguments for logical fallacies
4. Incorporate relevant statistics where appropriate

**Self-Assessment Checklist:**
- [ ] Have I clearly stated my main claims?
- [ ] Have I provided specific evidence for each claim?
- [ ] Have I avoided logical fallacies in my reasoning?
- [ ] Have I incorporated relevant statistics or expert opinions?
- [ ] Have I cited all sources properly?

Remember, critical thinking in writing isn't just about making your point—it's about making your point in a way that's logical, well-supported, and convincing to your readers.

By applying these skills, you'll transform your writing from merely stating opinions to crafting powerful, evidence-based arguments that engage and persuade your audience.
