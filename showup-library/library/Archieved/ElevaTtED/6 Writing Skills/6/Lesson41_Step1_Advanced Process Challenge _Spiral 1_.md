# Advanced Process Challenge (Spiral 1)

# Advanced Process Challenge (Spiral 1)

## Discussion Forum Activity

### Instructions

In this activity, you'll analyze a writer's stalled paragraph, diagnose which stage of the writing process has failed, and provide constructive feedback to help move the writing forward. Then, you'll engage with a classmate's solution by commenting on their analysis.

### The Stalled Paragraph

Read the following paragraph that a writer is struggling to develop further:

> I want to write about the impact of social media on teenagers today. Social media has both good and bad effects. Teenagers use platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Some people think it's harmful, while others see benefits. It's complicated and there are many opinions about this topic.

### Your Task:

1. **Diagnose the Problem**: Identify which stage of the writing process (brainstorming, drafting, revising, or editing) appears to have failed or stalled. Explain your reasoning with specific evidence from the paragraph.

2. **Suggest Next Actions**: Provide at least three specific, actionable steps the writer could take to move forward with their writing.

3. **Peer Engagement**: After posting your analysis, read and respond to at least one classmate's solution. Comment on the effectiveness of their diagnosis and suggestions. Do you agree with their assessment? Would you add any additional recommendations?

### Grading Criteria:
- Accurate identification of the stalled writing process stage with clear evidence (30%)
- Quality and specificity of recommended actions (40%)
- Thoughtful engagement with a peer's analysis (30%)

### Example Response Format:

**Diagnosis**: [Identify the stalled stage of the writing process]

**Evidence**: [Point to specific aspects of the paragraph that support your diagnosis]

**Recommended Actions**:

**Response to [Peer's Name]**: [Your thoughtful commentary on a classmate's analysis]

### Time Management Tip:
This activity should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete: 15-20 minutes for your analysis and 15-25 minutes to review and respond to a peer's work.

Remember to apply what you've learned about the writing process to provide meaningful analysis and constructive suggestions!
