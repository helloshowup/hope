# Process Snapshot: Writing Assessment System

The writing process at Excel High School is evaluated through our automated system that provides immediate feedback on your work. Here's how it works:

1. **Rubric Assessment**: The system checks your:
   - **Brainstorming notes**: How thoroughly you explore ideas and their relevance to your topic
   - **Initial draft**: Organization, structure, and content development
   - **Revision process**: Quality of your self-assessment and how effectively you apply changes

2. **Automated Grading**: Your submission receives an instant score based on how well you've demonstrated each step of the writing process. This allows you to:
   - See your strengths and areas for improvement
   - Understand which writing skills need more development
   - Track your progress over time

3. **Achievement Recognition**: When you score 80% or higher, you'll automatically unlock a Writing Process Badge in your student profile, which:
   - Documents your writing skill development
   - Builds your digital portfolio of achievements
   - Motivates continued growth in your writing practice

This assessment approach ensures you're mastering the complete writing cycle: brainstorming ideas, creating drafts, making meaningful revisions, and finalizing your work.

**Remember**: The focus is on your process, not just the final product! This approach helps develop lifelong writing skills that transfer to academic and professional settings.
