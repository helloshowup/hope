## Learning Objective
By completing this quiz, you will demonstrate your ability to identify and correct common grammatical errors related to pronouns, verb forms, and commonly confused words.

1. **You and him should go to the store.**
   *Correct version:* You and he should go to the store.
   *Explanation:* Use the subject pronoun "he" rather than the object pronoun "him" when it functions as part of the subject.

2. **Between you and I, the party was boring.**
   *Correct version:* Between you and me, the party was boring.
   *Explanation:* After prepositions like "between," use object pronouns ("me") not subject pronouns ("I").

3. **Me and Jessica are going to the movies tonight.**
   *Correct version:* Jessica and I are going to the movies tonight.
   *Explanation:* Use the subject pronoun "I" when it's part of the subject, and place yourself last in the sequence.

4. **You done good on your test.**
   *Correct version:* You did well on your test.
   *Explanation:* "Did" is the past tense of "do," and "well" is the adverb form needed to modify the verb.

5. **The teacher gave the assignments to you and I.**
   *Correct version:* The teacher gave the assignments to you and me.
   *Explanation:* After prepositions like "to," use object pronouns ("me").

6. **Your the best student in class.**
   *Correct version:* You're the best student in class.
   *Explanation:* "You're" (contraction of "you are") is needed here, not the possessive "your."

7. **If anyone needs help, they can ask you or myself.**
   *Correct version:* If anyone needs help, they can ask you or me.
   *Explanation:* Use "me" rather than "myself" unless it's truly reflexive (referring back to the subject).

8. **You should of called me yesterday.**
   *Correct version:* You should have called me yesterday.
   *Explanation:* The correct phrase is "should have," not "should of."

9. **Its going to be you who lead the presentation.**
   *Correct version:* It's going to be you who leads the presentation.
   *Explanation:* "It's" (contraction of "it is") is needed, and "leads" agrees with "who" referring to a singular "you."

10. **You was telling me about your vacation plans.**
    *Correct version:* You were telling me about your vacation plans.
    *Explanation:* "You" takes "were" (plural form) even when referring to one person.

## Tips for Success
* Remember that pronouns change form depending on their function in a sentence (subject vs. object).
* When in doubt about which pronoun to use, try removing the other person from the sentence to see what sounds correct.
* Pay attention to commonly confused words like "your/you're" and phrases like "should have" vs. "should of."
