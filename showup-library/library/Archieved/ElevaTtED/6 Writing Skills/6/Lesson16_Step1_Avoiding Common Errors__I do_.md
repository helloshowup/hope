# Avoiding Common Errors—“I do”

# Avoiding Common Errors—"I Do"

## Panel 1: Punctuation Basics
Punctuation marks are essential road signs for your readers. Here are the most common errors to avoid:

* **Comma Splices**: Don't join two complete sentences with only a comma.
  * ❌ I finished my homework, I went to bed.
  * ✓ I finished my homework, and I went to bed.
  * ✓ I finished my homework. I went to bed.
  * ✓ I finished my homework; I went to bed.

* **Apostrophes**: Use for possession or contractions, not plurals.
  * ❌ The student's were learning.
  * ✓ The students were learning.
  * ❌ I bought three book's.
  * ✓ I bought three books.

## Panel 2: Subject-Verb Agreement
Subjects and verbs must agree in number (singular/plural):

* **Singular subjects** take singular verbs:
  * ✓ The student works hard.
  * ✓ Each of the assignments requires careful attention.
  
* **Plural subjects** take plural verbs:
  * ✓ The students work hard.
  * ✓ Many of the questions involve critical thinking.
  
* Watch for subjects separated from verbs:
  * ❌ The list of items are on the desk.
  * ✓ The list of items is on the desk.
  * ❌ One of the students were absent.
  * ✓ One of the students was absent.

## Panel 3: Eliminating Wordiness
Clear writing is concise writing:

* **Remove redundancies**:
  * ❌ We arrived at 8:00 AM in the morning.
  * ✓ We arrived at 8:00 AM.
  * ❌ Please RSVP back to me.
  * ✓ Please RSVP to me.

* **Replace phrases with single words**:
  * ❌ Due to the fact that I was late...
  * ✓ Because I was late...
  * ❌ In the event that you cannot attend...
  * ✓ If you cannot attend...

* **Eliminate empty modifiers**:
  * ❌ This assignment is really very important.
  * ✓ This assignment is important.
  * ❌ The basically fundamental concept is actually quite simple.
  * ✓ The fundamental concept is simple.
