# Interactive Outline Builder—“We do”

# Interactive Outline Builder: Guided Practice

## Introduction

Welcome to the "We do" phase of our outline building process! In this interactive exercise, we'll work together to create a well-structured essay outline using our guided builder tool. This activity will help you apply the outline concepts we've learned and give you confidence to create your own outlines independently.

## The Interactive Outline Builder

The Interactive Outline Builder guides you through creating a strong essay structure with real-time feedback. Let's explore how it works:

### Step 1: Select Your Topic
Begin by entering your essay topic in the prompt field. Choose something you're knowledgeable and interested in writing about.

**Example Topic Field:**
```
My essay topic is: The impact of social media on teenage communication
```

### Step 2: Develop Your Thesis Statement
Based on your topic, craft a clear thesis statement that presents your main argument or position.

**Thesis Builder:**
```
Thesis Statement: Social media has fundamentally changed how teenagers communicate, leading to both positive and negative consequences.

✓ Your thesis makes a clear claim
✓ Your thesis is specific enough to support with evidence
```

### Step 3: Identify Three Main Points
Now, develop three main supporting points that will form the backbone of your essay.

**Main Points Section:**
```
Main Point 1: Social media platforms have expanded teenagers' social networks beyond geographic limitations.

Main Point 2: Digital communication has created new language patterns and communication styles among teens.

Main Point 3: The constant connectivity of social media has affected teenagers' face-to-face communication skills.

✓ Your main points directly support your thesis
✓ Your main points are distinct from each other
```

### Step 4: Add Supporting Evidence
For each main point, add 2-3 pieces of evidence that will support your claims.

**Evidence Slots:**
```
Evidence for Point 1:
• Statistics showing the average number of online connections teens maintain
• Example of international friendships formed through social media platforms

Evidence for Point 2:
• Evolution of texting abbreviations and emoji usage among teenagers
• Research on how digital communication affects writing in academic settings

Evidence for Point 3:
• Studies comparing conversation skills between heavy and light social media users
• Expert opinions from child development specialists
```

1. Check that all elements connect logically
