# Building Your Portfolio—“I do”

# Building Your Portfolio—"I do"

## The Purpose of Your Writing Portfolio

Welcome to the "Building Your Portfolio" module! A writing portfolio is much more than just a collection of papers—it's a strategic showcase of your development as a writer. Your portfolio serves several important purposes:

1. **Demonstrates Growth**: By including writing samples from different points in your academic journey, you show how your skills have improved over time.

2. **Showcases Versatility**: Including different types of writing (narrative, persuasive, analytical, research-based) proves your ability to adapt to various writing contexts.

3. **Provides Evidence of Mastery**: Your portfolio will serve as concrete proof that you've achieved the learning objectives for this course.

4. **Creates a Professional Tool**: Beyond this class, a well-developed portfolio can be used for college applications, job interviews, or other professional opportunities.

## Sample Student Portfolios

Let's look at some examples from previous Excel High School students who created outstanding portfolios:

**Example 1: Maria's Portfolio (Traditional Achiever)**
Maria organized her portfolio thematically, with sections for creative writing, academic essays, and professional communications. She included brief reflections before each piece explaining her writing process and what she learned.

**Example 2: Jason's Portfolio (Credit Recovery Student)**
Jason took a chronological approach, showing his progress from early assignments to final projects. He effectively used color-coding to highlight revisions and improvements in his writing over time.

**Example 3: Aiden's Portfolio (Adult Diploma Seeker)**
Aiden created a multimedia portfolio that included traditional written assignments alongside blog posts, podcast scripts, and social media content he created during the course. His portfolio emphasized practical writing skills relevant to his career goals.

## Top Three Tips for Portfolio Success

1. **Be Selective**: Quality matters more than quantity. Choose your strongest pieces that demonstrate different skills rather than including everything you've written. Aim for 5-7 diverse samples that truly showcase your abilities.

2. **Include Reflections**: For each piece in your portfolio, write a brief reflection (100-150 words) explaining your writing process, the challenges you faced, and what you learned. These reflections demonstrate your metacognitive skills and awareness of your own development.

3. **Revise and Polish**: Your portfolio should contain your best work. Take time to incorporate feedback from previous assignments, fix grammatical errors, and strengthen your arguments. This attention to detail shows your commitment to excellence.

## Time Management Suggestion

For most students, building a quality portfolio takes approximately:
- Initial setup: 30-45 minutes
- Adding each piece with reflection: 20-30 minutes per entry
- Final review and polishing: 1-2 hours

Consider scheduling specific times in your week to work on your portfolio rather than leaving it all for the end of the course.

Remember, your portfolio is a living document that will continue to evolve throughout this course. We'll revisit it regularly to add new pieces and refine existing ones. Next, we'll move to the "We do" portion where we'll work together on starting your portfolio.
