# Evidence Synthesis Sprint (Spiral 1)

# Evidence Synthesis Sprint (Spiral 1)

## Infographic Template Activity

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Organize research evidence to support a central claim
- Create a visual representation of your argument
- Evaluate how different pieces of evidence work together

### Overview
In this activity, you'll create a visual representation of your argument using an infographic template. This approach helps you organize your thinking and present evidence effectively to support your central claim.

### Instructions
1. Download the [Evidence Synthesis Infographic Template](https://link-to-template.com)
2. In the center circle, write your central claim - this is the main argument you're making
3. In the three surrounding bubbles, add supporting evidence from your research
4. For each evidence bubble, include:
   - A brief description of the evidence (2-3 sentences)
   - The source citation (author, year)
   - A 1-2 sentence explanation of how this evidence supports your central claim

### Example
**Central Claim:** "Social media has a significant impact on teenage mental health."

**Evidence Bubbles:**
1. **Research Evidence:** Study by Smith & Jones (2022) found teenagers who use social media 3+ hours daily reported 40% higher anxiety levels.
   **Connection:** This research establishes a direct correlation between heavy social media use and increased anxiety symptoms.

2. **Expert Testimony:** Interviews with five school counselors revealed consistent observations of social media-related stress among students.
   **Connection:** These front-line professionals provide real-world confirmation of the academic research findings.

3. **Statistical Trends:** CDC data shows a 56% increase in teen depression diagnoses since 2012, coinciding with widespread smartphone adoption.
   **Connection:** This timeline correlation suggests a possible relationship between social media access and declining mental health.
