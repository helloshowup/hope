    "<educational_content>\n# Evidence-Enhanced Essay: Adding Research-Based Sources\n\n## Introduction\nEnhancing your essays with credible research strengthens your arguments and demonstrates academic rigor. This lesson focuses on incorporating at least two research-based sources into your essay using proper MLA citation format.\n\n## Why Use Research Sources?\nResearch-based evidence:\n- Adds credibility to your claims\n- Provides expert perspectives\n- Strengthens your arguments\n- Shows you've engaged with the scholarly conversation\n\n## Finding Appropriate Sources\nWhen selecting sources, consider:\n- Academic journals and peer-reviewed publications\n- Books from reputable publishers\n- Government publications and reports\n- Established news sources and publications\n\nAvoid using:\n- Personal blogs without credentials\n- Wikipedia (though its references may lead to good sources)\n- Sources with clear bias or without author information\n\n## Integrating Sources Smoothly\nThere are three main ways to incorporate sources:\n\n1. **Direct quotation**: Use the exact words from the source in quotation marks\n   ```\n   According to Johnson, \"The impact of climate policy extends beyond environmental concerns to economic stability\" (42).\n   ```\n\n2. **Paraphrasing**: Restate the author's ideas in your own words\n   ```\n   Johnson argues that climate policy has significant implications for both environmental protection and economic health (42).\n   ```\n\n3. **Summarizing**: Condense longer passages into a brief overview\n   ```\n   Johnson's research demonstrates the interconnected nature of environmental policy and economic outcomes across multiple sectors (40-45).\n   ```\n\n## MLA Citation Format\nFor in-text citations:\n- Include author's last name and page number: (Smith 42)\n- If no author, use shortened title: (\"Climate Change\" 12)\n- For direct quotes, include page number: (Johnson 42)\n\nFor Works Cited entries (basic format):\n```\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Article.\" Title of Journal, vol. #, no. #, Publication Date, pp. page range.\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nJohnson, Maria. \"Climate Policy and Economic Impacts.\" Environmental Studies Quarterly, vol. 12, no. 2, 2021, pp. 40-48.\n```\n\n## Assignment: Evidence Enhancement\n1. Select an essay you've already written\n2. Identify at least two places where research evidence would strengthen your argument\n3. Find two appropriate research-based sources\n4. Integrate these sources using direct quotation, paraphrasing, or summarizing\n5. Add proper MLA in-text citations\n6. Create a Works Cited page\n7. **Highlight all additions** in your submission so your instructor can clearly see your enhancements\n\n## Example of Enhanced Paragraph\n\nOriginal paragraph:\n```\nSocial media has changed how teenagers communicate. Many teens prefer texting to face-to-face conversations. This has consequences for their social development.\n```\n\nEnhanced paragraph (with highlights):\n```\nSocial media has fundamentally changed how teenagers communicate. **According to developmental psychologist Jean Twenge, \"Teens who spend more time on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time on nonscreen activities are more likely to be happy\" (12).** Many teens now prefer texting to face-to-face conversations. **Research from the Pew Research Center indicates that 95% of teens have access to smartphones, and 45% report being online \"almost constantly\" (Anderson and Jiang 2).**  This shift has significant consequences for their social development.\n```\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Evidence-Enhanced Essay: Adding Research-Based Sources\n\n## Introduction\nStrengthening your essays with research-based evidence transforms your writing from personal opinion to scholarly work. This lesson guides you through adding at least two research-based sources to an existing essay, integrating them smoothly, and citing them properly using MLA format.\n\n## Why Evidence Matters\nResearch-based evidence:\n- Builds credibility for your arguments\n- Demonstrates your understanding of the topic\n- Connects your ideas to scholarly conversations\n- Provides support that readers find convincing\n\n## Finding Quality Research Sources\nStrong research-based sources include:\n- Peer-reviewed journal articles\n- Books from academic publishers\n- Government publications\n- Reports from established organizations\n- Articles from reputable news sources\n\nAvoid using sources like personal blogs, Wikipedia, or social media posts as your primary evidence.\n\n## Integrating Sources Smoothly\nWhen adding sources to your essay, aim for seamless integration using these techniques:\n\n1. **Signal phrases**: Introduce your source before the evidence.\n   - According to Johnson, \"...\"\n   - Research by Smith indicates that \"...\"\n   - In her comprehensive study, Rodriguez argues, \"...\"\n\n2. **Paraphrasing**: Restate the author's ideas in your own words while maintaining the original meaning.\n\n3. **Direct quotations**: Use the exact words from your source (with quotation marks) when the specific language is important.\n\n4. **Block quotations**: For quotes longer than four lines, indent the entire passage.\n\n## MLA Citation Format\nFor in-text citations:\n- Include the author's last name and page number: (Johnson 42)\n- If no author is available, use a shortened title: (\"Climate Change\" 12)\n\nFor Works Cited entries:\n```\nBook format:\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Year of Publication.\n\nJournal article format:\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Article.\" Title of Journal, Volume, Issue, Year, Pages.\n\nWebsite format:\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Page.\" Website Name, Publisher, Date of publication, URL.\n```\n\n## Your Assignment\n1. Select an essay you've previously written\n2. Identify at least two places where research evidence would strengthen your argument\n3.

Add proper MLA citations (both in-text and in a Works Cited page)\n6. **Highlight all new additions** in your submission so your instructor can clearly see where you've enhanced your essay\n\n## Example of Enhanced Paragraph\n\n**Original paragraph:**\nSocial media affects teenagers' mental health. Many teens report feeling anxious when they can't check their accounts.\n\n**Enhanced paragraph with evidence (highlighted):**\nSocial media significantly impacts teenagers' mental health. **According to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, adolescents who spend more than three hours daily on social media platforms have a 35% higher risk of developing anxiety symptoms compared to those with limited usage (Moreno and Garcia 42).** Many teens report feeling anxious when they can't check their accounts, **a phenomenon researchers have termed \"social media anxiety disorder,\" which affects approximately 27% of teenagers ages 13-17 (Patel 156).**\n</educational_content>",
