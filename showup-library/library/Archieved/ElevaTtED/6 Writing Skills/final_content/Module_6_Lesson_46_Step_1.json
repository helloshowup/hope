  "final_content": "# Peer-Feedback Rubric Upgrade (Spiral 1)\n\n## Learning Objective\nBy the end of this activity, you will create an enhanced peer-feedback rubric that fosters community engagement and provides clear evaluation criteria for your peers.\n\n## Activity Overview\nEffective peer feedback helps build our learning community while developing your critical thinking skills. In this activity, you'll design a comprehensive rubric that will help both you and your classmates provide more meaningful feedback.\n\n## Activity Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Design Your Enhanced Rubric\nCreate a new peer-feedback rubric that includes these four essential criteria:\n* Content Quality\n* Organization/Structure\n* Presentation/Style\n* Critical Thinking\n\n### Step 2: Add Bullet Descriptors\nFor each criterion, develop 3-4 bullet point descriptors that clearly explain what excellence looks like. For example:\n\n**Content Quality:**\n* Presents accurate, relevant information\n* Supports claims with specific evidence\n* Demonstrates thorough understanding of the topic\n* Shows depth of analysis beyond surface-level observations\n\n### Step 3: Create a Visual Representation\nTransform your rubric into a visually appealing format using one of these options:\n* Create an infographic using a tool like Canva, Piktochart, or Google Drawings\n* Design a color-coded table or chart in Google Docs or Word\n* Develop a simple but effective visual layout that works for you\n\nYour design should be:\n* Clear and easily readable\n* Visually organized with logical grouping\n* Professional in appearance\n* Accessible (consider color contrast, font size, etc.)\n\n### Step 4: Share Your Creation\nPost your completed rubric in the course forum with:\n1. Your visual rubric file\n2. A brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of how your enhanced rubric will improve peer feedback quality\n3. One question you'd like feedback on regarding your rubric design\n\n### Tips for Success\n* Focus on creating descriptors that are specific and actionable\n* Consider what would be most helpful for YOU when receiving feedback\n* Remember that visual design should enhance understanding, not distract from content\n* If you're struggling with design tools, prioritize clarity over visual complexity\n\n### Submission Timeline\n* Initial post due: [INSERT SPECIFIC DATE]\n* Peer responses due: [INSERT SPECIFIC DATE]\n\nRemember: An effective rubric provides specific, actionable criteria that helps both the reviewer provide targeted feedback and the recipient understand areas for improvement.",
