This gives you direction and helps make the research phase more focused and efficient.\n\n## Part 3: Short Application\n\nThink about a writing assignment you need to complete soon (or create a hypothetical one if needed). \n\nIn 3-5 sentences, describe:\n1. Which stage of the writing process you typically find most challenging\n2. One specific strategy you could use to overcome this challenge\n3.
