This lesson guides you through adding at least two research-based sources to an existing essay, integrating them smoothly, and citing them properly using MLA format.\n\n## Why Evidence Matters\nResearch-based evidence:\n- Builds credibility for your arguments\n- Demonstrates your understanding of the topic\n- Connects your ideas to scholarly conversations\n- Provides support that readers find convincing\n\n## Finding Quality Research Sources\nStrong research-based sources include:\n- Peer-reviewed journal articles\n- Books from academic publishers\n- Government publications\n- Reports from established organizations\n- Articles from reputable news sources\n\nAvoid using sources like personal blogs, Wikipedia, or social media posts as your primary evidence.\n\n## Integrating Sources Smoothly\nWhen adding sources to your essay, aim for seamless integration using these techniques:\n\n1. **Signal phrases**: Introduce your source before the evidence.\n   - According to Johnson, \"...\"\n   - Research by Smith indicates that \"...\"\n   - In her comprehensive study, Rodriguez argues, \"...\"\n\n2. **Paraphrasing**: Restate the author's ideas in your own words while maintaining the original meaning.\n\n3. **Direct quotations**: Use the exact words from your source (with quotation marks) when the specific language is important.\n\n4. **Block quotations**: For quotes longer than four lines, indent the entire passage.\n\n## MLA Citation Format\nFor in-text citations:\n- Include the author's last name and page number: (Johnson 42)\n- If no author is available, use a shortened title: (\"Climate Change\" 12)\n\nFor Works Cited entries:\n```\nBook format:\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Year of Publication.\n\nJournal article format:\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Article.\" Title of Journal, Volume, Issue, Year, Pages.\n\nWebsite format:\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Page.\" Website Name, Publisher, Date of publication, URL.\n```\n\n## Your Assignment\n1. Select an essay you've previously written\n2. Identify at least two places where research evidence would strengthen your argument\n3. Find at least two credible, research-based sources relevant to your topic\n4. Integrate these sources into your essay using the techniques discussed\n5. Add proper MLA citations (both in-text and in a Works Cited page)\n6. **Highlight all new additions** in your submission so your instructor can clearly see where you've enhanced your essay\n\n## Example of Enhanced Paragraph\n\n**Original paragraph:**\nSocial media affects teenagers' mental health. Many teens report feeling anxious when they can't check their accounts.\n\n**Enhanced paragraph with evidence (highlighted):**\nSocial media significantly impacts teenagers' mental health. **According to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, adolescents who spend more than three hours daily on social media platforms have a 35% higher risk of developing anxiety symptoms compared to those with limited usage (Moreno and Garcia 42).** Many teens report feeling anxious when they can't check their accounts, **a phenomenon researchers have termed \"social media anxiety disorder,\" which affects approximately 27% of teenagers ages 13-17 (Patel 156).**",
