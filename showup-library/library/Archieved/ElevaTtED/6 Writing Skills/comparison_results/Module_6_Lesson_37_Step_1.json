In this guided session, we'll work together to establish your digital portfolio, add your first writing sample, and create a meaningful caption. This portfolio will become a valuable collection of your best writing, demonstrating your growth and achievements throughout the course.\n\n## Step 1: Creating Your Portfolio Shell\n\nLet's begin by creating the basic structure for your portfolio:\n\n1. Log in to your student dashboard\n2. Navigate to the \"My Portfolio\" section in the main menu\n3. Click on the \"Create New Portfolio\" button\n4. Title your portfolio \"Writing Skills Showcase\" \n5. For the description, write: \"A collection of my best writing samples demonstrating various skills and techniques developed during my coursework\"\n6. Select \"Writing\" as the primary category\n7. Click \"Create Portfolio\" to generate your portfolio shell\n\nYour portfolio shell is now ready! Think of it as an empty display case that we'll gradually fill with your best writing samples.\n\n## Step 2: Uploading Your First Artifact\n\nNow, let's add your first writing sample:\n\n1. Within your new portfolio, locate and click the \"Add Artifact\" button\n2. Choose \"File Upload\" from the menu options\n3. Select the writing sample you'd like to showcase first (this could be a narrative essay, persuasive piece, poem, or any other completed writing assignment)\n4. Once your file is selected, click \"Upload\"\n5. Wait for the upload confirmation message before proceeding\n\nGreat job! Your first writing artifact is now part of your portfolio. This sample represents the beginning of your collection and serves as a baseline to measure your growth.\n\n## Step 3: Writing a Caption\n\nEvery artifact needs context to be fully appreciated. Let's create a caption for your first submission:\n\n1. Under your uploaded artifact, find the \"Add Caption\" field\n2. Write a 2-3 sentence description that includes:\n   - The title and type of writing (essay, story, poem, etc.)\n   - When you created it and for what purpose\n   - One specific writing skill or technique demonstrated in this piece\n3. Click \"Save Caption\" when you're satisfied with your description\n\nYour caption helps viewers understand the significance of your work and highlights your awareness of the writing techniques you've employed.\n\n## Autosave Progress\n\nGreat news! The portfolio system automatically saves your progress as you work. You'll notice small \"Saved\" notifications appearing periodically. This means you don't have to worry about losing your work if you need to step away.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou've successfully set up your portfolio structure, added your first writing sample, and created a meaningful caption. In our next session, you'll learn how to organize your artifacts into categories and create connections between different pieces of writing.\n\nRemember, your portfolio is a living document that will grow and evolve with your writing skills!",
