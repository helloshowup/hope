It's what makes your writing distinctively yours. In this activity, you'll revise an existing essay to reflect a specific voice you've chosen, helping you understand how voice impacts your writing's effectiveness.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Choose Your Voice\nSelect one of the following voices for your revision:\n- **Academic/Formal**: Scholarly, objective, sophisticated vocabulary\n- **Conversational**: Friendly, relatable, uses contractions and everyday language\n- **Persuasive**: Confident, compelling, uses rhetorical techniques\n- **Reflective**: Thoughtful, introspective, personal\n- **Humorous**: Light-hearted, witty, entertaining\n\n### Step 2: Revise Your Essay\nTake an essay you've previously written and revise it to reflect your chosen voice. Consider these elements:\n\n- **Word choice**: Select vocabulary that matches your voice\n- **Sentence structure**: Vary length and complexity to suit your voice\n- **Tone**: Adjust how you address the reader\n- **Literary devices**: Add metaphors, analogies, or other techniques that enhance your voice\n- **Transitions**: Modify how you connect ideas\n\n### Step 3: Highlight Your Changes\nUse highlighting, bold text, or another method to clearly indicate the changes you've made to your original essay. This will help your assessor understand your revision process.\n\n### Step 4: Write Your Rationale\nCompose a 50-word rationale explaining why you chose this particular voice and how your specific changes enhance the effectiveness of your essay. Be concise but specific about your choices.\n\n## Example\n\n**Original sentence**: \"The data indicates that climate change is affecting global weather patterns.\"\n\n**Revised (Conversational voice)**: \"Let's face it - the numbers don't lie. Our climate is changing, and it's messing with weather all over the world.\"\n\n**Rationale excerpt**: \"I chose a conversational voice to make complex climate information more accessible to general readers. By using contractions and everyday language, I've created a more engaging and relatable explanation.\"\n\n## Submission Requirements\n1. Your revised essay with changes clearly highlighted\n2. Your 50-word rationale for voice choices\n3. A copy of your original essay for comparison\n\nRemember that effective voice creates a connection with your reader and enhances your message. Your revision should maintain the original content while transforming how that content is expressed.",
