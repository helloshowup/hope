Then, you'll engage with a classmate's solution by commenting on their analysis.\n\n### The Stalled Paragraph\n\nRead the following paragraph that a writer is struggling to develop further:\n\n> I want to write about the impact of social media on teenagers today. Social media has both good and bad effects. Teenagers use platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Some people think it's harmful, while others see benefits. It's complicated and there are many opinions about this topic.\n\n### Your Task:\n\n1. **Diagnose the Problem**: Identify which stage of the writing process (brainstorming, drafting, revising, or editing) appears to have failed or stalled. Explain your reasoning with specific evidence from the paragraph.\n\n2. **Suggest Next Actions**: Provide at least three specific, actionable steps the writer could take to move forward with their writing.\n\n3. **Peer Engagement**: After posting your analysis, read and respond to at least one classmate's solution. Comment on the effectiveness of their diagnosis and suggestions. Do you agree with their assessment? Would you add any additional recommendations?\n\n### Grading Criteria:\n- Accurate identification of the stalled writing process stage with clear evidence (30%)\n- Quality and specificity of recommended actions (40%)\n- Thoughtful engagement with a peer's analysis (30%)\n\n### Example Response Format:\n\n**Diagnosis**: [Identify the stalled stage of the writing process]\n\n**Evidence**: [Point to specific aspects of the paragraph that support your diagnosis]\n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n- [Action 1]\n- [Action 2]\n- [Action 3]\n\n**Response to [Peer's Name]**: [Your thoughtful commentary on a classmate's analysis]\n\n### Time Management Tip:\nThis activity should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete: 15-20 minutes for your analysis and 15-25 minutes to review and respond to a peer's work.\n\nRemember to apply what you've learned about the writing process to provide meaningful analysis and constructive suggestions!",
  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the assignment's clarity, structure, and educational effectiveness:\n\n1. Added clear grading criteria with percentage breakdowns so students understand how their work will be evaluated\n2. Included a time management tip to help students plan their work, especially important for asynchronous learners juggling multiple responsibilities\n3. Maintained the original core instructions while adding structural elements that support self-paced learning\n4. Preserved the example response format which provides clear scaffolding\n5. Enhanced the formatting to improve readability and visual organization\n\nThese changes align with Excel High School's instructional design principles, particularly \"Self-Direction Aids,\" \"Flexibility WITH Structure,\" and \"Scaffold & Spiral\" approaches. The additions support both traditional achievers who need clear structure and adult learners who benefit from practical time management guidance."
