Self-reflection is a powerful tool that helps you recognize your growth, identify challenges, and set meaningful goals for improvement. This activity will guide you through creating a thoughtful reflection on your writing progress.\n\n## Purpose\nThis reflection serves several important purposes:\n- Helps you recognize your writing strengths and achievements\n- Identifies areas where you're experiencing challenges\n- Establishes clear goals for the second half of the module\n- Creates a record of your writing development that you can refer back to\n\n## Reflection Prompts\nUse the following prompts to guide your reflection. You don't need to answer every question, but use them to inspire thoughtful consideration of your writing journey:\n\n**Progress:**\n- What writing skills have you improved since beginning this module?\n- Which assignment or activity has been most valuable to your development as a writer?\n- What specific writing techniques have you successfully implemented?\n\n**Challenges:**\n- What aspects of writing continue to be difficult for you?\n- When do you find yourself getting stuck or frustrated in your writing process?\n- What writing habits would you like to change?\n\n**Goals:**\n- What specific writing skills do you want to focus on improving?\n- What strategies will you implement to overcome your identified challenges?\n- What do you hope to accomplish by the end of this module?\n\n## Assignment Instructions\n1. Create a reflection entry of approximately 250 words based on the prompts above.\n2. Be honest and specific in your self-assessment.\n3. Include concrete examples from your writing assignments when possible.\n4. Submit your completed reflection through the \"Mid-Module Reflection\" assignment in your Student Portal.\n\n## Submission Tips\n- This reflection is for your personal growth and will only be viewed by your instructor.\n- You can use the BRYTE AI Tutor if you need help organizing your thoughts.\n- Remember to save your work frequently as you write.\n- Set a 20-30 minute timer to help manage your time effectively for this task.\n\n## Grading\nThis reflection will be evaluated on completion and thoughtfulness, not writing mechanics. The goal is honest self-assessment that will help guide your progress through the remainder of the module.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several targeted improvements to enhance the content for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Added clarity to the submission process by specifying exactly where to submit the reflection (\"through the 'Mid-Module Reflection' assignment in your Student Portal\") rather than the vague \"private journal within the learning platform.\"\n\n2. Added a \"Submission Tips\" section that:\n   - Clarifies privacy concerns (only instructor will see it)\n   - References Excel-specific resources like BRYTE AI Tutor\n   - Provides practical tips on saving work and time management\n\n3. Added a \"Grading\" section to set clear expectations about assessment criteria, emphasizing that honest reflection is valued over writing mechanics.\n\nThese changes align with the learner profile by:\n- Providing clear structure for self-pacing (Traditional Achievers)\n- Offering confidence-building through explicit expectations (Adult Diploma Seekers)\n- Including time management suggestions (helpful across segments)\n- Referencing Excel-specific tools like BRYTE AI Tutor and the Student Portal\n- Maintaining flexibility while adding structure (key instructional design driver)"
