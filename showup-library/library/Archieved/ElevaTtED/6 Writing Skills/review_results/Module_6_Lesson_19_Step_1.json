By systematically reviewing your work, you can identify patterns in your writing errors and improve your skills over time. This lesson will guide you through a structured approach to proofreading your portfolio pieces.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Implement a systematic proofreading process\n- Track and categorize writing errors\n- Analyze patterns in your writing mistakes\n- Develop strategies to address recurring issues\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Your portfolio drafts (digital or printed)\n- Proofreading Tracker spreadsheet (provided in the Resources section)\n- Colored pens or digital highlighting tools\n\n## Step 1: Access Your Proofreading Tracker\nBegin by downloading the Proofreading Tracker spreadsheet from the Resources section below. This tool will help you document errors, corrections, and patterns in your writing.\n\n**Resources:**\n- [Proofreading Tracker (Google Sheets)](link-to-tracker)\n- [How to Use the Tracker (2-minute video tutorial)](link-to-video)\n\nThe tracker includes columns for:\n- Draft name/number\n- Page/paragraph location\n- Error found\n- Correction made\n- Error category (grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.)\n\n## Step 2: Systematic Draft Review\nFor each draft in your portfolio:\n\n**First Pass:** Read through once for overall flow and content\n- Set a timer for 15-20 minutes\n- Focus on understanding your own writing as if you were a new reader\n- Resist the urge to make corrections at this stage\n\n**Second Pass:** Review specifically for errors\n- Mark each error you find directly on the draft\n- Use different symbols or colors for different types of errors\n- Record each error and correction in your tracker\n\n**Pro Tip:** Review your drafts in different formats (printed vs. digital) and at different times of day to catch more errors. Many Excel High School students find that reading their work aloud helps identify awkward phrasing and run-on sentences.\n\n## Step 3: Track Your Error Patterns\nIn your tracker:\n- Highlight errors you found independently in one color\n- Use a different color for errors pointed out by peers or instructors\n- Note which corrections came easily and which required research\n\nThis distinction helps you understand your proofreading strengths and blind spots.\n\n**Example:**\n| Draft | Location | Error | Correction | Category | Found By |\n|-------|----------|-------|------------|----------|----------|\n| Essay 1 | Para 2 | \"their going\" | \"they're going\" | Grammar | Self |\n| Essay 1 | Para 4 | Missing citation | Added source | Citation | Instructor |\n\n## Step 4: Analyze and Address Recurring Issues\nAfter reviewing all drafts:\n1. Sort your tracker by error category\n2. Count the frequency of each error type\n3. Identify your top three recurring issues\n4. For each issue, list one specific strategy to improve\n\n**Self-Check Questions:**\n- What types of errors do I consistently miss?\n- What time of day am I most effective at proofreading?\n- Which resources help me most with my common errors?\n\n## Practice Activity\nSelect one of your portfolio pieces and apply the full proofreading process. Record at least 10 errors in your tracker, then identify any patterns. \n\n**Discussion Forum Task:** Share your top three recurring issues and one strategy for addressing each in the class discussion forum. Respond to at least two classmates with additional strategy suggestions.\n\n## Assessment\nYour completed Proofreading Tracker with at least three drafts analyzed and a one-paragraph summary of your top three recurring issues will demonstrate your mastery of this lesson.\n\n**Submission Instructions:**\n1. Complete your Proofreading Tracker with at least 3 drafts\n2. Write a 150-200 word summary of your error patterns and improvement strategies\n3. Submit both files through the assignment portal\n\n## Need Help?\n- Visit the Excel High School Writing Lab for personalized assistance\n- Schedule time with your Success Coach to review your error patterns\n- Use the BRYTE AI Tutor for immediate grammar and punctuation guidance\n\nRemember: Effective proofreading is not just about fixing errors\u2014it's about recognizing patterns and improving your writing process over time.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational value for Excel High School students:\n\n1.

Added an example table to show how to use the tracker\n4. Included self-check questions to promote metacognition\n5. Added specific submission instructions with word count guidelines\n6. Created a \"Need Help?\" section that references Excel High School's specific support resources (Writing Lab, Success Coach, BRYTE AI Tutor)\n7. Improved formatting with more consistent headers and better visual organization\n8. Added more specific guidance for the discussion forum task\n9. Included a note about reading work aloud, which is a practical strategy for self-paced learners\n\nThese changes better align with Excel High School's instructional design drivers, particularly \"Self-Direction Aids,\" \"Flexibility WITH Structure,\" and \"Mastery-Led Feedback\" as outlined in the learner profile."
