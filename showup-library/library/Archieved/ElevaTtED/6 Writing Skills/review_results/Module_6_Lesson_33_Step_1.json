This quiz will help you distinguish between surface-level and deep reflection, and identify strategies to enhance your reflective practice.\n\n## Writing Sample Classification\n\nRead the following four excerpts and determine whether each represents **surface-level reflection** or **deep reflection**:\n\n1. \"I finished my essay on time and used proper grammar throughout.\"\n   * This is an example of: _____\n\n2. \"While revising, I noticed my arguments lacked supporting evidence. This pattern appears in my previous essays too, revealing my tendency to make claims without sufficient backup. Next time, I'll gather more research before drafting.\"\n   * This is an example of: _____\n\n3. \"The conclusion of my paper summarizes the main points as required.\"\n   * This is an example of: _____\n\n4. \"I struggled with organization, which made my analysis seem disconnected. This helped me realize I need to outline more thoroughly before writing, especially when dealing with complex topics.\"\n   * This is an example of: _____\n\n## Improving Your Reflection Process\n\nWhich strategies would help deepen your reflection on your writing?

  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance the educational effectiveness of this reflection quiz:\n\n1. Added an introduction that explains the purpose and value of reflection, providing context for learners.\n\n2. Modified the format of the classification questions to make it clearer that students need to provide an answer for each example.\n\n3. Added an application exercise that moves students beyond identification to actual practice of deep reflection, supporting the transfer of learning to their own work.\n\n4. Improved the overall structure with clearer section headings and instructions.\n\n5. Added a text entry box indicator for the application exercise to make it clear where students should respond.\n\nThese changes support Excel High School's instructional design drivers, particularly \"Scaffold & Spiral\" by building from identification to application, and \"Real-World Choice\" by connecting the content to students' own writing experiences. The modifications also better address the needs of diverse learner segments, especially \"Second-Chance Learners\" who benefit from clear structure and small wins."
