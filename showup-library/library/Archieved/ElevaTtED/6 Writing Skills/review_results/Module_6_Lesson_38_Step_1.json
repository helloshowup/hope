  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the educational effectiveness of this content:\n\n1. Added a clear \"Learning Objective\" section to help students understand the purpose of the activity\n2. Expanded the \"Success Criteria\" section to replace the brief reminder, providing more specific guidance on expectations\n3. Added a \"Need Help?\" section to connect with Excel High School's support resources (Success Coach, Writing Lab)\n4. Maintained the core matching exercise while improving the framing around it\n5. Reorganized the content to follow a more logical flow: objective \u2192 activity \u2192 success criteria \u2192 support\n6. Preserved all original portfolio sections and evidence items while enhancing the instructional scaffolding\n\nThese changes align with the Excel High School learner profile by providing clearer structure for self-pacing students, supporting \"second-chance\" learners who need scaffolding, and incorporating UDL principles through multiple means of engagement and support."
