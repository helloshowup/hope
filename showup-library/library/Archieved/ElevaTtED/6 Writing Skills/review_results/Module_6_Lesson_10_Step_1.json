  "reviewed_content": "# Structure Rubric\n\n## Understanding the Auto-Checker Evaluation\n\nWhen you submit your essay, our auto-checker will evaluate three key structural elements:\n\n1. **Thesis Clarity**: Your thesis statement must clearly present your main argument and appear in your introduction paragraph.\n\n2. **Paragraph Unity**: Each body paragraph must focus on a single main idea that supports your thesis, with appropriate transitions between paragraphs to guide your reader.\n\n3. **Conclusion Strength**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a new way that reinforces your argument.\n\n## Passing Requirements\n\nTo pass the structure assessment, your essay must have **no more than 2 issues** across these three categories. \n\n**Example:** If your thesis is somewhat unclear (1 issue) and one paragraph lacks unity (1 issue), but your conclusion is strong, you would still pass with 2 total issues.\n\n## Success Tips\n\nBefore submitting your essay, use this checklist:\n- Is my thesis statement clearly stated in my introduction?\n- Does each paragraph focus on one main idea with supporting details?\n- Have I included transitions between paragraphs?\n- Does my conclusion summarize my key points and restate my thesis in a fresh way?\n\nRemember, you can use the Excel Writing Lab for additional support if needed!",
  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve clarity, engagement, and educational value:\n\n1. Added more specific details to each structural element (e.g., \"in your introduction paragraph,\" \"body paragraph,\" \"to guide your reader\") to provide clearer guidance.\n\n2. Expanded the explanation of conclusion strength to emphasize the purpose (\"reinforces your argument\").\n\n3. Added a new \"Success Tips\" section with a practical checklist format that helps students self-assess before submission.\n\n4. Included a reminder about the Excel Writing Lab resource to provide additional support options.\n\n5. Improved formatting with more white space and clearer organization to enhance readability for all learner segments, particularly beneficial for \"Second-Chance Learners\" and \"Adult Diploma Seekers\" who may need additional scaffolding.\n\nThese changes maintain the original information while providing more actionable guidance and support for the diverse Excel High School learner population."
