This tutorial will guide you through creating a comprehensive four-year plan using Google Sheets that will help you visualize your academic path.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n- Create a color-coded semester plan in Google Sheets\n- Implement conditional formatting to track prerequisites\n- Balance your course workload across semesters\n- Design a personalized course plan that supports your goals and interests\n\n## Step-by-Step Tutorial\n\n### 1. Setting Up Your Google Sheet\n\n1. Open Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet\n2. Title your spreadsheet \"My Four-Year High School Plan\"\n3. Create the following column headers:\n   - Course Name\n   - Credits\n   - Prerequisites\n   - Grade 9 (Fall/Spring)\n   - Grade 10 (Fall/Spring)\n   - Grade 11 (Fall/Spring)\n   - Grade 12 (Fall/Spring)\n\n### 2. Color-Coding Your Semesters\n\n1. Select all semester columns (Grade 9-12, Fall/Spring)\n2. Apply alternating colors to distinguish semesters:\n   - Fall semesters: Light blue (#D0E2F3)\n   - Spring semesters: Light green (#D8E4BC)\n   \n*Pro Tip: Color-coding makes it easier to visualize your course distribution across the academic year.*\n\n### 3. Setting Up Prerequisite Checks with Conditional Formatting\n\n1. Select your spreadsheet and click Format \u2192 Conditional formatting\n2. Set up a rule that will highlight cells in red when a course is placed before its prerequisite:\n   - Apply to range: Select your course placement cells\n   - Format rules: Choose \"Custom formula is\"\n   - Enter a formula that checks if a prerequisite exists in a later semester\n   - Format: Red fill (#FF9999)\n\n*Example Formula:* \n```\n=AND(NOT(ISBLANK(B2)),ISBLANK(INDIRECT(\"D\"&ROW())))\n```\n\n### 4. Balancing Your Workload\n\n1. Create a row at the bottom of each semester column labeled \"Total Credits\"\n2. Use the SUM function to calculate credits per semester\n3. Apply conditional formatting to highlight:\n   - Green (<= 7 credits): Balanced workload\n   - Yellow (8 credits): Potentially challenging\n   - Red (> 8 credits): Consider redistributing courses\n\n### 5. Final Touches and Optimization\n\n1. Add a \"Notes\" column to track your thoughts about each course\n2. Create a \"Graduation Requirements\" checklist on a separate tab\n3. Set up a dashboard showing your progress toward graduation requirements\n\n## Practice Activity\n\nNow it's your turn to build your four-year plan:\n\n1. List all required courses for graduation\n2. Add electives that align with your interests and goals\n3. Distribute courses across semesters, watching for prerequisite warnings\n4. Balance your workload by aiming for 6-7 credits per semester\n5. Review and adjust your plan to ensure it supports your post-graduation goals\n\nRemember, this plan is flexible and can be adjusted as your interests evolve throughout high school.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour four-year plan is a powerful tool for visualizing your high school journey. By using color-coding, prerequisite checks, and workload balancing, you've created a roadmap that will help you achieve your academic goals while maintaining a healthy school-life balance.",
