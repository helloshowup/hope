Today, I'll guide you through completing a Google Form that helps identify your strengths, interests, and values. This information will be valuable for your college planning process, as it helps align your future educational and career choices with who you are as a person.\n\n## What We'll Cover\n\n1. Completing each section of the self-assessment inventory\n2. Understanding what each category measures\n3. Interpreting your results through a radar chart\n4. Creating an insight statement based on your findings\n\n## The Self-Assessment Process\n\n### Strengths Inventory\n\nIn this first section, you'll rate yourself on various abilities and skills. For example, I'm completing questions about my analytical thinking, creativity, and communication skills. For each item, consider how naturally these abilities come to you, not just whether you enjoy them.\n\nWhen I rate myself on \"solving complex problems,\" I'm thinking about how I approach challenges in different contexts. I'll give myself a 4 out of 5 because I consistently find effective solutions, though sometimes need to work through multiple approaches.\n\n### Interests Inventory\n\nNow we're moving to the interests section. Here, you'll indicate your level of interest in various activities and subjects. Notice how these questions focus on what you enjoy doing, not necessarily what you're good at.\n\nI'm rating my interest in \"designing or creating things\" as a 5 because I genuinely enjoy creative projects. For \"analyzing data,\" I'll select a 3 since I appreciate understanding information but don't seek out data analysis as a primary activity.\n\n### Values Assessment\n\nIn this final section, you'll prioritize what matters most to you in your future education and career. These questions help identify what would make a workplace or college experience fulfilling for you.\n\nI'm rating \"helping others\" as highly important to me, while \"financial security\" is moderately important. There are no right or wrong answers here\u2014just honest reflections of what you value.\n\n## Interpreting Your Results\n\nOnce you submit the form, you'll receive a radar chart like this one showing your scores across different dimensions. The further the point extends outward on any axis, the stronger that area is for you.\n\nLooking at my chart, I notice my highest scores are in creative and interpersonal areas, while my technical and computational scores are lower. This visual representation helps identify patterns you might not otherwise notice.\n\n## Creating Your Insight Statement\n\nBased on these results, I'll now model creating a two-sentence insight statement:\n\n\"My self-assessment reveals that I have strong creative and interpersonal strengths, coupled with a high value placed on helping others and work-life balance. These patterns suggest I might thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply creative problem-solving to assist others, such as education, counseling, or community program development.\"\n\nYour insight statement should connect what you've learned about yourself to potential educational or career directions that align with your profile.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis self-assessment provides valuable information for your college planning process. Remember that this is just one tool to help you reflect on your path forward. Use these insights as you research college programs and potential careers that might be a good fit for who you are.",
