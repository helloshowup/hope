This reflective exercise is designed to help you track your growth in confidence related to your educational and career decisions. By regularly assessing your confidence levels, you can identify areas for improvement and create actionable steps to strengthen your decision-making abilities.\n\n## Comparing Your Confidence Scores\n\nNow that you've completed your first few weeks in the College Prep course, it's time to revisit your confidence assessment. This exercise builds upon the foundation you established in Week 1 when you first evaluated your confidence levels across various aspects of educational and career planning.\n\n### Reflection Task\n\nTake a moment to review your Week 1 confidence scores. In your journal entry, please address the following:\n\n1. **Compare Your Scores**: How do your current confidence levels compare to those from Week 1? Are there areas where you've seen improvement? Areas where your confidence has decreased?\n\n2. **Identify Growth Opportunity**: Based on your comparison, identify ONE specific area where you would most like to build greater confidence. This might be an area where:\n   - Your score is lower than you'd like\n   - You've seen a decrease since Week 1\n   - You feel improvement would significantly impact your educational journey\n\n3. **Set a Specific Action**: Develop ONE concrete, actionable step you will take in the next week to improve your confidence in this area. Your action should be:\n   - Specific and clearly defined\n   - Measurable (how will you know you've completed it?)\n   - Achievable within one week\n   - Relevant to building confidence in your chosen area\n\n## Example Journal Entry\n\n*Here's an example of what your journal entry might look like:*\n\n> **Confidence Comparison**: When I compare my Week 1 scores to today, I notice my confidence in researching college options has increased from a 5 to a 7. However, my confidence in financial planning for college has decreased from a 6 to a 4, likely because I've realized how complex this area is.\n> \n> **Growth Area**: I want to focus on improving my confidence in financial planning for college.\n> \n> **Specific Action**: By next week, I will spend 30 minutes each day researching scholarship opportunities and will complete at least two scholarship applications. I'll also schedule a meeting with my school counselor to discuss financial aid options.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n1. Create your journal entry addressing all three required elements.\n2. Your entry should be approximately 200-300 words.\n3. Submit your entry through the course platform by the assigned deadline.\n\n## Optional Peer Engagement\n\nAfter submitting your journal entry, you're encouraged (but not required) to:\n\n1. Read at least two of your classmates' journal entries\n2. Leave thoughtful comments that might include:\n   - Encouragement for their chosen action step\n   - Additional suggestions for building confidence in their growth area\n   - Sharing a resource that might help them\n\nRemember, this journal is a personal tool for your growth. Be honest in your self-assessment and intentional about your improvement actions. Your commitment to this reflective practice will strengthen your confidence in making important educational and career decisions.\n\n*How has tracking your confidence helped you become more aware of your decision-making process so far?*",
