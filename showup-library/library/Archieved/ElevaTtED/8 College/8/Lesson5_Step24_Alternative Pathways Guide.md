# Alternative Pathways Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our Alternative Pathways Guide! At Excel High School, we understand that traditional educational journeys don't fit everyone's needs and circumstances. This guide outlines several alternative routes to achieving your educational goals, whether you're looking to complete your high school education, recover credits, or build credentials at your own pace.

## GED Track

The General Educational Development (GED) test provides an alternative path to earning a high school equivalency credential recognized by employers and colleges nationwide.

**Key Features:**
- Four subject tests: Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts
- Flexible preparation options (online courses, in-person classes, self-study)
- Testing available year-round at designated centers
- Passing score demonstrates high school-level academic skills

**Excel GED Preparation Resources:**
- GED-aligned practice materials with multimedia learning options
- Subject-specific tutoring with our Success Coaches
- Practice test assessments with detailed feedback
- Personalized study plans that adapt to your progress

## Credit Recovery Options

If you've fallen behind in credits needed for graduation, our credit recovery program offers solutions to get back on track without starting over.

**Options Available:**
- Accelerated courses focused on essential standards
- Self-paced learning modules with mastery-based progression
- Summer term credit recovery sessions
- Extended day programs with flexible scheduling

**Benefits:**
- Targeted instruction in areas of difficulty
- Flexible scheduling to accommodate work or family responsibilities
- One-on-one support from recovery specialists and BRYTE AI Tutor
- Progress monitoring and regular check-ins through your Student Portal

## Stackable Micro-Credentials

Build your qualifications step by step with our micro-credential program, allowing you to earn certificates that stack toward larger credentials and demonstrate real-world skills.

**How It Works:**
1. Complete individual skill modules at your own pace
2. Earn digital badges for demonstrated competencies
3. Stack related badges into recognized certificates
4. Apply credentials toward diploma requirements or career advancement

**Popular Micro-Credential Pathways:**
- Digital Literacy (including coding, data analysis, and digital citizenship)
- Career Readiness (resume building, interview skills, workplace communication)
- Financial Literacy (budgeting, investing, credit management)
- Communication Skills (writing, public speaking, collaboration)
