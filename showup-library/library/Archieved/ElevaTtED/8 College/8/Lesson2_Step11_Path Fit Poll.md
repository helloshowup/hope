# Path Fit Poll

# Path Fit Poll

Now that you've explored different educational and career paths, it's time to reflect on what you've learned and identify which path might be the best fit for you.

Please complete this brief 5-item poll to help solidify your thoughts:

1. **Which path (Traditional College, Career/Technical Education, Military, or Workforce) most appeals to you at this point?**
   * Consider your interests, values, and learning style when making your selection.

2. **What specific aspects of this path align with your personal strengths?**
   * Think about your academic abilities, practical skills, social preferences, and work habits.

3. **What potential challenges might you face on this path, and how could you address them?**
   * Every path has obstacles - identifying them now helps you prepare strategies for success.

4. **How does your chosen path connect to your long-term goals?**
   * Reflect on how this path creates opportunities for your future career, lifestyle, and personal growth.

5. **What additional information would help you feel more confident about this path?**
   * Identify specific questions you still have or resources you need to explore.

**Note:** Please provide a thoughtful response for each question (3-5 sentences recommended). Your reflections will help you synthesize what you've learned and create a foundation for your next steps.

Once you submit your responses, the next lesson will be unlocked. Remember, this is not a final decision - your path may evolve as you continue to learn and grow!

**Time to complete:** Approximately 15-20 minutes
