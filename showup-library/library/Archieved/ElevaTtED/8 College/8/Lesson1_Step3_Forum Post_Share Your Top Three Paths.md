# Forum Post—Share Your Top Three Paths

## Discussion Prompt

### Instructions:

   - Your top three potential college majors or career paths
   - For each major/career, include 1-2 sentences explaining why you're interested in this path

"My top three paths are:
1. Psychology - I'm fascinated by understanding human behavior and how the mind works. I'd like to eventually help people overcome mental health challenges.
2. Business Administration - I enjoy leadership roles and want to develop skills to manage organizations effectively. My experience in student government has shown me I have a talent for organizing people and projects.
