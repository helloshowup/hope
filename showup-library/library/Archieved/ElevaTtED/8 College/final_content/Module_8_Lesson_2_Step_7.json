Understanding how different majors connect to various career paths can help you make informed choices about your future. This lesson introduces you to several powerful tools that will help you explore these connections and understand important factors like salary potential, job growth, and required skills.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Use career exploration tools to research potential career paths\n- Interpret career metrics like salary data and job growth projections\n- Connect specific majors to related career opportunities\n- Create a personalized career-major map based on your interests\n\n## Career Exploration Tools\n\n### O*NET OnLine\n\n[O*NET OnLine](https://www.onetonline.org/) is a comprehensive database sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor that provides detailed information about occupations.\n\n![O*NET Interface](https://www.onetonline.org/image/home/onet.png)\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Career exploration by skills, interests, or industry\n- Detailed job descriptions and required skills\n- Education requirements for specific careers\n- Salary information and job outlook\n\n> **Pro Tip:** Use O*NET's \"My Next Move\" feature to take an interest assessment that matches your preferences to potential careers.\n\n### Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\n\nThe [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) provides authoritative data on employment, wages, and job projections.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Occupational Outlook Handbook with detailed career information\n- Employment projections for the next decade\n- Regional and industry-specific data\n- Comprehensive wage information\n\n![BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/images/ooh-home.png)\n\n> **Important Metric:** The BLS provides \"Job Outlook\" percentages that show projected growth rates for occupations over a 10-year period. Growth rates above 7% are considered faster than average.\n\n### University Program Finders\n\nMany universities offer program finder tools that help connect majors to potential careers.\n\n**Examples:**\n- [MyMajors](https://www.mymajors.com/)\n- [BigFuture Major and Career Search](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors-careers)\n- Individual university career services websites\n\n![Sample University Program Finder](https://www.mymajors.com/assets/images/quiz-results.png)\n\n## Understanding Career Metrics\n\n### Salary Information\n\nWhen researching careers, you'll encounter various salary metrics:\n\n| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |\n|--------|------------|----------------|\n| **Median Salary** | The middle point where half of workers earn more and half earn less | Gives you the most realistic picture of typical earnings |\n| **Entry-Level Salary** | What you might expect to earn when first entering the field | Helps with short-term financial planning |\n| **Experienced Salary** | What you might earn after gaining experience | Shows potential for growth over time |\n| **Regional Variations** | How salaries differ based on location | Important for deciding where to live and work |\n\n### Job Growth Projections\n\nGrowth metrics help you understand the future demand for specific careers:\n\n| Growth Category | 10-Year Projection | What This Means For You |\n|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Declining** | Negative growth percentage | Jobs may be harder to find; consider related fields |\n| **Average** | 3-7% growth | Stable job market with typical turnover |\n| **Faster than average** | 8-14% growth | Good opportunities for new graduates |\n| **Much faster than average** | 15% or higher growth | High demand for qualified candidates |\n\n### Skills Demand\n\nUnderstanding which skills are in demand can help you prepare for your chosen career:\n\n- **Hard Skills:** Technical abilities specific to a job (programming languages, equipment operation, certification knowledge)\n- **Soft Skills:** Interpersonal abilities valued across industries (communication, teamwork, problem-solving)\n- **Emerging Skills:** New abilities becoming important in your field (often technology-related)\n\n## Checkpoint: Quick Knowledge Check\n\nBefore moving on to the activity, test your understanding:\n\n1. What's the difference between median salary and entry-level salary?\n2. If a career has a 12% growth projection, how would the BLS categorize this growth?\n3. Name one key feature of O*NET that helps connect your interests to potential careers.\n\n## Activity: Career-Major Mapping\n\n**Instructions:** Complete this activity to create a personalized career-major map.\n\n1. Choose two careers that interest you\n2. Use O*NET to identify:\n   - Required education and training\n   - Core skills needed\n   - Related majors\n3. Use the BLS to research:\n   - Salary information\n   - Job outlook\n4. Find a university program finder to identify specific majors that align with these careers\n5. Create a simple table or diagram showing the connections between:\n   - Your interests\n   - Potential majors\n   - Possible careers\n   - Key skills needed\n   - Education requirements\n\n**Reflection Questions:**\n- What surprised you about the connections between majors and careers?\n- Did you discover any new career possibilities you hadn't considered before?\n- Based on your research, what skills should you start developing now?\n\nBy using these powerful tools together, you can create a clearer picture of how your academic choices connect to potential career paths, helping you make more informed decisions about your educational journey.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [CareerOneStop](https://www.careeronestop.org/) - Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor\n- [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) - Detailed career guides\n- Excel High School Career Services - Schedule an appointment with our career counselors for personalized guidance",
