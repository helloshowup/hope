Today, I'll guide you through completing a strengths-interests-values inventory that will help you better understand yourself as you prepare for college and career planning. By the end of this walk-through, you'll be able to interpret your results and create meaningful insight statements about yourself.\n\n## The Self-Assessment Process\n\n### Step 1: Accessing the Inventory\nI'm opening the Google Form titled \"Personal Strengths, Interests, and Values Inventory.\" This form contains three main sections that we'll complete together.\n\n### Step 2: Completing the Strengths Section\nThe first section focuses on your personal strengths. As I answer these questions, I'm considering skills I've developed and natural abilities I possess.\n\n*[Demonstrating on screen]*\nFor example, when asked to rate my problem-solving ability on a scale of 1-5, I'll select 4 because I consistently find solutions to challenges, though I sometimes need time to work through complex problems.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring the Interests Section\nNow we're moving to the interests section. These questions help identify activities and subjects that naturally engage you.\n\n*[Demonstrating on screen]*\nWhen asked about my interest in creative activities, I'll select \"Very Interested\" because I enjoy artistic expression and creating new things. For analytical activities, I'll choose \"Somewhat Interested\" as I appreciate logical thinking but don't always seek it out.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Core Values\nThe values section helps clarify what principles matter most to you in your education and career.\n\n*[Demonstrating on screen]*\nWhen asked how important \"helping others\" is to me, I'll select \"Very Important\" because contributing positively to others' lives gives me satisfaction. For \"financial security,\" I'll choose \"Important\" as stability matters to me, but it's not my primary driver.\n\n### Step 5: Interpreting Your Results\nAfter submitting the form, we receive a radar chart showing our results across all three categories.\n\n*[Pointing to the chart]*\nThe radar chart creates a visual \"footprint\" of your profile. Areas where the shape extends outward represent your stronger preferences or characteristics. Notice how my chart shows greater extension in the \"creativity\" and \"helping others\" sections, while showing moderate extension in \"analytical thinking\" and \"leadership.\"\n\n### Step 6: Creating Your Insight Statement\nBased on these results, I'll now model how to write a two-sentence insight statement:\n\n\"My self-assessment reveals that I value creative expression and making a positive impact on others, which aligns with my strengths in communication and empathy. These patterns suggest I might find fulfillment in careers that combine creative problem-solving with opportunities to support others' growth, such as education, counseling, or community program development.\"\n\n## Conclusion\nRemember, this self-assessment is a starting point for reflection, not a definitive career prescription. Use your results to explore options that align with your unique combination of strengths, interests, and values as you plan your educational and career journey.\n</educational_content>",

This visual representation shows:\n- My strengths are concentrated in problem-solving and leadership\n- My interests lean toward working with people and creative activities\n- My values emphasize work-life balance and making a difference\n\nThe radar chart helps identify patterns across all three areas, showing where they align or diverge.\n\n### Step 6: Creating an Insight Statement\nBased on these results, I'll create a two-sentence insight statement:\n\n\"My assessment reveals I have strong problem-solving and leadership abilities paired with a genuine interest in working with people and creative expression. These qualities, combined with my core values of work-life balance and making a difference, suggest I might thrive in collaborative, purpose-driven roles that allow me to lead initiatives and solve meaningful problems.\"\n\n## Conclusion\nYour completed self-assessment provides valuable insights for college and career planning. Use your personal radar chart and insight statement to guide your exploration of majors and career paths that align with who you are.\n</educational_content>",

Today, I'll guide you through completing a Google Form that helps identify your strengths, interests, and values. This information will be valuable for your college planning process, as it helps align your future educational and career choices with who you are as a person.\n\n## What We'll Cover\n\n1. Completing each section of the self-assessment inventory\n2. Understanding what each category measures\n3. Interpreting your results through a radar chart\n4. Creating an insight statement based on your findings\n\n## The Self-Assessment Process\n\n### Strengths Inventory\n\nIn this first section, you'll rate yourself on various abilities and skills. For example, I'm completing questions about my analytical thinking, creativity, and communication skills. For each item, consider how naturally these abilities come to you, not just whether you enjoy them.\n\nWhen I rate myself on \"solving complex problems,\" I'm thinking about how I approach challenges in different contexts. I'll give myself a 4 out of 5 because I consistently find effective solutions, though sometimes need to work through multiple approaches.\n\n### Interests Inventory\n\nNow we're moving to the interests section. Here, you'll indicate your level of interest in various activities and subjects. Notice how these questions focus on what you enjoy doing, not necessarily what you're good at.\n\nI'm rating my interest in \"designing or creating things\" as a 5 because I genuinely enjoy creative projects. For \"analyzing data,\" I'll select a 3 since I appreciate understanding information but don't seek out data analysis as a primary activity.\n\n### Values Assessment\n\nIn this final section, you'll prioritize what matters most to you in your future education and career. These questions help identify what would make a workplace or college experience fulfilling for you.\n\nI'm rating \"helping others\" as highly important to me, while \"financial security\" is moderately important. There are no right or wrong answers here\u2014just honest reflections of what you value.\n\n## Interpreting Your Results\n\nOnce you submit the form, you'll receive a radar chart like this one showing your scores across different dimensions. The further the point extends outward on any axis, the stronger that area is for you.\n\nLooking at my chart, I notice my highest scores are in creative and interpersonal areas, while my technical and computational scores are lower. This visual representation helps identify patterns you might not otherwise notice.\n\n## Creating Your Insight Statement\n\nBased on these results, I'll now model creating a two-sentence insight statement:\n\n\"My self-assessment reveals that I have strong creative and interpersonal strengths, coupled with a high value placed on helping others and work-life balance. These patterns suggest I might thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply creative problem-solving to assist others, such as education, counseling, or community program development.\"\n\nYour insight statement should connect what you've learned about yourself to potential educational or career directions that align with your profile.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis self-assessment provides valuable information for your college planning process. Remember that this is just one tool to help you reflect on your path forward. Use these insights as you research college programs and potential careers that might be a good fit for who you are.\n</educational_content>"
