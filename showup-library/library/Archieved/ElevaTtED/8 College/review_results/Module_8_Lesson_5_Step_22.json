This reflective exercise helps you track your growth in confidence related to your educational and career decisions. By regularly assessing your confidence levels, you can identify areas for improvement and create actionable steps to strengthen your decision-making abilities.\n\n## Comparing Your Confidence Scores\n\nNow that you've completed your first few weeks in the College Prep course, it's time to revisit your confidence assessment. This exercise builds upon the foundation you established in Week 1 when you first evaluated your confidence levels.\n\n### Reflection Task\n\nTake a moment to review your Week 1 confidence scores. In your journal entry, please address the following:\n\n1. **Compare Your Scores**: How do your current confidence levels compare to those from Week 1? \n   - Which areas show improvement?\n   - Are there areas where your confidence has decreased?\n   - What factors might explain these changes?\n\n2. **Identify Growth Opportunity**: Based on your comparison, identify ONE specific area where you would most like to build greater confidence. This might be an area where:\n   - Your score is lower than you'd like\n   - You've seen a decrease since Week 1\n   - Improvement would significantly impact your educational journey\n\n3. **Set a SMART Action**: Develop ONE concrete, actionable step you will take in the next week to improve your confidence in this area. Your action should be:\n   - **S**pecific: Clearly defined what you'll do\n   - **M**easurable: How will you track completion?\n   - **A**chievable: Realistic within one week\n   - **R**elevant: Directly addresses your confidence area\n   - **T**ime-bound: Set specific times to work on it\n\n## Example Journal Entry\n\n*Here's an example of what your journal entry might look like:*\n\n> **Confidence Comparison**: When comparing my Week 1 scores to today, I notice my confidence in researching college options has increased from a 5 to a 7. I've learned about several helpful college search tools in this course. However, my confidence in financial planning for college has decreased from a 6 to a 4, likely because I've realized how complex this area is.\n> \n> **Growth Area**: I want to focus on improving my confidence in financial planning for college.\n> \n> **Specific Action**: This week, I will:\n> - Spend 20 minutes each day (Monday-Thursday) researching scholarship opportunities\n> - Complete two scholarship applications by Friday\n> - Schedule a 15-minute virtual meeting with my Success Coach to discuss financial aid options\n> - Create a simple spreadsheet to track potential funding sources by Sunday\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n1. Create your journal entry addressing all three required elements.\n2. Your entry should be approximately 200-300 words.\n3. Submit your entry through the course platform by the assigned deadline.\n\n## Optional Peer Engagement\n\nAfter submitting your journal entry, you're encouraged (but not required) to:\n\n1. Read at least two of your classmates' journal entries\n2. Leave thoughtful comments that might include:\n   - Specific encouragement for their chosen action step\n   - Additional suggestions for building confidence in their growth area\n   - Sharing a resource that might help them\n\nRemember, this journal is a personal tool for your growth. Be honest in your self-assessment and intentional about your improvement actions. Your commitment to this reflective practice will strengthen your confidence in making important educational and career decisions.\n\n**Reflection Question:** How has tracking your confidence helped you become more aware of your decision-making process so far? What surprised you most about your confidence assessment?",
  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational effectiveness:\n\n1. Streamlined the introduction to be more direct and action-oriented\n2. Added bullet points to make the reflection tasks more scannable and clear\n3. Expanded the SMART goal framework with a clearer breakdown of each component\n4. Enhanced the example journal entry to be more specific and model better goal-setting\n5. Made the example more detailed by breaking the action into multiple concrete steps\n6. Added a second reflection question at the end to promote deeper thinking\n7. Improved formatting throughout for better readability and visual hierarchy\n8. Adjusted language to be more direct and supportive for diverse learners\n9. Added prompting questions under \"Compare Your Scores\" to guide reflection\n\nThese changes better support the asynchronous learning environment at Excel High School and provide clearer structure for self-paced learners while maintaining flexibility."
