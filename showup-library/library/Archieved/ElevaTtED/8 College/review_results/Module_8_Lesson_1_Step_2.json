Today, I'll guide you through completing a Google Form that helps identify your strengths, interests, and values. This information will be valuable for your college planning process, as it helps align your future educational and career choices with who you are as a person.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n1. Complete each section of the self-assessment inventory\n2. Understand what each category measures\n3. Interpret your results using a radar chart\n4. Create an insight statement based on your findings\n\n## The Self-Assessment Process\n\n### Strengths Inventory\n\nIn this first section, you'll rate yourself on various abilities and skills. For each item, consider how naturally these abilities come to you, not just whether you enjoy them.\n\n**Example:** When rating myself on \"solving complex problems,\" I consider how I approach challenges in different contexts:\n* I'll give myself a 4 out of 5 because I consistently find effective solutions, though sometimes need to work through multiple approaches.\n* Your rating should reflect your honest self-evaluation, not what you think others expect.\n\n### Interests Inventory\n\nNow we're moving to the interests section. Here, you'll indicate your level of interest in various activities and subjects. These questions focus on what you enjoy doing, not necessarily what you're good at.\n\n**Example:** \n* I'm rating my interest in \"designing or creating things\" as a 5 because I genuinely enjoy creative projects. \n* For \"analyzing data,\" I'll select a 3 since I appreciate understanding information but don't seek out data analysis as a primary activity.\n\n### Values Assessment\n\nIn this final section, you'll prioritize what matters most to you in your future education and career. These questions help identify what would make a workplace or college experience fulfilling for you.\n\n**Example:**\n* I'm rating \"helping others\" as highly important to me\n* I'm rating \"financial security\" as moderately important\n* Remember: There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just honest reflections of what you value.\n\n## Interpreting Your Results\n\nAfter submitting the form, you'll receive a radar chart showing your scores across different dimensions. The further a point extends outward on any axis, the stronger that area is for you.\n\n![Example Radar Chart](https://example.com/radar-chart.jpg)\n*Note: This is a sample image. Your actual chart will reflect your personal assessment results.*\n\n**Analyzing Your Chart:**\n* Look for your highest-scoring areas (points furthest from center)\n* Notice patterns or clusters of strengths\n* Consider areas with lower scores and whether they matter for your goals\n\n## Creating Your Insight Statement\n\nBased on your results, create a two-sentence insight statement that connects your self-assessment to potential paths forward.\n\n**Example Statement:**\n\"My self-assessment reveals that I have strong creative and interpersonal strengths, coupled with a high value placed on helping others and work-life balance. These patterns suggest I might thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply creative problem-solving to assist others, such as education, counseling, or community program development.\"\n\n**Your Turn:**\n1. Identify 2-3 key patterns from your assessment\n2. Connect these patterns to potential educational or career directions\n3. Write your two-sentence statement in the provided form field\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Save your radar chart** by downloading it or taking a screenshot\n2. **Keep your insight statement** for reference during college research\n3. **Discuss your results** with your Success Coach or parent/guardian\n4. **Use these insights** as you explore college programs and potential careers\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis self-assessment is one tool in your college planning toolkit. The insights you've gained today will help you make more informed decisions about programs and careers that align with who you are. Remember that self-knowledge is an ongoing process\u2014your strengths, interests, and values may evolve over time.\n\n**Need help?** Contact your Success Coach or use the BRYTE AI Tutor for assistance with interpreting your results.",
