  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the Path Fit Poll for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Added guidance prompts under each question to help students think more deeply about their responses\n2. Expanded the instructions to clarify expectations for response length (3-5 sentences)\n3. Added reassurance that this is not a final decision to reduce pressure\n4. Included an estimated time to complete (15-20 minutes) to help with time management\n5. Improved formatting with bold question numbers and bullet points for better visual organization\n6. Added language that acknowledges the ongoing nature of career exploration (\"your path may evolve\")\n7. Maintained the original questions while making them more specific and actionable\n\nThese changes support Excel's instructional design drivers, particularly \"Self-Direction Aids\" and \"Flexibility WITH Structure\" while making the activity more accessible to all learner segments."
