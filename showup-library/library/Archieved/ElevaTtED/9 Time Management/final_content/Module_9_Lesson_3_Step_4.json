Applying Tags\nTags provide another way to organize and find your files:\n- In most operating systems, you can add tags to files\n- Use consistent tags like \"urgent,\" \"completed,\" \"to review\"\n- Tag by subject, project, or deadline\n\n**Quick Start Guide:**\n* Windows: Right-click file \u2192 Properties \u2192 Details tab \u2192 Tags\n* Mac: Right-click file \u2192 Tags\n* Google Drive: Right-click \u2192 Labels\n\n### 4. Cloud Backup Steps\nProtect your work with automatic cloud backup:\n1. Choose a cloud service (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)\n2. Install the desktop application\n3. Select which folders to sync\n4. Verify automatic backup is working\n5.
