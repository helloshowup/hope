Well-crafted prompts encourage student engagement, critical thinking, and collaborative learning. This lesson will guide you through the process of creating open-ended, specific forum questions that inspire thoughtful responses from your peers.\n\n## Crafting Effective Forum Prompts\n\n### Key Elements of Strong Forum Prompts\n1. **Open-ended structure** - Questions should require more than a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" response\n2. **Specificity** - Prompts should be focused on a particular aspect of the topic\n3. **Relevance** - Questions should connect to course content and student experiences\n4. **Clarity** - Language should be straightforward and easy to understand\n5. **Thought-provoking** - Prompts should stimulate critical thinking and reflection\n\n### Forum Prompt Checklist\nBefore posting your forum prompt, review this checklist:\n- [ ] Does my prompt require more than a one-word or simple answer?\n- [ ] Is my question specific enough to guide responses?\n- [ ] Have I avoided overly broad or vague wording?\n- [ ] Is my prompt clearly connected to our course content?\n- [ ] Will this question generate multiple perspectives?\n- [ ] Is my language clear and free of ambiguity?\n- [ ] Does my prompt invite personal experiences or examples?\n\n## Examples of Strong Forum Prompts\n\n### Example 1: Time Management\n**Weak prompt:** \"What do you think about time management?\"\n*(Too vague, doesn't direct the conversation)*\n\n**Strong prompt:** \"Describe a specific time management strategy that has helped you balance your academic responsibilities with personal commitments. How did you implement this strategy, and what challenges did you face while using it?\"\n*(Open-ended, specific, invites personal experience)*\n\n### Example 2: Study Habits\n**Weak prompt:** \"Do you have good study habits?\"\n*(Closed question, subjective terminology)*\n\n**Strong prompt:** \"Reflect on a study technique you've recently tried. How did this technique affect your understanding of the material compared to your previous approaches? What would you recommend to classmates who might want to try this technique?\"\n*(Specific, reflective, encourages detailed sharing)*\n\n### Example 3: Online Learning\n**Weak prompt:** \"Is online learning good?\"\n*(Overly simplistic, binary framing)*\n\n**Strong prompt:** \"Consider the flexibility of online learning in your educational journey. Share a specific example of how this flexibility has either supported or challenged your learning process, and explain what adjustments you made to adapt.\"\n*(Focused, encourages critical thinking, invites personal examples)*\n\n## Practice Activity\nNow it's your turn! Using the checklist above, craft an engaging forum prompt about time management strategies that would generate meaningful discussion among your peers.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Crafting Effective Forum Prompts\n\n## Introduction\nForum discussions are a valuable way to engage with your peers at Excel High School. The quality of your forum prompts directly impacts the depth and value of the resulting discussions.

What made this technique particularly effective for that specific material?\"\n\n### Example 3: Goal Setting\n\u274c **Weak**: \"Do you set goals?\"  \n\u2705 **Strong**: \"Share one academic goal you've set for this semester at Excel High School. What specific steps are you taking to achieve it, and what obstacles have you encountered so far?\"\n\n## Practice Activity\n\nTry transforming these weak prompts into strong ones:\n1. \"Did you like the reading assignment?\"\n2. \"How do you stay motivated?\"\n3. \"What's your opinion on group projects?\"\n\nRemember, the best forum prompts create space for meaningful exchange of ideas and experiences among Excel High School students!\n</educational_content>",
