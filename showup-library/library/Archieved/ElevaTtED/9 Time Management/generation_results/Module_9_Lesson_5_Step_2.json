This exercise will help you identify which aspects of your life need more attention and create an action plan for improvement.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Complete Your Wheel of Life Chart\n1. Draw a circle and divide it into 8 equal sections (like a pizza).\n2. Label each section with one of these life domains:\n   - Academic Performance\n   - Physical Health\n   - Mental/Emotional Health\n   - Family Relationships\n   - Social Connections\n   - Personal Growth\n   - Recreation/Hobbies\n   - Future Planning\n\n### Step 2: Rate Each Domain\n1. Consider each domain carefully.\n2. Rate your satisfaction in each area on a scale of 1-10 (1 = extremely dissatisfied, 10 = completely satisfied).\n3. Draw a line or shade each section to the corresponding number (like marking a pie chart).\n4. Connect the dots to see your overall \"wheel.\"\n\n### Step 3: Identify Gaps\n1. Look at your completed wheel. Is it balanced or bumpy?\n2. Identify the areas with the lowest scores - these represent gaps in your life balance.\n3. Reflect on why these areas scored low and how they affect other domains.\n4. Choose ONE domain to focus on improving first.\n\n### Step 4: Set a SMART Action Plan\nFor your chosen focus area, create a SMART goal:\n- **Specific**: What exactly do you want to improve?\n- **Measurable**: How will you track progress?\n- **Achievable**: Is this realistic given your current situation?\n- **Relevant**: Why is this important to you?\n- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline for achieving this goal.\n\n### Example\nIf \"Academic Performance\" scored a 4/10, your SMART goal might be:\n\"I will improve my math grade from a C to a B by the end of the quarter by studying 30 minutes daily and attending tutoring twice weekly.\"\n\n### Reflection Questions\n- How does improving this area affect other domains?\n- What resources or support do you need?\n- What obstacles might you face, and how will you overcome them?\n\nRemember, the Wheel of Life is not about achieving perfect 10s in all areas. It's about creating awareness and taking steps toward a more balanced life while managing your academic obligations effectively.\n</educational_content>",

For each section, rate your satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 (1 = completely dissatisfied, 10 = completely satisfied).\n2. Mark your rating on each section, with 1 being close to the center and 10 at the outer edge.\n3. Connect the marks to create your \"wheel.\"\n\n### Step 3: Identify Gaps\n1. Look at your completed wheel. Is it round or bumpy?\n2. Identify the domains with the lowest scores - these represent areas of imbalance.\n3. Reflect on how these imbalances affect your academic performance and overall wellbeing.\n4. Write down 1-2 observations about what your wheel reveals.\n\n### Step 4: Set SMART Focus Actions\nChoose one domain to focus on improving and create a SMART goal:\n- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish\n- **Measurable**: How will you track progress?\n- **Achievable**: Is this realistic given your current situation?\n- **Relevant**: How does this connect to your academic success?\n- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline\n\nExample: \"To improve my Physical Health domain (currently a 4/10), I will exercise for 30 minutes three times per week for the next month.\"\n\n### Step 5: Implementation Plan\n1. Break your SMART goal into smaller weekly actions\n2. Identify potential obstacles and solutions\n3. Determine how you'll track progress\n4. Schedule a review date to reassess your wheel\n\n## Reflection Questions\n- How might improving your lowest-rated domain positively impact your academic performance?\n- What connections do you notice between different domains?\n- How can you maintain balance while prioritizing your academic obligations?\n\nRemember, the Wheel of Life is a tool for awareness and growth. There's no \"perfect\" wheel - the goal is to find a balance that works for your unique situation and supports your academic success.\n</educational_content>",

This exercise will help you identify areas of imbalance between your academic obligations and personal interests, allowing you to create a more harmonious life.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Complete Your Wheel of Life Chart\n1. Draw a circle and divide it into 8 equal sections (like a pizza).\n2. Label each section with one of these life domains:\n   - Academics\n   - Physical Health\n   - Mental Wellbeing\n   - Family Relationships\n   - Social Connections\n   - Personal Interests/Hobbies\n   - Future Goals/Career\n   - Rest/Relaxation\n\n### Step 2: Rate Each Domain\n1. For each section, rate your current satisfaction level on a scale of 1-10 \n   (1 = extremely dissatisfied, 10 = completely satisfied)\n2. Mark your rating on each section, with 1 being close to the center and 10 at the outer edge\n3. Connect the marks to create your \"wheel\"\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Gaps\n1. Look at your completed wheel. Is it balanced or bumpy?\n2. Identify the areas with the lowest scores \u2013 these represent gaps in your life satisfaction\n3. Consider how these low-scoring areas might be affecting higher-scoring areas\n4. Reflect: What would a more balanced wheel look like for you?\n\n### Step 4: Set a SMART Focus Action\nChoose ONE domain to focus on improving first, and create a SMART goal:\n- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish\n- **Measurable**: How will you track progress?\n- **Achievable**: Is this realistic given your current circumstances?\n- **Relevant**: Does this matter to your overall balance?\n- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline\n\nExample: Instead of \"Improve my social life,\" try \"Schedule at least one social activity with friends each week for the next month.\"\n\n## Reflection Questions\n- What surprised you about your wheel?\n- How does academic pressure affect other areas of your life?\n- What small changes could create the biggest positive impact?\n- How might improving one area positively influence others?\n\nRemember that balance doesn't mean giving equal time to all areas, but rather creating harmony that works for YOUR unique situation and priorities.\n</educational_content>"
