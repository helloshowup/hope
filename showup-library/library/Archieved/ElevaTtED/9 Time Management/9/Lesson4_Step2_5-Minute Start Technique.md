# 5-Minute Start Technique

# The 5-Minute Start Technique

## Introduction
Have you ever stared at a task, feeling overwhelmed by where to begin? The 5-Minute Start Technique is a powerful strategy to overcome procrastination by breaking down intimidating tasks into manageable micro-steps. This approach helps you build momentum and reduces the psychological resistance that often prevents us from starting important work.

## Video: Breaking Down the 5-Minute Start

In this video, we demonstrate how to:
1. Identify a task you've been avoiding
2. Break it down into micro-steps that take less than 5 minutes each
3. Commit to completing just the first micro-step
4. Use the momentum to continue or stop after 5 minutes

## Live Timer Exercise

Now it's your turn to apply the 5-Minute Start Technique:

1. **Choose a task** you've been putting off (homework assignment, studying for a test, organizing notes)
2. **Break it down** into tiny first steps (opening your textbook, creating a document, gathering materials)
3. **Set a timer** for just 5 minutes using the built-in timer below or your phone
4. **Begin working** on only the first micro-step
5. When the timer ends, decide whether to continue or stop

### Example Micro-Steps for Excel High School Courses:
- **For an English essay:** Open a document and write just the title or thesis statement
- **For math homework:** Set up your workspace and solve just the first problem
- **For science lab report:** Create the document template with section headings
- **For history research:** Bookmark three potential sources to review later
- **For credit recovery:** Review the module objectives and create a simple checklist

## Reflection Questions

After completing your 5-Minute Start, answer these reflection questions in your learning journal:

1. How did you feel before starting the task? (Rate your resistance level from 1-10)
2. How did you feel during the 5 minutes?
3. Did you notice any change in your resistance to the task?
4. Were you able to continue beyond the 5 minutes? Why or why not?
5. How could you apply this technique to other courses at Excel High School?

## Why This Works

The 5-Minute Start Technique works because it:
- Bypasses the brain's resistance to large, overwhelming tasks
- Creates momentum that often carries you beyond the initial 5 minutes
- Provides a sense of accomplishment even if you only complete the minimum
- Reduces anxiety by making commitment small and manageable
- Builds confidence in your ability to tackle difficult tasks

**Success Coach Tip:** Consider scheduling several 5-minute starts throughout your week for different subjects. Even if you only work for 5 minutes each time, you'll make progress across all your courses!

## Next Steps

1. **Try this technique today** on a task you've been avoiding
2. **Share your experience** in the discussion forum (optional)
3. **Create a "5-Minute Tasks" list** for each of your courses
4. **Check the box below** when you've completed your first 5-minute start

Remember: The hardest part of any task is often just getting started. By committing to just 5 minutes, you overcome the biggest hurdle to productivity and academic success at Excel High School.
