# Portfolio Set-Up

# Time Management Portfolio Setup Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial on setting up your Time Management Portfolio! A well-organized e-portfolio will help you track your time management habits, showcase your progress, and reflect on your growth throughout your Excel High School journey. This guide will walk you through creating portfolio sections, embedding artifacts, implementing version control, and configuring privacy settings.

## Creating E-Portfolio Sections

Your Time Management Portfolio should include these key sections:

1. **Dashboard** - A homepage that introduces your portfolio and time management goals
2. **Time Tracking** - Where you'll document daily/weekly time usage
3. **Goal Setting** - For establishing short and long-term time management objectives
4. **Reflection** - Space for analyzing your progress and challenges
5. **Resources** - Helpful tools and strategies you've discovered

**Activity:** Create each section using descriptive titles and add a brief purpose statement for each. For example, under "Time Tracking," write: "This section documents how I allocate my time and identifies patterns in my daily schedule."

**Tip for Success:** If you're juggling work, family, or other responsibilities, setting up a clear structure now will save you time later and help you stay on track with your Excel High School coursework.

## Embedding Artifacts

Artifacts are evidence of your time management journey. Here's how to embed different types:

**Documents:**
- Upload time logs as PDFs
- Include screenshots of your calendar or planning system
- Add completed to-do lists showing prioritization

**Multimedia:**
- Embed charts/graphs showing time allocation
- Include audio reflections on your progress (2-3 minutes recommended)
- Add video demonstrations of your planning process (keep under 5 minutes)

**Activity:** Create and embed at least three different artifacts that demonstrate your current time management approach. Choose formats that work best for your learning style.

**Need Help?** Visit the Excel High School Student Portal for tutorials on creating and uploading different file types, or contact your Success Coach.

## Version Control

Version control helps you track changes and progress over time:

1. **Naming Convention** - Use consistent file naming: "TimeLog_YYYY-MM-DD"
2. **Revision History** - Keep previous versions of important documents
3. **Progress Tracking** - Create monthly snapshots of your entire portfolio
4. **Changelog** - Maintain a simple log noting what changed and why

**Activity:** Set up a changelog document and record your initial portfolio creation with today's date.

**Quick Win:** Creating a simple changelog now will give you a sense of accomplishment and make it easier to track your progress throughout your Excel High School courses.

## Privacy Settings

Managing privacy ensures your information is appropriately shared:

1. **Public vs. Private** - Decide which sections anyone can view and which remain private
2. **Selective Sharing** - Configure settings to share specific sections with teachers only
3. **Password Protection** - Add passwords to sensitive documents if needed
4. **Attribution** - Properly cite any external resources you include

**Activity:** Configure privacy settings for each section of your portfolio, deciding what information you're comfortable sharing and what should remain private.

**Important Note:** Your Excel High School instructors will need access to your portfolio for assessment purposes. Make sure to grant them appropriate viewing permissions.

## Next Steps

Now that your Time Management Portfolio structure is in place, you'll begin populating it with meaningful content that tracks your habits and demonstrates your organizational growth. Remember to:

- Update your portfolio weekly (set a calendar reminder!)
- Share your progress with your Success Coach
- Apply what you learn about time management to all your Excel High School courses
- Revisit this tutorial whenever you need a refresher

**Remember:** Effective time management is one of the most important skills for success in asynchronous learning environments like Excel High School. Your portfolio will help you develop this critical skill!
