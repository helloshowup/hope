# Choose-Your-Own Scenario

# Choose-Your-Own Scenario: Time Management Plan

## Assignment Overview
In this activity, you will create a 300-word plan addressing a time management scenario of your choice. This exercise helps you practice balancing academic responsibilities with personal interests through authentic decision-making - a critical skill for success at Excel High School and beyond.

## Scenario Options
Choose ONE scenario that best reflects your current challenges:

1. **Academic Crunch**: You have three major assignments due in the same week, plus extracurricular commitments.
2. **Work-School Balance**: You've started a part-time job while maintaining your course load.
3. **Digital Distraction**: You find yourself spending too much time on social media/gaming while falling behind on schoolwork.

## Submission Requirements
1. Write a 300-word plan addressing your chosen scenario
2. Include at least 3 specific time management strategies (such as time blocking, Pomodoro technique, or priority matrices)
3. Outline concrete steps for implementation with a weekly schedule example
4. Explain how you'll balance academic and personal priorities while maintaining well-being

## Self-Reflection Rubric
After completing your plan, rate yourself on:
- Practicality of strategies (1-5): Are these approaches realistic for your situation?
- Specificity of action steps (1-5): Have you included clear, measurable actions?
- Consideration of both academic and personal needs (1-5): Does your plan allow for balance?
- Likelihood of successful implementation (1-5): Be honest - how committed are you to this plan?

## Success Tips
- Review the Time Management module in your Excel Student Orientation
- Consider using the BRYTE AI Tutor if you need help brainstorming strategies
- Remember that small, consistent actions often work better than dramatic changes

Your thoughtful reflection is as important as the plan itself! This assignment will help you develop self-direction skills essential for asynchronous learning success.
