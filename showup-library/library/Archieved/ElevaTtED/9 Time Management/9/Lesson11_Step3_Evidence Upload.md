# Evidence Upload

# Evidence Upload for Time-Management Portfolio

## Objective
In this activity, you will upload two artifacts to your Time-Management Portfolio that demonstrate your progress and learning in developing effective time management skills.

## Instructions
1. **Select Two Artifacts** to upload:
   * A screenshot of your weekly planner/schedule that shows how you're organizing your time
   * Your reflection essay on time management strategies you've implemented

2. **Upload Your Artifacts**:
   * Click the "Upload" button below
   * Select your files from your device
   * Acceptable file formats: .jpg, .png, or .pdf
   * Use descriptive file names (Example: "Weekly_Schedule_October" or "Time_Management_Reflection")

3. **Tag Your Uploads**:
   * Add the tag "learn" to both artifacts
   * This helps organize your portfolio items by purpose and makes them easier to find later

4. **Confirm Uploads**:
   * Verify both files appear in your portfolio view
   * Check that the "learn" tag is visible for each item

## Why This Matters
