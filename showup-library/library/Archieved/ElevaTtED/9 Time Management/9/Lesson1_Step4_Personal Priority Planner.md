# Personal Priority Planner

# Personal Priority Planner

## Introduction
Effective time management is essential for academic success at Excel High School. The Personal Priority Planner is a customizable Google Sheets template designed to help you organize your tasks, set priorities, and manage your time efficiently across daily, weekly, and monthly views.

## Getting Started with Your Personal Priority Planner

### Accessing the Template
1. Click the "Personal Priority Planner Template" link in your Excel Student Portal
2. When prompted, select "Make a copy" to create your own version
3. The planner will automatically save to your Google Drive

### Setting Up the Views
Your planner contains three main views:

**Daily View (Sheet 1)**
- Date column
- Time blocks (hourly from 6 AM to 10 PM)
- Task description field
- Priority level dropdown
- Completion checkbox

**Weekly View (Sheet 2)**
- Days of the week as columns
- Time blocks as rows
- Color-coded priority tasks
- Weekly goals section

**Monthly View (Sheet 3)**
- Calendar grid layout
- Key deadlines and events
- Monthly goals and reflection space

## Using Priority Levels

The planner uses a color-coded priority system:
- **Red (Priority 1)**: Urgent and important tasks (assignment deadlines, exams)
- **Yellow (Priority 2)**: Important but not urgent (study sessions, long-term projects)
- **Green (Priority 3)**: Routine tasks (regular assignments, reading)
- **Blue (Priority 4)**: Optional activities (extracurriculars, social events)

## Pre-filled Formulas for Task Management

The planner includes helpful automatic features:
1. **Task Rolling**: Uncompleted tasks automatically move to the next day
2. **Priority Calculations**: Formulas that count tasks by priority level
3. **Time Tracking**: Automatic calculation of time spent on different priorities
4. **Progress Indicators**: Visual bars showing completion percentages

## Customization Instructions

### Personalizing Your Planner
1. Click on the "Settings" tab
2. Adjust color scheme to your preference
3. Modify priority level descriptions if needed
4. Set your regular commitments (classes, work, family responsibilities, etc.)

### Creating Custom Views
1. Right-click on any sheet tab
2. Select "Duplicate" to create a new view
3. Modify columns and rows as needed
4. Use the formula =IMPORTRANGE() to pull data between sheets (tutorial video available in the Excel Student Resources section)

### Setting Up Notifications
1. Click on Tools > Notification rules
2. Set daily reminders for high-priority tasks
3. Schedule weekly planning sessions
4. Optional: Connect with your Excel Success Coach's calendar for check-ins

## Best Practices for Using Your Planner

1. Begin each week by setting priorities in the weekly view
2. Start each day by reviewing and adjusting your daily plan (5-10 minutes)
3. End each day by checking off completed tasks and reflecting on progress
4. Use the monthly view for long-term planning and tracking Excel course deadlines

### Tips for Different Excel Student Needs:
- **Working Adults**: Block out work hours and family commitments first
- **Credit Recovery Students**: Focus on breaking down assignments into daily tasks
