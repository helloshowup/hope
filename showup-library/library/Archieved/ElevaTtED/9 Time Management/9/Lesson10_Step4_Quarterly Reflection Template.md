1. **Successes**: What specific time management strategies worked well for you this quarter? (Example: using a digital calendar, study blocks, etc.)

2. **Challenges**: What were your biggest time management obstacles this quarter? How did they affect your learning?

3. **Learning**: What have you discovered about when and how you work best? (Consider time of day, environment, break patterns)

4. **Goals**: What are 2-3 specific, measurable time management goals for next quarter? (Example: "Complete assignments 2 days before deadlines")

5. **Strategies**: What new time management techniques will you implement? How will you hold yourself accountable?
