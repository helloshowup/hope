# Digital Filing System Build

## Introduction
Organizing your digital files effectively is a crucial skill in today's academic environment. A well-structured digital filing system helps you locate information quickly, reduces stress, and improves your productivity. This lesson will guide you through creating a personalized digital filing system that works for your needs at Excel High School.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Create a logical folder hierarchy for your academic files
- Apply consistent naming conventions to your documents
- Use tags to enhance searchability
- Set up cloud backup for your important files
- Implement a digital filing template for ongoing organization

## Video Tutorial: Building Your Digital Filing System

[In this video tutorial, we demonstrate how to:
1. Create a main folder structure with categories like "Excel High School Courses," "Personal Projects," and "Resources"
2. Build subfolders for each course or project
3. Establish document categories within each subfolder (Assignments, Notes, Resources)
4. Navigate between folders efficiently
5. View organization examples for different types of students]

## Key Components of Your Digital Filing System

### 1. Folder Hierarchy
Start with broad categories and work down to specifics:
- Excel High School
  - Course 1
    - Assignments
    - Notes
    - Resources
  - Course 2
    - [Same structure]
- Personal Projects
- Important Documents

**Time-Saving Tip:** Setting up this structure now will save you hours of searching for files throughout your academic journey!

### 2. Naming Conventions
Consistent file naming helps you locate documents quickly:
- Use a standard format: Date-Class-AssignmentType-Topic
- Example: 2023-10-15-Algebra-Homework-Equations
- Avoid special characters (? / \ : * " < > |)
- Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces

**Real-World Application:** This skill transfers directly to workplace organization, where clear file naming is essential for team collaboration.

### 3. Applying Tags
Tags provide another way to organize and find your files:
- In most operating systems, you can add tags to files
- Use consistent tags like "urgent," "completed," "to review"
- Tag by subject, project, or deadline

**Quick Start Guide:**
* Windows: Right-click file → Properties → Details tab → Tags
* Mac: Right-click file → Tags
* Google Drive: Right-click → Labels

### 4. Cloud Backup Steps
Protect your work with automatic cloud backup:
1. Choose a cloud service (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
2. Install the desktop application
3. Select which folders to sync
4. Verify automatic backup is working
5. Check backup status regularly

**Pro Tip for Adult Learners:** Set a calendar reminder to verify your backups monthly if you're juggling work and school responsibilities.
