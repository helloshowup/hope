Think about all your tasks for this week (school assignments, work responsibilities, personal commitments, etc.)\n\n3. Place each task in the appropriate quadrant based on:\n   - Its urgency (deadline-driven)\n   - Its importance (contributes to your long-term goals)\n\n4. Upload a screenshot or photo of your completed priority planner.\n   [UPLOAD SCREENSHOT HERE]\n\n5. Reflection (2-3 sentences): What did you notice about where most of your tasks fall?

  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance the learning experience:\n\n1. Added clear learning objectives at the beginning to help students understand the purpose and benefits of the activity.\n\n2. Expanded the activity instructions with step-by-step guidance and added a reflection component to promote deeper thinking about time management.\n\n3. Provided more context about what the priority matrix is and how to create one, rather than assuming prior knowledge.\n\n4. Added a \"Need Help?\" section with specific resources aligned with Excel High School's support systems (Success Coach, BRYTE AI Tutor).\n\n5. Improved the feedback section to be more specific about what students will receive feedback on.\n\n6. Enhanced overall structure with clearer headings and better scaffolding for both traditional achievers and adult learners who may be juggling multiple responsibilities.\n\n7. Made the activity more accessible by providing multiple ways to engage with the content (visual organization, reflection, knowledge check)."
