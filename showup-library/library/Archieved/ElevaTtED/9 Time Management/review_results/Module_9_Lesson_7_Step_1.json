Here's how:\n\n1. **Use time blocks instead of rigid hourly schedules**\n   * Example: \"Morning study block: 2 hours for Math and Science\" rather than \"Math 9-10am, Science 10-11am\"\n\n2. **Build in buffer zones** between important tasks\n   * Add 15-30 minutes between study sessions for unexpected interruptions\n\n3. **Prioritize 2-3 \"must-complete\" daily items**\n   * Identify your non-negotiable academic tasks each day before starting\n\n4. **Create \"flex periods\"** specifically for unexpected tasks\n   * Designate 1-2 hours in your weekly schedule as \"catch-up time\"\n\n5. **Review and adjust** your schedule weekly\n   * Sunday planning: What worked last week? What needs to change?\n\n6. **Set clear boundaries** around non-negotiable commitments\n   * Communicate your dedicated study times to family/friends/employers\n\n## Application Activity\nTake 5 minutes to identify:\n* One area where your schedule is too rigid\n* One area where you need more structure\n* One specific change you'll implement this week\n\nFinding your balance means maintaining commitment to your Excel High School goals while allowing space for life's unpredictability.",
