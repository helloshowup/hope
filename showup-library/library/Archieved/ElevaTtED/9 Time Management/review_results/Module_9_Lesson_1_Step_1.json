Renamed a section to \"Why Time Management Matters for You\" to create a more direct connection\n4. Added interactive elements: a reflection question and a quick check to promote active engagement\n5. Created a new section \"Application to Your Excel High School Journey\" that explicitly addresses different learner segments (traditional students, adult learners, credit recovery students, homeschooling students)\n6. Improved formatting with additional white space and clearer section breaks\n7. Added a \"Your Next Steps\" section to provide clearer direction on course expectations\n\nThese changes align with the school's instructional design drivers, particularly UDL principles, self-direction aids, and flexibility with structure.
