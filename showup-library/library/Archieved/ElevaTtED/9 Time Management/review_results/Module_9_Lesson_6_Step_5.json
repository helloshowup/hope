  "edit_summary": "I made the following improvements to the poll:\n\n1. Added an \"Other\" option to the multiple choice selections to capture nudge types that might not be listed but are valuable to students.\n\n2. Expanded the reflection prompt to explicitly invite suggestions for improvement, encouraging more actionable feedback.\n\n3. Added a time estimate (less than 2 minutes) to set clear expectations and increase completion rates.\n\n4. Added a note explaining how their feedback will directly benefit them as self-directed learners, connecting to the \"Self-Direction Aids\" mentioned in the learner profile.\n\nThese changes maintain the original purpose while making the poll more inclusive, informative, and aligned with the needs of Excel High School's diverse learner segments who rely on effective nudging strategies for asynchronous learning success."
