A list of at least 8 tasks currently on your personal or academic to-do list\n2. Identify which task is your **top priority** and explain why\n3. Select one task you could **delegate** to someone else and explain who and why\n4. Choose one task you could **delay** until later and explain your reasoning\n5. Identify one task you could **delete** completely and explain why it's unnecessary\n\n### Part 2: Peer Response\nRespond thoughtfully to at least two of your classmates' posts by answering these guiding questions:\n- Do you agree with their top priority choice? Why or why not?\n- Would you prioritize their tasks differently? Explain your reasoning.\n- Can you suggest an additional task they might consider delegating, delaying, or deleting?\n- What strategy or tool could you recommend to help them manage their priorities more effectively?\n\n### Example Post\n\"My current tasks include: studying for math exam, washing laundry, calling grandma, organizing desk, finishing English essay, grocery shopping, updating resume, and planning weekend activities. My top priority is the math exam because it's tomorrow. I could delegate grocery shopping to my roommate since they're going anyway. I'll delay organizing my desk until the weekend. I can delete updating my resume since I just got a new job.\"\n\nRemember: The goal is to practice critical thinking about task management and learn from different perspectives on prioritization.",
