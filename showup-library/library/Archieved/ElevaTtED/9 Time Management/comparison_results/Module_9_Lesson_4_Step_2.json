The 5-Minute Start Technique is a powerful strategy to overcome procrastination by breaking down intimidating tasks into manageable micro-steps. This approach helps you build momentum and reduces the psychological resistance that often prevents us from starting important work.\n\n## Video: Breaking Down the 5-Minute Start\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/placeholder\" title=\"5-Minute Start Technique\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIn this video, we demonstrate how to:\n1. Identify a task you've been avoiding\n2. Break it down into micro-steps that take less than 5 minutes each\n3. Commit to completing just the first micro-step\n4. Use the momentum to continue or stop after 5 minutes\n\n## Live Timer Exercise\n\nNow it's your turn to apply the 5-Minute Start Technique:\n\n1. **Choose a task** you've been putting off (homework assignment, studying for a test, organizing notes)\n2. **Break it down** into tiny first steps (opening your textbook, creating a document, gathering materials)\n3. **Set a timer** for just 5 minutes\n4. **Begin working** on only the first micro-step\n5. When the timer ends, decide whether to continue or stop\n\n### Example Micro-Steps:\n- For an essay: Open document and write just the title\n- For math homework: Set up your workspace and write the first problem\n- For studying: Open your notes and read just the first page\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\nAfter completing your 5-Minute Start, consider these questions:\n\n1. How did you feel before starting the task?\n2. How did you feel during the 5 minutes?\n3. Did you notice any change in your resistance to the task?\n4. Were you able to continue beyond the 5 minutes? Why or why not?\n5. How could you apply this technique to other tasks you've been avoiding?\n\n## Why This Works\n\nThe 5-Minute Start Technique works because it:\n- Bypasses the brain's resistance to large, overwhelming tasks\n- Creates momentum that often carries you beyond the initial 5 minutes\n- Provides a sense of accomplishment even if you only complete the minimum\n- Reduces anxiety by making commitment small and manageable\n- Builds confidence in your ability to tackle difficult tasks\n\nRemember: The hardest part of any task is often just getting started. By committing to just 5 minutes, you overcome the biggest hurdle to productivity.",
