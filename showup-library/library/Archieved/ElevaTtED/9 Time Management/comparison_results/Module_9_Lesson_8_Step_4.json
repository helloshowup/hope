Create a simple survey using Google Forms or Microsoft Forms to collect:\n   - Common time management challenges students face\n   - Questions about organizing coursework effectively\n   - Successful strategies students have implemented\n   - Resources students have found helpful\n\n2. Share the survey with your cohort and set a deadline for responses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze and Select Content\n1. Review all submissions and identify patterns in the questions.\n2. Select the top ten most frequently asked questions.\n3. For each question, craft a clear, concise answer (2-3 sentences) based on peer responses.\n4. Identify 1-2 resource links for each question that provide additional information.\n\n### Step 3: Design Your FAQ Document\n1.

Share the completed PDF with your instructor for review.\n2. Distribute the approved document to your entire cohort.\n3. Consider presenting the key findings in a brief class discussion.\n4. Collect feedback for potential updates to the document.\n\n## Assessment\nYour peer-sourced FAQ will be evaluated based on:\n- Comprehensiveness of questions and answers\n- Quality and relevance of resource links\n- Organization and visual design of the PDF\n- Usefulness to the cohort as reported in feedback\n\n## Extension Activity\nConsider creating a \"Time Management Success Stories\" companion document that highlights specific strategies that worked well for your peers, complete with concrete examples and implementation tips.",
