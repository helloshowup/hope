In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a personalized productivity dashboard that combines your calendar, task manager, and focus timer in one convenient location. This integrated approach will help you plan, prioritize, and stay focused on your daily tasks.\n\n## What You'll Need\n\n- A Notion account (free version works fine)\n- Access to your preferred calendar (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.)\n- A task management system (Todoist, Asana, or Notion's built-in tasks)\n- A focus timer app or website (Pomofocus, Forest, etc.)\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Create Your Dashboard in Notion\n\n1.

Click \"Create embed\"\n\n### Step 3: Add Your Task Manager\n\n1. Position your cursor where you want your tasks to appear\n2. Type `/embed` and press Enter\n3. Select \"Create an embed\"\n4. If using Todoist:\n   - Log into Todoist in another tab\n   - Go to Settings \u2192 Integrations\n   - Find the \"Embed Todoist\" section and copy the embed code\n   - Paste this code into Notion's embed field\n5. If using Notion's built-in tasks:\n   - Type `/to-do list` and press Enter\n   - Add your tasks directly\n\n### Step 4: Add a Focus Timer\n\n1. Position your cursor where you want your timer\n2. Type `/embed` and press Enter\n3. For Pomofocus:\n   - Enter `https://pomofocus.io/` in the URL field\n4. For Forest:\n   - Enter `https://www.forestapp.cc/` in the URL field\n5. Click \"Create embed\"\n\n### Step 5: Customize Your Layout\n\n1. Drag and resize your widgets by clicking and holding the corners\n2. Add headings and dividers using `/heading` and `/divider` commands\n3. Consider adding additional sections like:\n   - Daily priorities (top 3 tasks)\n   - Notes section\n   - Weekly goals\n\n### Step 6: Share Your Dashboard (View-Only)\n\n1. Click \"Share\" in the top-right corner\n2. Toggle \"Allow editing\" to OFF\n3. Click \"Copy link\"\n4. Share this link with others who need to see (but not edit) your schedule\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour productivity dashboard is now ready to use! This integrated approach combines planning, task management, and focused work time in one place. Customize it further based on your personal workflow and preferences. Remember that the most effective productivity system is one you'll actually use consistently.\n\n## Practice Activity\n\nSpend 15 minutes setting up your dashboard, then use it for one full day. Note what works well and what could be improved, then make adjustments accordingly.",
