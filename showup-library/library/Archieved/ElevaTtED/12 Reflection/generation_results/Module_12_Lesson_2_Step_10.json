In this lesson, you'll learn how to create a progress tracking system using Google Sheets. This tracker will help you monitor your improvement over time using visual indicators like conditional formatting and progress charts.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\n- Create a basic tracking spreadsheet in Google Sheets\n- Enter and organize sample data\n- Apply conditional formatting to visually represent progress\n- Insert and customize a progress bar chart\n- Share your tracker with appropriate permissions\n\n## Step-by-Step Tutorial\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Google Sheet\n1. Open your web browser and go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)\n2. Click the \"+ New\" button in the top-left corner\n3. Select \"Google Sheets\" from the dropdown menu\n4. Rename your sheet by clicking on \"Untitled spreadsheet\" at the top and typing \"My Progress Tracker\"\n\n### Step 2: Enter Sample Data\n1. In cell A1, type \"Date\"\n2. In cell B1, type \"Activity\"\n3. In cell C1, type \"Duration (min)\"\n4. In cell D1, type \"Intensity (1-10)\"\n5. In cell E1, type \"Progress Rating (1-3)\"\n6. Enter sample data in rows 2-5 with different dates, activities, durations, intensity levels, and progress ratings\n\n### Step 3: Apply Conditional Formatting\n1. Select column E (your Progress Rating column)\n2. Click on \"Format\" in the menu bar, then \"Conditional formatting\"\n3. In the sidebar that appears, set the following rules:\n   - Format cells if... \"Value is equal to\" 1 \u2192 Fill color: Red\n   - Click \"Add another rule\"\n   - Format cells if... \"Value is equal to\" 2 \u2192 Fill color: Yellow\n   - Click \"Add another rule\"\n   - Format cells if... \"Value is equal to\" 3 \u2192 Fill color: Green\n4. Click \"Done\"\n\n### Step 4: Insert Progress Bar Chart\n1. Select all your data including headers (A1:E5)\n2. Click \"Insert\" in the menu bar, then \"Chart\"\n3. In the Chart editor sidebar, select \"Column chart\" as the chart type\n4. Under \"Data range,\" ensure your selection is correct\n5. Set \"Progress Rating\" as your primary data series\n6. Customize the chart title to \"My Progress Over Time\"\n7. Click \"Customize\" tab to adjust colors and layout as needed\n8. Click \"Save\" when finished\n\n### Step 5: Share Your Tracker\n1. Click the blue \"Share\" button in the top-right corner\n2. In the sharing settings, click \"Get link\"\n3. Change the permission setting to \"Anyone with the link can view\"\n4. Copy the link to share with others\n5. Click \"Done\"\n\n## Your Turn!\nNow it's your turn to create your own progress tracker. Pause this tutorial and follow the steps we just covered to build your own version. Feel free to customize it for tracking your specific goals or activities.\n\nWhen you're finished, you'll have a visual tracking system that helps you monitor your progress using color-coded indicators and charts!\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Tracker Setup Workshop (Spiral 1)\n\n## Learning Objective\nIn this workshop, you will learn how to create a progress tracker using Google Sheets that will help you monitor your physical education goals over time.\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Computer or tablet with internet access\n- Google account\n\n## Introduction\nTracking your progress is essential for achieving your fitness goals. Today, we'll create a simple but powerful tracker in Google Sheets that uses color coding and visual elements to help you stay motivated.\n\n## Step-by-Step Tutorial\n\n### 1. Create a New Google Sheet\n- Open your web browser and go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)\n- Click on the \"+\" icon to create a new blank spreadsheet\n- Click on \"Untitled spreadsheet\" at the top and rename it to \"My Fitness Tracker\"\n\n### 2. Enter Sample Data\n- In cell A1, type \"Date\"\n- In cells B1 through F1, enter the activities you want to track (e.g., \"Push-ups\", \"Sit-ups\", \"Running (min)\", \"Stretching (min)\", \"Water (cups)\")\n- In column A, enter dates for the next two weeks (A2:A15)\n- Enter some sample data for each activity across the rows (e.g., 15 push-ups on day 1, 17 on day 2, etc.)\n\n### 3. Apply Conditional Formatting\n- Select the data range (B2:F15)\n- Click on \"Format\" in the menu, then \"Conditional formatting\"\n- Select \"Color scale\"\n- Choose the red-yellow-green color scale (red for lowest values, green for highest)\n- Click \"Done\"\n\n### 4. Insert Progress Bar Chart\n- Select the data for one activity (e.g., B1:B15 for push-ups)\n- Click \"Insert\" in the menu, then \"Chart\"\n- In the Chart editor, select \"Column chart\"\n- Customize the chart title to \"Push-ups Progress\"\n- Click \"Customize\" tab and adjust colors if desired\n- Click \"Save\"\n- Repeat for other activities if you wish\n\n### 5. Share Your Tracker\n- Click the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner\n- Click \"Get link\"\n- Set permissions to \"Anyone with the link can view\"\n- Copy the link to share with your teacher or coach\n\n## Your Turn\nNow it's your turn to practice! Pause this tutorial and follow the steps above to create your own fitness tracker. Customize it with activities that align with your personal fitness goals.\n\n## Reflection Questions\nOnce you've created your tracker:\n1. How might this visual representation help you stay motivated?\n2. What other data could you track to give you a more complete picture of your fitness journey?\n3. How often do you think you should update this tracker for it to be most effective?\n\n## Next Steps\nIn our next workshop, we'll explore how to analyze the data you collect and make adjustments to your fitness goals based on your progress.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Tracker Setup Workshop (Spiral 1)\n\n## Overview\nIn this workshop, you'll learn how to create a progress tracker using Google Sheets. This digital tool will help you monitor your performance over time with visual indicators and charts.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Create a functional Google Sheet tracker\n- Apply conditional formatting to visualize progress\n- Generate a progress bar chart\n- Share your tracker with appropriate permissions\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### 1. Creating a Google Sheet\n\nFirst, let's create a new Google Sheet:\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)\n2. Click on the \"+\" icon or select \"Blank\" to create a new spreadsheet\n3. Click on \"Untitled spreadsheet\" at the top and rename it \"My Progress Tracker\"\n\n### 2. Entering Sample Data\n\nNow, let's set up our tracker with sample data:\n1. In cell A1, type \"Date\"\n2. In cell B1, type \"Activity\"\n3. In cell C1, type \"Score (%)\"\n4. In cells A2-A6, enter five consecutive dates (e.g., 5/1/2023, 5/2/2023, etc.)\n5. In cells B2-B6, enter sample activities (e.g., \"Running,\" \"Swimming,\" \"Cycling,\" etc.)\n6. In cells C2-C6, enter sample scores between 0-100 (e.g., 65, 70, 85, 78, 90)\n\n### 3. Applying Conditional Formatting\n\nLet's create visual indicators using colors:\n1. Select cells C2-C6 (your score column)\n2. Click on \"Format\" in the menu, then \"Conditional formatting\"\n3. In the sidebar that appears, set the following rules:\n   - Format cells if \"Greater than or equal to\" 80 \u2192 Fill color: green\n   - Click \"Add another rule\"\n   - Format cells if \"Greater than or equal to\" 60 \u2192 Fill color: yellow\n   - Click \"Add another rule\"\n   - Format cells if \"Less than\" 60 \u2192 Fill color: red\n4. Click \"Done\"\n\n### 4. Inserting a Progress Bar Chart\n\nLet's visualize your progress with a chart:\n1. Select cells A1-C6 (including headers and all data)\n2. Click \"Insert\" in the menu, then \"Chart\"\n3. In the Chart editor sidebar, select \"Column chart\" from the drop-down menu\n4. Adjust settings if needed (the X-axis should show dates, and the Y-axis should show scores)\n5. Click \"Customize\" tab to change colors or titles if desired\n6. Click the three dots in the corner of the chart and select \"Move to own sheet\"\n\n### 5. Sharing Your Tracker\n\nFinally, let's share your tracker:\n1. Click the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner\n2. Click \"Get link\"\n3. Under \"General access,\" click the dropdown and select \"Anyone with the link\" and \"Viewer\"\n4. Copy the link to share with others who need to view (but not edit) your progress\n\n## Your Turn\n\nNow pause this tutorial and replicate what you've learned:\n1. Create your own Google Sheet tracker\n2. Enter your personal activity data\n3. Apply the conditional formatting\n4. Create your progress chart\n5. Practice sharing with appropriate permissions\n\nOnce complete, you'll have a powerful visual tool to track your progress over time!\n</educational_content>"
