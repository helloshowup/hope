They provide a clear, at-a-glance view of where you started, where you are now, and how close you are to reaching your targets. By using a dashboard, you can:\n\n- Visualize your progress over time\n- Identify trends or patterns in your performance\n- Stay motivated by seeing incremental improvements\n- Make data-driven decisions about adjusting your strategies\n\n## Understanding Dashboard Columns\n\nA basic progress dashboard typically includes these key columns:\n\n1. **Goal**: The specific objective you're working toward (e.g., \"Complete 30 minutes of daily physical activity\")\n2. **Metric**: How you'll measure progress (e.g., \"Minutes of physical activity per day\")\n3. **Baseline**: Your starting point (e.g., \"10 minutes per day\")\n4. **Current**: Your most recent measurement (e.g., \"25 minutes per day\")\n5. **Status**: Visual indicator of progress (e.g., \"On track\" or color coding like green/yellow/red)\n\n## Sample Dashboard\n\nBelow is a simple example of what a progress dashboard might look like:\n\n| Goal | Metric | Baseline | Current | Status |\n|------|--------|----------|---------|--------|\n| Improve cardiovascular fitness | Mile run time | 12:30 | 10:45 | On track |\n| Increase flexibility | Touch toes without bending knees | No | Partial | In progress |\n| Develop strength | Number of push-ups | 5 | 12 | Exceeded |\n| Maintain hydration | Water bottles consumed daily | 2 | 3 | Meeting goal |\n\n## Free Tools for Creating Dashboards\n\nYou don't need expensive software to create effective progress dashboards. Here are some free options:\n\n1. **Google Sheets**: Easy to use, accessible from any device, and includes templates and chart options.\n2. **Notion**: Combines dashboards with notes and task management in a flexible workspace.\n3. **Microsoft Excel Online**: Robust features available through free online version.\n4. **Trello**: Visual boards that can be adapted for progress tracking.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo help you begin tracking your progress, we've created a starter template you can download and customize for your own goals. The template includes:\n\n- Pre-formatted columns\n- Sample goals to inspire your own\n- Automatic color coding for status\n- Simple graphs to visualize progress over time\n\n[Download Progress Dashboard Starter Template](https://excelhs.org/resources/progress-dashboard-template)\n\nRemember to update your dashboard regularly - consistent tracking is key to seeing patterns in your progress and staying motivated toward your goals.",
