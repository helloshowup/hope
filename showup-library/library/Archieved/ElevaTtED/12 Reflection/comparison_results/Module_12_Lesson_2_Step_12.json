SMART goals provide a structured framework that helps you create clear, achievable objectives. In this activity, you'll learn how to create SMART goals that align with your dashboard metrics.\n\n## What are SMART Goals?\nSMART is an acronym that stands for:\n- **S**pecific: Clear and well-defined\n- **M**easurable: Quantifiable to track progress\n- **A**chievable: Realistic and attainable\n- **R**elevant: Aligned with your broader objectives\n- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline or timeframe\n\n## SMART Goals Worksheet\n\nUse the table below to develop your SMART goals. Review the example first, then create your own goals.\n\n| Goal | Specific | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time-bound |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|\n| **EXAMPLE:** Improve math grade | I will raise my math grade from a C to a B | I will track my progress through weekly quiz scores and monthly test results | I will dedicate 30 minutes daily to math practice and seek help when needed | This aligns with my dashboard academic performance metrics and my college aspirations | By the end of this semester (December 15) |\n| **Academic Goal 1:** | | | | | |\n| **Academic Goal 2:** | | | | | |\n| **Personal Goal:** | | | | | |\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Create Two Academic Goals:**\n   - Review your academic performance metrics on your dashboard\n   - Choose two areas where you'd like to improve\n   - Complete all columns of the SMART framework for each goal\n\n2. **Create One Personal Goal:**\n   - This could relate to extracurricular activities, health, social skills, or any non-academic area\n   - Ensure it connects to relevant metrics on your dashboard (e.g., attendance, participation)\n   - Complete all columns of the SMART framework\n\n3. **Link to Dashboard Metrics:**\n   - For each goal, identify which specific dashboard metrics you'll use to track your progress\n   - Note how improvements in these goals will be reflected in your dashboard data\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\nAfter completing your SMART goals table, answer these questions:\n\n1. How will tracking these goals on your dashboard help you stay accountable?\n2. What potential obstacles might you face in achieving these goals, and how will you overcome them?\n3. How might your SMART goals evolve as you progress through the school year?\n\nRemember, effective goals are living documents. Revisit and revise your SMART goals regularly as you track your progress on your dashboard.",
