I started by researching beginner running plans and committed to running three times weekly, gradually increasing my distance. I tracked my progress in a journal and adjusted my schedule when needed. When race day arrived, I finished in 32 minutes\u2014faster than my goal time! I felt an incredible sense of accomplishment crossing the finish line, especially since I couldn't run a full mile when I started. This experience taught me that consistent effort and a structured approach can help me achieve goals that initially seem intimidating. My next step is to train for a 10K in the spring while improving my running form and pace.\n> \n> (149 words)\n\n## Rubric\nYour reflection will be evaluated based on:\n\n| Criteria | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Honesty | Authentic sharing of a real achievement |\n| Growth Language | Focus on effort, process, and learning rather than just outcomes |\n| Clarity | Well-organized writing that follows the five-part structure |\n| Completeness | Includes all required elements (context, process, feelings, lesson, next step) |\n| Format | Meets word count limit and includes the #Accomplishment tag |\n\n## Tips for Success\n- Choose an achievement that genuinely matters to you\n- Be specific about the steps you took\n- Reflect on both the emotional impact and practical lessons\n- Connect your achievement to future goals\n- Edit carefully to stay within the word limit while including all required elements\n\n## Submission\nPost your reflection in the class forum under \"Weekly Prompt 1: Achievements\" by the deadline.
