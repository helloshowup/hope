Thoughtful peer feedback deepens both your learning and your classmates' understanding.\n\n### Choosing and Responding to a Peer Post\n\n1. Select one classmate's reflection post that resonates with you or presents interesting perspectives.\n2. Craft a response (150-200 words) that:\n   - Highlights a specific strength in their reflection\n   - Respectfully probes an assumption or area that could be expanded\n   - Suggests a practical next step or question for further reflection\n\n### Feedback Etiquette Reminders\n\n* Be respectful and constructive in all comments\n* Focus on the content, not the person\n* Ask questions rather than make judgments\n* Acknowledge both strengths and opportunities for growth\n* Use specific examples from their reflection\n\n### Sample Comment Template\n\n```\nHi [Peer's Name],\n\nI appreciated your reflection on [specific topic/experience they discussed]. Your insight about [specific strength] demonstrated thoughtful analysis because [explain why this stood out to you].\n\nI'm curious about your statement that [quote or paraphrase assumption]. Have you considered [alternative perspective or additional factor]? This might add another dimension to your reflection.\n\nAs you continue reflecting on this experience, you might find it valuable to explore [suggested next step or question]. This could help deepen your understanding of [relevant aspect of the reflection].\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\n[Your Name]\n```\n\nRemember that effective peer feedback is a skill that develops with practice. Your thoughtful responses help create a supportive learning community where everyone benefits from shared insights.",
