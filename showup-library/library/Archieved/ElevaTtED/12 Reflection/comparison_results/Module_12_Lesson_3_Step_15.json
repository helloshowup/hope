In this lesson, we'll analyze a real case study of a failed group project using the Gibbs Reflective Cycle and identify cognitive biases that may have influenced the outcome. This structured approach will help you develop critical thinking skills to evaluate your own experiences.\n\n## Case Study: The Deadline Disaster\n\n> **Group Project Timeline: School Fundraising Campaign**\n> \n> A team of five students was assigned to create a fundraising campaign for the school's athletic department. The project spanned four weeks and required research, planning, marketing materials, and a final presentation. Despite initial enthusiasm, the project failed to meet its deadline and received a poor grade.\n> \n> **Week 1:** Team met once, assigned roles, and created a basic outline. Two members missed the meeting.\n> \n> **Week 2:** Communication happened primarily through text messages. Research was delayed as team members waited for each other's contributions.\n> \n> **Week 3:** Team discovered their initial approach wouldn't work. Emergency meeting called, but only three members attended. Complete restart required.\n> \n> **Week 4:** Rushed completion with minimal coordination. Presentation contained contradictory information and incomplete sections. Final grade: D+\n\n## Walking Through the Gibbs Reflective Cycle\n\n### 1. Description: What happened?\n\n> *\"Our group project completely fell apart in the final week. We had to scramble to put together a presentation that made little sense, and we received our first D+ ever. It was embarrassing presenting such incomplete work.\"*\n\n### 2. Feelings: What were you thinking and feeling?\n\n> *\"I felt frustrated that others weren't contributing equally. I was anxious as the deadline approached, and eventually resigned to the fact we would fail. I also felt guilty for not speaking up sooner about the problems.\"*\n\n### 3. Evaluation: What was good and bad about the experience?\n\n> *\"The positive aspect was learning how NOT to manage a project. The negative was the poor grade and the tension it created between team members. We wasted time waiting for each other instead of being proactive.\"*\n\n### 4. Analysis: What sense can you make of the situation?\n\n> *\"We failed to establish clear communication channels and deadlines for individual contributions. We also avoided confronting problems until it was too late to fix them. No one took leadership when the original plan failed.\"*\n\n### 5. Conclusion: What else could you have done?\n\n> *\"We should have created a detailed timeline with checkpoints. We needed a communication plan beyond text messages and should have addressed participation issues immediately. Regular progress reviews would have identified problems earlier.\"*\n\n### 6. Action Plan: What would you do differently next time?\n\n> *\"In future group projects, I will suggest a project management approach with clear milestones. I'll advocate for weekly in-person meetings and a shared document to track progress. I'll also speak up earlier if I notice participation issues.\"*\n\n## Cognitive Biases Identified\n\n1. **Optimism Bias:** The team overestimated their ability to complete work quickly and underestimated the time needed.\n   > *\"We thought we could easily finish everything in the final week.\"*\n\n2. **Bystander Effect:** Team members waited for others to take initiative rather than stepping forward.\n   > *\"I assumed someone else would coordinate the research phase.\"*\n\n3. **Confirmation Bias:** The team ignored early warning signs that the project was in trouble.\n   > *\"We convinced ourselves that missing the first meeting wasn't a big deal.\"*\n\n4. **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing with an ineffective approach because time had already been invested.\n   > *\"We stuck with our original plan too long even when it clearly wasn't working.\"*\n\n## Activity: Setback Analysis Worksheet\n\n[Download the Annotation Worksheet](https://excelhs.org/resources/setback-analysis-worksheet.pdf)\n\nUse this worksheet to:\n- Identify a personal academic setback\n- Apply the Gibbs Reflective Cycle to your experience\n- Recognize potential cognitive biases in your thinking\n- Develop an action plan for future situations\n\nComplete the worksheet and share your insights during our next class discussion.",
