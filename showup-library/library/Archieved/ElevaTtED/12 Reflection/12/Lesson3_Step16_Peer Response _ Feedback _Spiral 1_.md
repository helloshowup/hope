# Peer Response & Feedback (Spiral 1)

## Instructions for Effective Peer Feedback

As we continue our reflective practice journey, it's time to engage with your peers' reflections. Thoughtful peer feedback deepens both your learning and your classmates' understanding.

### Choosing and Responding to a Peer Post

1. Select one classmate's reflection post that resonates with you or presents interesting perspectives.
2. Craft a response (150-200 words) that:
   - Highlights a specific strength in their reflection
   - Respectfully probes an assumption or area that could be expanded
   - Suggests a practical next step or question for further reflection

### Feedback Etiquette Reminders

* Be respectful and constructive in all comments
* Focus on the content, not the person
* Ask questions rather than make judgments
* Acknowledge both strengths and opportunities for growth
* Use specific examples from their reflection

Looking forward to your thoughts!
