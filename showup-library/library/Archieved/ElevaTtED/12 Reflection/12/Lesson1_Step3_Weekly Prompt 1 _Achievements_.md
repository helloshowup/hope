# Weekly Prompt 1 (Achievements)

# Weekly Prompt 1: Achievements

## Overview
This week, you'll reflect on a personal achievement that made you proud. Self-reflection helps us recognize our growth, understand our strengths, and identify areas for continued development.

## The Prompt
**"Describe a recent achievement you feel proud of."**

## Structure Guide
Your reflection should include these five components:

1. **Context (What)**: Clearly describe what you achieved and when it happened
2. **Process (How)**: Explain the steps you took to reach this achievement
3. **Feelings**: Share how this achievement made you feel
4. **Lesson Learned**: Reflect on what you learned about yourself
5. **Next Step**: Identify how you'll build on this achievement

## Requirements
- Keep your response to 150-200 words
- Tag your post with #Accomplishment
- Write honestly about your experience
- Use growth-oriented language (focus on effort, strategies, and progress)
- Ensure your writing is clear and well-organized

## Example
Here's a sample response that follows the structure:

> #Accomplishment
> 
> Last month, I completed my first 5K run after training for eight weeks. I started by researching beginner running plans and committed to running three times weekly, gradually increasing my distance. I tracked my progress in a journal and adjusted my schedule when needed. When race day arrived, I finished in 32 minutes—faster than my goal time! I felt an incredible sense of accomplishment crossing the finish line, especially since I couldn't run a full mile when I started. This experience taught me that consistent effort and a structured approach can help me achieve goals that initially seem intimidating. My next step is to train for a 10K in the spring while improving my running form and pace.
