# Tracker Setup Workshop (Spiral 1)

# Tracker Setup Workshop (Spiral 1)

## Overview
In this workshop, you'll learn how to create a digital progress tracker using Google Sheets. This tool will help you monitor your academic performance at Excel High School over time with visual indicators and charts, supporting your self-paced learning journey.

## Learning Objectives
- Create a functional Google Sheet tracker to monitor your course progress
- Apply conditional formatting to visualize your academic achievements
- Generate a progress bar chart to identify trends in your learning
- Share your tracker with appropriate permissions (parents, guardians, or Success Coaches)

## Tutorial

### 1. Creating a Google Sheet

First, let's create a new Google Sheet:
1. Open your web browser and navigate to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account (the same one you use for Excel High School)
3. Click on the "+" icon or select "Blank" to create a new spreadsheet
4. Click on "Untitled spreadsheet" at the top and rename it "My Excel HS Progress Tracker"

### 2. Entering Your Academic Data

Now, let's set up our tracker with your course information:
1. In cell A1, type "Date"
2. In cell B1, type "Course/Assignment"
3. In cell C1, type "Score (%)"
4. In cells A2-A6, enter five dates when you completed assignments
5. In cells B2-B6, enter your Excel High School courses or specific assignments (e.g., "Biology Unit 1 Quiz," "English Essay," "Algebra Test")
6. In cells C2-C6, enter your actual scores between 0-100

**Time Management Tip:** Set aside 15 minutes each week to update your tracker with new assignments and scores.

### 3. Applying Conditional Formatting

Let's create visual indicators using colors to quickly identify your performance levels:
1. Select cells C2-C6 (your score column)
2. Click on "Format" in the menu, then "Conditional formatting"
3. In the sidebar that appears, set the following rules:
   - Format cells if "Greater than or equal to" 80 → Fill color: green (Mastery level)
   - Click "Add another rule"
   - Format cells if "Greater than or equal to" 60 → Fill color: yellow (Approaching mastery)
   - Click "Add another rule"
   - Format cells if "Less than" 60 → Fill color: red (Needs improvement)
4. Click "Done"

### 4. Inserting a Progress Bar Chart

Let's visualize your academic progress with a chart:
1. Select cells A1-C6 (including headers and all data)
2. Click "Insert" in the menu, then "Chart"
3. In the Chart editor sidebar, select "Column chart" from the drop-down menu
4. Adjust settings if needed (the X-axis should show dates, and the Y-axis should show scores)
5. Click "Customize" tab to change colors or add a title like "My Excel HS Performance Trends"
6. Click the three dots in the corner of the chart and select "Move to own sheet"

**Study Skill Checkpoint:** What patterns do you notice in your performance? Are certain courses showing improvement over time?

### 5. Sharing Your Tracker

Finally, let's share your tracker with those supporting your educational journey:
1. Click the "Share" button in the top-right corner
2. Click "Get link"
3. Under "General access," click the dropdown and select "Anyone with the link" and "Viewer"
4. Copy the link to share with parents/guardians or your Excel High School Success Coach
5. Optional: For direct sharing, click "Share with people" and enter specific email addresses

## Your Turn

Now pause this tutorial and apply what you've learned:
1. Create your own Google Sheet tracker for your Excel High School courses
2. Enter your actual assignment data from at least two courses
3. Apply the conditional formatting to visualize your performance
4. Create your progress chart to identify trends
5. Share your tracker with a parent/guardian or your Success Coach for additional support

**Early Win Task:** After completing your tracker, take a screenshot of your progress chart and save it as evidence of your organizational skills development.

Once complete, you'll have a powerful visual tool to track your academic journey at Excel High School and take ownership of your learning progress!
