## Example Reflection Post:

```
[Tracker screenshot]

My positive trend has been consistent morning workouts, which has improved my energy levels throughout the day. I've successfully maintained my 6 AM routine for 12 days this month.

My challenge remains proper hydration. Despite setting reminders, I'm averaging only 4 cups of water daily instead of my 8-cup goal.

For improvement, I'll place water bottles in strategic locations (desk, car, bedside) and use my fitness app's hydration tracker with hourly alerts. I'll also connect drinking water to existing habits by having a full cup after each meal and workout.

What strategies have helped you overcome similar consistency challenges?
