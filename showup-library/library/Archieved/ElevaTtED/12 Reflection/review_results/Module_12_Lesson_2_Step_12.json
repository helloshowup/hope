SMART goals provide a structured framework that helps you create clear, achievable objectives. In this activity, you'll learn how to create SMART goals that align with your Excel High School dashboard metrics and support your educational journey.\n\n## What are SMART Goals?\nSMART is an acronym that stands for:\n- **S**pecific: Clear and well-defined\n- **M**easurable: Quantifiable to track progress\n- **A**chievable: Realistic and attainable\n- **R**elevant: Aligned with your broader objectives\n- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline or timeframe\n\n## Why SMART Goals Matter for Excel Students\n- They help you focus your efforts on what matters most\n- They provide clear milestones to celebrate your progress\n- They connect your daily actions to your long-term aspirations\n- They help you effectively use your Excel dashboard to monitor your growth\n\n## SMART Goals Worksheet\n\nUse the table below to develop your SMART goals. Review the example first, then create your own goals.\n\n| Goal | Specific | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time-bound |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|\n| **EXAMPLE:** Improve math grade | I will raise my math grade from a C to a B | I will track my progress through weekly quiz scores and monthly test results | I will dedicate 30 minutes daily to math practice and seek help from my Success Coach when needed | This aligns with my dashboard academic performance metrics and my college aspirations | By the end of this semester (December 15) |\n| **Academic Goal 1:** | | | | | |\n| **Academic Goal 2:** | | | | | |\n| **Personal Goal:** | | | | | |\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Create Two Academic Goals:**\n   - Review your academic performance metrics on your Excel dashboard\n   - Choose two areas where you'd like to improve (e.g., assignment completion rate, quiz scores, course progress)\n   - Complete all columns of the SMART framework for each goal\n\n2. **Create One Personal Goal:**\n   - This could relate to extracurricular activities, health, social skills, or any non-academic area\n   - Ensure it connects to relevant metrics on your dashboard (e.g., attendance, participation, time management)\n   - Complete all columns of the SMART framework\n\n3. **Link to Dashboard Metrics:**\n   - For each goal, identify which specific dashboard metrics you'll use to track your progress\n   - Note how improvements in these goals will be reflected in your dashboard data\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\nAfter completing your SMART goals table, answer these questions:\n\n1. How will tracking these goals on your Excel dashboard help you stay accountable?\n2. What potential obstacles might you face in achieving these goals, and how will you overcome them?\n3. How might your SMART goals evolve as you progress through the school year?\n4. What Excel High School resources (Success Coach, BRYTE AI Tutor, Writing Lab, etc.) could help you achieve your goals?\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Save your SMART goals** in an accessible place where you can review them regularly\n2. **Schedule weekly check-ins** with yourself to review your progress on the Excel dashboard\n3. **Share your goals** with your Success Coach or a trusted family member who can help keep you accountable\n4. **Celebrate small wins** as you make progress toward your goals\n\nRemember, effective goals are living documents. Revisit and revise your SMART goals regularly as you track your progress on your Excel dashboard.",
