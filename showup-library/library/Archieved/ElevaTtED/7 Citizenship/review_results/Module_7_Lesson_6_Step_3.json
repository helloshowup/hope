  "reviewed_content": "# We Do \u2014 Portfolio Setup Walk-through (Spiral 1)\n\n## Introduction\nWelcome to our guided portfolio setup session! Today, we'll walk through creating your digital citizenship portfolio using Google Sites. This portfolio will showcase your civic learning and community impact throughout the course. I'll guide you step-by-step through setting up the basic structure and organizing your artifacts with concept labels.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to:\n- Create a basic Google Sites portfolio with organized sections\n- Upload and tag artifacts with appropriate concept labels\n- Establish connections between different civic engagement experiences\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Computer with internet access\n- Your civic engagement artifacts (photos, reflections, project descriptions)\n- Notebook for taking notes\n\n## Step 1: Choosing a Website Builder (5-10 minutes)\n\nWe'll be using Google Sites for our portfolio, as it's free, user-friendly, and integrates well with other Google tools. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to sites.google.com\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"+\" to create a new site\n4. Name your site \"[Your Name]'s Citizenship Portfolio\"\n\n**Tip:** If you're having trouble accessing Google Sites, check the Help Center or message your instructor through the Excel High School Student Portal.\n\n## Step 2: Creating Main Sections (10-15 minutes)\n\nNow, let's create the essential sections for our citizenship portfolio:\n\n1. **Home Page**: Introduction to your civic identity\n   - Add a brief welcome statement\n   - Include a photo (optional)\n   - Summarize your civic interests\n\n2. **Community Engagement**: Projects and volunteer work\n   - Document community service\n   - Include project descriptions\n\n3. **Civic Knowledge**: Key concepts and learning\n   - Showcase your understanding of government and civic processes\n   - Connect to course materials\n\n4. **Reflection Space**: Personal growth and insights\n   - Record your learning journey\n   - Analyze challenges and successes\n\n5. **Future Goals**: Civic aspirations and plans\n   - Outline your civic ambitions\n   - Set measurable objectives\n\nFor each section, create a new page by clicking the \"Pages\" tab on the right sidebar, then the \"+\" button. Give each page a clear, descriptive title.\n\n## Step 3: Tagging Artifacts with Concept Labels (10-15 minutes)\n\nNow I'll demonstrate how to add and tag your civic engagement artifacts:\n\n1. Select the \"Community Engagement\" page\n2. Click the \"Insert\" button and choose \"Upload\" to add a photo of a recent project\n3. Add a text box below the image with a description\n4. Create concept labels by adding a subheading with keywords like:\n   - \"Democratic Participation\"\n   - \"Community Problem-Solving\"\n   - \"Civic Responsibility\"\n   - \"Social Justice\"\n\n**Example:** For a beach cleanup project, you might tag it with \"Environmental Stewardship\" and \"Community Problem-Solving\" to show how it connects to multiple civic concepts.\n\n## Step 4: Creating Connections Between Artifacts (5-10 minutes)\n\nLet's create meaningful connections between your experiences:\n\n1. Add a reflection section under each artifact using the prompt: \"This experience connects to my understanding of citizenship because...\"\n2. Link related artifacts across different pages using the Insert > Link feature\n3. Create a simple concept map on your home page showing how your experiences connect\n\n## Your Turn (15-20 minutes)\n\nNow it's your turn to begin setting up your portfolio:\n\n1. Create your site following Steps 1-2\n2. Set up the five main sections\n3. Add at least one artifact with appropriate concept labels\n4. Write a brief reflection connecting your artifact to civic concepts\n\n**Checkpoint:** Before moving on, make sure you've:\n- [ ] Created your Google Site\n- [ ] Set up all five main sections\n- [ ] Added at least one artifact with concept labels\n- [ ] Written a brief reflection\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n- If you're having trouble uploading images, try using a different file format (JPG or PNG)\n- For text formatting issues, try using the built-in heading styles instead of manual formatting\n- Remember to click \"Publish\" to save your changes\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour citizenship portfolio is more than just a collection of work\u2014it's a reflection of your growth as an engaged citizen. By thoughtfully organizing and tagging your artifacts, you create a powerful showcase of your civic learning and impact.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Continue adding artifacts as you complete course activities\n- Prepare to share your progress in our next class session\n- Explore the \"Themes\" option to personalize your portfolio's appearance\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [Google Sites Tutorial Video](https://support.google.com/sites/)\n- Digital Citizenship Portfolio Rubric (available in your course materials)\n- Sample Student Portfolios (in the Resources section)",
