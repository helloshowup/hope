This module will help you develop essential strategies to keep your digital life secure and protect your personal information.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this module, you will be able to:\n- Implement password management best practices\n- Set up two-factor authentication on your accounts\n- Identify common phishing attempts\n- Manage your digital footprint effectively\n- Respond appropriately to security breaches\n\n## Password Managers: Your Digital Keychain\n\nPassword managers are specialized applications that securely store all your passwords in an encrypted vault. Instead of memorizing dozens of complex passwords, you only need to remember one master password.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Creates strong, unique passwords for each site\n- Automatically fills login forms\n- Alerts you if a website has been compromised\n- Syncs across all your devices\n\nPopular options include LastPass, Dashlane, and Bitwarden. Most offer free versions with basic features.\n\n**Quick Activity:** Take 2 minutes to research one password manager. What feature would be most useful to you personally?\n\n## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): The Double Lock\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring two different verification methods:\n1. Something you know (password)\n2. Something you have (phone, security key)\n\nWhen you log in with 2FA enabled, after entering your password, you'll receive a temporary code via text message, email, or authentication app. This means that even if someone steals your password, they still can't access your account without the second factor.\n\n**Real-World Application:** Many colleges, employers, and financial institutions now require 2FA for account access. Setting this up now builds an important digital skill for your future.\n\n## Phishing Red Flags: Don't Take the Bait\n\nPhishing attempts try to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Watch for these warning signs:\n\n- Urgent requests for personal information\n- Suspicious sender addresses (look closely at the domain)\n- Generic greetings instead of your name\n- Poor grammar or spelling errors\n- Suspicious links (hover before clicking to see the actual URL)\n- Requests for payment or financial details\n\nWhen in doubt, contact the company directly through their official website or phone number\u2014not through the suspicious message.\n\n**Check Your Understanding:** Which of these emails would be most suspicious?\n- Your bank sending a statement to your registered email address\n- Netflix asking you to \"update your payment information immediately by clicking here\"\n- A message from your instructor about an upcoming assignment\n- A newsletter you subscribed to last month\n\n## Digital Footprints: Tracking Your Online Trail\n\nEvery online action leaves a trace called a digital footprint. This includes:\n\n- Social media posts and comments\n- Website visits and searches\n- Online purchases\n- App usage and permissions\n- Location data\n\nTo minimize your digital footprint:\n- Regularly review privacy settings on social media\n- Use private browsing modes\n- Limit app permissions\n- Consider using a VPN for sensitive activities\n- Regularly delete cookies and browsing history\n\n**Did You Know?** Many colleges and employers now review applicants' social media profiles. Your digital footprint can impact your future opportunities.\n\n## Case Study: Compromised Email Account\n\n**Scenario:** Alex receives an alert that someone logged into their email from an unknown device in another country. Several contacts have received spam messages from Alex's account.\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n1. Change the password immediately\n2. Enable two-factor authentication\n3. Check account recovery options (phone number, backup email)\n4. Review recent account activity for suspicious actions\n5. Scan computer for malware\n6. Alert contacts about the compromise\n\n**Long-term Prevention:**\n1. Use a password manager to create and store strong passwords\n2. Enable login notifications for unusual activity\n3. Regularly review connected applications and revoke unnecessary access\n4. Be cautious about public Wi-Fi networks\n5. Update security questions with answers only you would know\n\n**Reflection Question:** What is one step from the case study that you could implement today to improve your own online security?\n\n## Practical Application\n\nChoose ONE of the following activities to complete:\n1. Enable 2FA on your most important account (email, banking, or social media)\n2. Review and update privacy settings on your primary social media platform\n3. Check if your email has been involved in any data breaches using a service like HaveIBeenPwned.com\n\n## Conclusion\n\nInternet safety isn't just about avoiding threats\u2014it's about creating habits that protect your digital life. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, recognizing phishing attempts, and managing your digital footprint, you can significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime.\n\nRemember: Your online security is only as strong as your weakest protection measure. Take time today to strengthen at least one aspect of your digital security.\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [Common Sense Media: Digital Citizenship](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship)\n- [Federal Trade Commission: Identity Theft Protection](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft)\n- [BRYTE AI Tutor Support](Link to Excel High School's AI tutor)",
