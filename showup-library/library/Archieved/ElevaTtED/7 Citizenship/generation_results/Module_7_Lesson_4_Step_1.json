Instead of asking \"How can others serve me?\" servant leaders ask, \"How can I serve others?\" This approach is built on key traits:\n\n1. **Listening** - Truly hearing others' needs and concerns\n2. **Empathy** - Understanding others' perspectives and feelings\n3. **Awareness** - Recognizing community issues that need addressing\n4. **Commitment to growth** - Helping others develop and succeed\n5. **Building community** - Bringing people together for positive change\n\n**[Cut to examples of youth-led initiatives]**\n\nLet's look at real examples of young servant leaders making a difference:\n\n**Example 1:** After noticing food insecurity in their community, 16-year-old Jasmine organized a student-run food pantry at her school. Rather than taking charge of everything herself, she listened to what families actually needed and empowered other students to take leadership roles.\n\n**Example 2:** The \"Clean Water Advocates\" club at Riverdale High School noticed contamination in local streams. Instead of just complaining, they partnered with environmental scientists, organized community clean-ups, and educated younger students about water conservation\u2014serving both the environment and their community.\n\n**[Transition to civic impact connections]**\n\nServant leadership directly connects to civic engagement in powerful ways:\n\n- **Problem-solving:** Servant leaders identify community needs and develop practical solutions\n- **Collaboration:** They bring diverse stakeholders together around common goals\n- **Sustainability:** By empowering others, their impact continues even after they move on\n- **Ripple effect:** Small actions inspire others, creating waves of positive change\n\n**[Closing with call to action]**\n\nAs you consider your own leadership journey, ask yourself:\n- What needs do I see in my community?\n- How can I use my skills to serve others?\n- Who can I empower along the way?\n\nRemember, impactful leadership isn't about having the loudest voice or most authority\u2014it's about lifting others up and creating lasting positive change together.\n\n**[End with diverse students engaged in community service]**\n\n## Discussion Questions After Video\n\n1. What servant leadership trait resonates most with you, and why?\n2. Can you identify a youth-led initiative in our community that demonstrates servant leadership?\n3. How might you apply servant leadership principles to address an issue you care about?\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn our upcoming activities, you'll identify a community need and develop an action plan using servant leadership principles to address it. Start thinking about issues you're passionate about and how you might make a difference!\n</educational_content>",

Today we're exploring servant leadership\u2014a powerful approach that puts others first and creates meaningful change in our communities.\n\n**[What is Servant Leadership?]**\nServant leadership flips traditional leadership upside down. Instead of asking \"How can others serve me?\" servant leaders ask, \"How can I serve others?\" This approach focuses on:\n\n- **Empathy**: Understanding others' needs and perspectives\n- **Listening**: Truly hearing what people are saying\n- **Stewardship**: Taking responsibility for the well-being of others\n- **Commitment to growth**: Helping everyone develop and succeed\n- **Building community**: Creating connections that strengthen everyone\n\n**[Youth-Led Examples]**\nYoung people around the world are demonstrating servant leadership:\n\n1. **Malala Yousafzai** began advocating for girls' education at age 11, putting herself at risk to serve others' needs for educational access.\n\n2. **Greta Thunberg** started as a lone climate activist and built a global movement by amplifying others' voices and focusing on collective action.\n\n3. **Local youth councils** where students identify community needs and develop solutions\u2014like creating community gardens in food deserts or organizing mental health awareness campaigns.\n\n4. **Student-led tutoring programs** where peers help each other succeed academically, showing how service can happen right in your school.\n\n**[Civic Impact Connections]**\nWhen you practice servant leadership:\n\n- You identify real community needs rather than assuming what others need\n- You build coalitions across different groups by listening and finding common ground\n- You create sustainable change because people feel ownership in the process\n- You develop solutions that truly work because they're built on genuine understanding\n\n**[Call to Action]**\nAs you move forward in this unit, consider:\n- What needs do you see in your community?\n- How can you use your skills to serve others?\n- Who might join you in making a difference?\n\nRemember, the most powerful leadership doesn't come from having authority\u2014it comes from serving a purpose greater than yourself.\n\n**[Closing]**\nIn our next activities, you'll have the chance to put these principles into practice.

    "<educational_content>\n# I Do \u2014 Leading for Impact: Video Script\n\n## Introduction (0:00-0:30)\n\n**[Visual: Diverse group of teenagers working together on community projects]**\n\nWelcome to \"Leading for Impact,\" where we explore how you can make meaningful change in your community! Today, we're focusing on servant leadership\u2014a powerful approach where leaders prioritize the needs of others above their own.\n\nServant leadership isn't about being in charge; it's about empowering others and creating positive change. As Robert K. Greenleaf, who developed this concept, said: \"The servant-leader is servant first... It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve.\"\n\n## Servant Leadership Traits (0:30-1:15)\n\n**[Visual: Graphics highlighting each trait as it's mentioned]**\n\nWhat makes a servant leader? Let's explore key traits:\n\n1. **Listening** - Servant leaders listen deeply to understand others' perspectives and needs\n2. **Empathy** - They put themselves in others' shoes to better support them\n3. **Awareness** - They stay conscious of how their actions impact the community\n4. **Commitment to growth** - They help everyone around them develop and thrive\n5. **Building community** - They bring people together around shared goals\n\nConsider Malala Yousafzai, who demonstrates these traits by amplifying the voices of girls seeking education worldwide. She listens to their struggles, empathizes with their challenges, and builds a global community of advocates.\n\n## Youth-Led Examples (1:15-2:15)\n\n**[Visual: Images of youth leaders and their initiatives]**\n\nYoung people across the world are embodying servant leadership:\n\n**Greta Thunberg** started as a single student protesting climate inaction. Rather than positioning herself as the center of attention, she uses her platform to amplify scientific voices and encourage youth worldwide to take action in their communities.\n\n**Jack Andraka** developed a breakthrough pancreatic cancer test as a teenager. Instead of keeping his research private, he openly shares his methods and encourages other young scientists to solve problems.\n\n**Local example:** Students at Carson High School noticed food insecurity in their community and created a student-run food pantry. Instead of managing everything themselves, they built a system where different student groups take responsibility, creating sustainability beyond any single leader.\n\n## Civic Impact Connections (2:15-3:00)\n\n**[Visual: Community transformation scenes showing before/after impacts]**\n\nWhen you apply servant leadership to civic action, remarkable things happen:\n\n1. **Sustainability**: Projects last beyond any single leader\n2. **Deeper impact**: By listening to community needs, solutions address real problems\n3. **Ripple effects**: As you empower others, they develop leadership skills too\n4. **Trust building**: Communities develop greater trust in youth-led initiatives\n\nRemember: The most effective civic leaders don't just solve problems\u2014they build capacity in others to create ongoing positive change.\n\nAs you consider your own leadership journey, ask yourself: \"How can I serve my community while helping others develop their own leadership potential?\"\n\n**[Closing visual: Call to action screen with reflection questions]**\n\nWhat community need could you address through servant leadership? Who might you empower along the way?\n</educational_content>"
