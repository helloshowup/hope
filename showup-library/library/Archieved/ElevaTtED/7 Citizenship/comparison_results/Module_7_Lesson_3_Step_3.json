  "best_version": "# You Do \u2014 Scenario Role-Play: Netiquette\n\n## Introduction\nIn online learning environments, practicing proper netiquette (internet etiquette) is essential for productive and respectful communication. This activity will help you practice responding appropriately to challenging online situations.\n\n## Activity Instructions\nBelow are three forum posts representing different challenging online communication scenarios. For each scenario:\n1. Read the post carefully\n2. Draft a 100-word respectful response\n3. Identify which netiquette principle you applied in your response\n\n## Scenario 1: Heated Debate\n**Forum Post:** \"This assignment is COMPLETELY POINTLESS! Anyone who thinks this helps us learn is DELUSIONAL. I can't believe we're wasting our time on this garbage when we could be learning something useful. If you disagree with me, you're part of the problem!\"\n\n## Scenario 2: Misinformation\n**Forum Post:** \"I read online that you don't need to cite sources in academic writing anymore. My cousin's friend is in college and says nobody checks citations anyway. So I'm not going to bother with references for this project since it's all just busy work.\"\n\n## Scenario 3: Trolling\n**Forum Post:** \"lol why is everyone trying so hard in this class? none of this matters in real life. just copy answers from google like i do. teachers don't even read our work anyway \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\"\n\n## Submission Requirements\nFor each scenario, submit:\n1. Your 100-word respectful response\n2. A statement identifying which netiquette principle you applied (e.g., respectful tone, factual correction, maintaining professionalism)\n\nRemember to remain constructive and respectful in all your responses, even when addressing inappropriate communication.",
