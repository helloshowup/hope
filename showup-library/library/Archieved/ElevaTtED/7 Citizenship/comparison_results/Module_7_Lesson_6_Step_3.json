Today, we'll walk through creating your digital citizenship portfolio using a free website builder. This portfolio will showcase your civic learning and community impact throughout the course. I'll guide you step-by-step through setting up the basic structure and organizing your artifacts with concept labels.\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Computer with internet access\n- Your civic engagement artifacts (photos, reflections, project descriptions)\n- Notebook for taking notes\n\n## Step 1: Choosing a Website Builder\n\nWe'll be using Google Sites for our portfolio, as it's free, user-friendly, and integrates well with other Google tools. Follow along as I demonstrate:\n\n1. Go to sites.google.com\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"+\" to create a new site\n4. Name your site \"[Your Name]'s Citizenship Portfolio\"\n\n## Step 2: Creating Main Sections\n\nWatch as I create the essential sections for our citizenship portfolio:\n\n1. Home Page: Introduction to your civic identity\n2. Community Engagement: Projects and volunteer work\n3. Civic Knowledge: Key concepts and learning\n4. Reflection Space: Personal growth and insights\n5. Future Goals: Civic aspirations and plans\n\nFor each section, I'll create a new page by clicking the \"Pages\" tab on the right sidebar, then the \"+\" button. Notice how I'm giving each page a clear, descriptive title.\n\n## Step 3: Tagging Artifacts with Concept Labels\n\nNow I'll demonstrate how to add and tag your civic engagement artifacts:\n\n1. Select the \"Community Engagement\" page\n2. Click the \"Insert\" button and choose \"Upload\" to add a photo of a recent project\n3. Add a text box below the image with a description\n4. Create concept labels by adding a subheading with keywords like:\n   - \"Democratic Participation\"\n   - \"Community Problem-Solving\"\n   - \"Civic Responsibility\"\n   - \"Social Justice\"\n\nThese concept labels help organize your work and demonstrate your understanding of key citizenship principles.\n\n## Step 4: Creating Connections Between Artifacts\n\nWatch as I show you how to create meaningful connections:\n\n1. Add a reflection section under each artifact\n2. Link related artifacts across different pages\n3. Create a concept map on your home page showing how your experiences connect\n\n## Your Turn\n\nNow it's your turn to begin setting up your portfolio. Start by:\n1. Creating your site\n2. Setting up the five main sections\n3. Adding at least one artifact with appropriate concept labels\n\nRemember, this is just the beginning of your portfolio journey. We'll continue to build and refine it throughout the course.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour citizenship portfolio is more than just a collection of work\u2014it's a reflection of your growth as an engaged citizen. By thoughtfully organizing and tagging your artifacts, you create a powerful showcase of your civic learning and impact.\n\nNext class, we'll share our progress and explore more advanced features for enhancing your portfolio.",
