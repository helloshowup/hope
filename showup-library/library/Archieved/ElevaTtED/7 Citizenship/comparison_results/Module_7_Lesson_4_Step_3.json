(volunteering, voting, community service, etc.)\n- Who is your target audience among your peers?\n- What would motivate this specific audience?\n- What objections might they have, and how can you address them?\n\n### Step 3: Drafting Your Motivational Post\nCompose a 150-word motivational post that includes:\n1.
