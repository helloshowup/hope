# We Do — Mini-Campaign Planner

# We Do — Mini-Campaign Planner

## Introduction

In today's lesson, we'll explore how to plan and organize a civic action campaign using a Mini-Campaign Planner. This practical tool helps you structure your ideas and create an effective roadmap for community initiatives. We'll use an anti-litter campaign as our example to demonstrate how the planner works.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the five key elements of an effective civic campaign
- Apply the SMART framework to create meaningful campaign goals
- Develop a strategic plan for a community issue you care about

## The Mini-Campaign Planner

A campaign planner helps you organize your thoughts and create a strategic approach to addressing community issues. Our interactive PDF planner focuses on five key elements:

1. **Campaign Goal**: What you want to achieve
2. **Target Audience**: Who you need to reach
3. **Communication Channels**: How you'll reach them
4. **Timeline**: When activities will happen
5. **Success Metrics**: How you'll measure results

## Example: Anti-Litter Campaign

Let's walk through each section of the planner using an anti-litter campaign example:

### 1. Campaign Goal
**Example Goal**: Reduce litter in Community Park by 50% within three months.

Your goal should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Rather than saying "clean up the park," we've specified how much improvement we want to see and by when.

**Quick Check**: What makes this goal "SMART"? Identify each component.
- S: _____
- M: _____
- A: _____
- R: _____
- T: _____

### 2. Target Audience
**Example Audiences**:
- Park visitors (primary)
- Local students
- Nearby businesses
- Neighborhood residents

Identifying your audience helps you tailor your message effectively. For our anti-litter campaign, we're focusing primarily on park users but including other stakeholders who can help create change.

**Reflection Point**: Why might it be important to identify both primary and secondary audiences?

### 3. Communication Channels
**Example Channels**:
- Social media (Instagram, Facebook)
- School announcements
- Community bulletin boards
- Local newspaper
- Face-to-face outreach at the park

Choose channels based on where your audience is most likely to engage. Our campaign uses both online and offline methods to maximize reach.

**Pro Tip**: Different audiences may respond better to different channels. Consider creating a simple chart matching your audiences to their preferred communication methods.

### 4. Timeline
**Example Timeline**:
- Week 1-2: Research current litter patterns and recruit volunteers
- Week 3-4: Launch social media campaign and install new trash bins
- Week 5-8: Host weekend cleanup events
- Week 9-12: Conduct follow-up assessment and share results

Breaking your campaign into phases helps keep activities organized and ensures steady progress.

**Time Management Strategy**: Set calendar reminders for key milestones to stay on track with your timeline.

### 5. Success Metrics
**Example Metrics**:
- Number of volunteers engaged
- Pounds of litter collected
- Before/after photos of park areas
- Reduction in visible litter (measured weekly)
- Social media engagement statistics

Measuring success helps you evaluate your impact and make improvements for future initiatives.

**Critical Thinking Question**: Why is it important to have multiple ways to measure success?
