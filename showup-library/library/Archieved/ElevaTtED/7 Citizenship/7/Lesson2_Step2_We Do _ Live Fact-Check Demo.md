# We Do — Live Fact-Check Demo

# We Do — Live Fact-Check Demo

## Introduction

Welcome to our live fact-checking demonstration! In today's digital environment, being able to verify information quickly and accurately is an essential skill. This guided demonstration will walk you through the process of fact-checking using lateral reading techniques and evaluation tools to help you become a more critical consumer of information.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this demonstration, you will be able to:
- Apply lateral reading techniques to verify claims
- Evaluate information using multiple credible sources
- Use an evaluation grid to organize your fact-checking process
- Make evidence-based judgments about information accuracy

## Fact-Checking Process

### Step 1: Identify the Claim

Let's examine this claim together:
> "Studies show that listening to classical music while studying improves test scores by 40%."

This claim sounds plausible, but before accepting it as fact, we need to investigate its accuracy.

### Step 2: Lateral Reading Across Multiple Sources

Rather than diving deeper into the original source, we'll practice lateral reading—opening new tabs to check other reliable sources. Let's examine three different sources:

**Tab 1: Academic Research Database**
Here we find several studies on the "Mozart Effect," but the research shows mixed results. Most studies indicate only temporary spatial reasoning improvements, not general test score increases of 40%.

**Tab 2: Educational Psychology Journal**
This source reveals that while music may help some students concentrate, the 40% improvement claim is not supported by peer-reviewed research. Most studies show modest benefits (5-10%) for certain types of tasks.

**Tab 3: Fact-Checking Website**
This dedicated fact-checking site rates the claim as "mostly false," explaining the origin of this misconception from a misinterpreted 1993 study.

### Step 3: Evaluation Grid

Let's document our findings in our evaluation grid:

| Evaluation Criteria | Assessment |
|---------------------|------------|
| Source Credibility | Original claim lacks citation to credible research |
| Evidence Quality | Multiple academic sources contradict the 40% figure |
| Expert Consensus | Experts agree music may help concentration but not by 40% |
| Context | Claim misrepresents a limited study on spatial reasoning |
| Current Research | Recent studies show much smaller effects |

### Step 4: Final Verdict

Based on our lateral reading and evaluation, we determine this claim is **MOSTLY FALSE**. While there is evidence that music can create a positive study environment for some students, the specific claim of a 40% improvement in test scores is not supported by scientific research.

## Your Turn: Practice Activity

Now it's your turn to apply these skills! Choose one of the following claims to fact-check:

1. "Drinking eight glasses of water daily is essential for health"
2. "Reading in dim light damages your eyesight"
3. "Humans only use 10% of their brains"

**Quick Practice Steps:**
1. Open at least two reliable sources in new tabs
2. Fill out a simple evaluation grid (template provided in the resources section)
3. Determine if the claim is: True, Mostly True, Mostly False, or False
4. Submit your findings in the discussion forum

## Conclusion

This demonstration shows how quick but thorough lateral reading across multiple sources helps us evaluate claims accurately. Remember to:
1. Identify specific claims
2. Check multiple reliable sources
3. Systematically evaluate the evidence
4. Reach a conclusion based on the best available information

This process takes practice but becomes faster and more intuitive with time. By applying these critical thinking skills, you'll be better equipped to navigate the information landscape and make informed decisions.
