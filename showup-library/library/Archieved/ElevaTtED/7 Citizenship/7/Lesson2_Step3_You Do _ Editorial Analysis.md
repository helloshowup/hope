# You Do — Editorial Analysis Quiz

## Interactive Fallacy and Evidence Quality Assessment

Test your critical thinking skills with this 10-question quiz. For each example, identify the logical fallacy present and rate the quality of evidence.

### Learning Objectives
* Identify common logical fallacies in media and political statements
* Evaluate the quality of evidence in argumentative claims
* Apply critical thinking skills to real-world examples

### Instructions
For each statement below:
1. Select the logical fallacy present (or "No fallacy" if appropriate)
2. Rate the evidence quality (Very poor, Poor, Weak, Moderate, Strong)
3. Submit your answers to receive immediate feedback

### Question 1
**Statement:** "Senator Johnson must be corrupt because all politicians are corrupt."
- **Identify the fallacy:** Hasty generalization
- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor
> **Feedback:** Correct! This is a hasty generalization that assumes all members of a group share the same characteristic without sufficient evidence.

### Question 2
**Statement:** "If we allow same-day voter registration, next thing you know, people will be voting multiple times and elections will be meaningless."
- **Identify the fallacy:** Slippery slope
- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor
> **Feedback:** Excellent! This is a slippery slope fallacy that assumes one action will inevitably lead to extreme consequences without evidence.

### Question 3
**Statement:** "According to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Political Science, districts with mail-in voting showed no statistically significant increase in fraud cases over a 20-year period."
- **Identify the fallacy:** No fallacy present
- **Rate evidence quality:** Strong
> **Feedback:** Correct! This statement cites specific research from a credible source with a substantial time frame.

### Question 4
**Statement:** "My opponent wants to increase education funding, but can we trust someone who got a C in economics during college?"
- **Identify the fallacy:** Ad hominem
- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor
> **Feedback:** Right! This attacks the person rather than addressing their argument.

### Question 5
**Statement:** "The mayor claims the new highway will reduce traffic, but she's just saying that because construction companies donated to her campaign."
- **Identify the fallacy:** Genetic fallacy
- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor
> **Feedback:** Correct! This dismisses an argument based on its origin rather than its merits.

### Question 6
**Statement:** "Either we cut taxes dramatically or the economy will collapse."
- **Identify the fallacy:** False dilemma
- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor
> **Feedback:** Excellent! This presents only two extreme options when many alternatives exist.

### Question 7
**Statement:** "A recent survey of 50 people at the mall showed that 80% oppose the new zoning law."
- **Identify the fallacy:** No clear fallacy, but sampling bias
- **Rate evidence quality:** Weak
> **Feedback:** Correct! While not technically a fallacy, this uses a small, non-representative sample to draw broad conclusions.

### Question 8
**Statement:** "The city council's proposal must be good because it was approved unanimously."
- **Identify the fallacy:** Appeal to popularity
- **Rate evidence quality:** Poor
> **Feedback:** Right! This assumes something is correct simply because many people support it.

### Question 9
**Statement:** "Climate legislation is unnecessary because it was cold last winter."
- **Identify the fallacy:** Anecdotal evidence
- **Rate evidence quality:** Very poor
> **Feedback:** Correct! This uses a single personal observation to contradict systematic scientific evidence.

### Question 10
**Statement:** "According to three independent economic analyses, the infrastructure bill would create approximately 2 million jobs over five years, though estimates vary by ±15%."
- **Identify the fallacy:** No fallacy present
- **Rate evidence quality:** Strong
> **Feedback:** Excellent! This presents specific data from multiple sources while acknowledging limitations.
