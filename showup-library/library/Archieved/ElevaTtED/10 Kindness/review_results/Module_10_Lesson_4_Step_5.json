How did practicing active listening impact your ability to connect with others?\n   * It helped me identify emotions that weren't explicitly stated\n   * It reduced misunderstandings in my conversations\n   * It made others more willing to share their thoughts with me\n   * It allowed me to provide more meaningful support\n   * It helped me be more patient in difficult conversations\n\n3. What challenge did you overcome when applying empathy in a difficult situation?\n   * Setting aside my own perspective temporarily\n   * Responding without judgment\n   * Managing my emotional reactions\n   * Finding common ground with someone very different from me\n   * Maintaining boundaries while being supportive\n\n## Time Management Tip\nThis activity should take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.
