  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the educational effectiveness of this activity:\n\n1. Added \"Success Tips\" section to provide clearer guidance on poster expectations and quality criteria\n2. Expanded the quiz by adding a fourth question about real-world application to reinforce transfer of learning\n3. Added an optional reflection component to encourage deeper personal connection with the material\n4. Improved formatting and organization for better visual clarity\n5. Modified question 3 to specifically reference \"in your poster\" to connect assessment directly to the created artifact\n6. Added more specific instructions about the number of examples needed in the poster (3-4)\n\nThese changes better align with the Excel High School learner profile by providing clearer structure for self-pacing students, supporting \"second-chance\" learners with scaffolding, and incorporating real-world application that adult learners will find relevant."
