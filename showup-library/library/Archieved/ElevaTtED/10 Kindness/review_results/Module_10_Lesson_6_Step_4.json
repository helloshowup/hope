Look for \"poster\" templates and customize with your kind words.\n\n### Export Tips:\n- Save as PDF for easy printing and sharing\n- For digital display, save as JPG or PNG\n- If printing, use standard paper sizes (8.5\u00d711\" or A4)\n- Consider laminating printed posters for durability\n\n## Reflection Questions\nAfter completing your poster, respond to these questions in 2-3 sentences each:\n\n1. How might these kind words impact someone's day? Think about a specific person who might see your poster.\n\n2. When could you use these phrases in your daily interactions? Identify at least two specific situations.\n\n3. Where would displaying this poster have the most positive effect? Why?\n\n4. Which phrase on your poster resonates with you the most personally? Explain why.\n\n## Extension Activity (Optional)\nCreate a digital version of your poster that can be shared on social media or via email. Consider how you might adapt your design for different digital formats (Instagram, email signature, phone wallpaper).\n\n## Submission Guidelines\nSubmit your completed poster as a PDF or image file. Include your written responses to the reflection questions in a separate document.\n\nRemember, the words we choose matter. Your kind words poster is not just an art project\u2014it's a reminder of how we can communicate with compassion and respect every day.",

Added clear learning objectives at the beginning to help students understand the purpose and expected outcomes of the activity.\n\n2. Enhanced the structure with more explicit instructions and guidance, particularly beneficial for self-paced learners who need clear direction.\n\n3. Added a \"Pro Tip\" section to support students who might be less familiar with digital design tools.\n\n4. Expanded the reflection section with specific, structured questions that promote deeper thinking about the impact of kind communication.\n\n5. Added an optional extension activity to provide differentiation for more advanced students or those who want to explore further.\n\n6.
