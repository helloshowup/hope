  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and educational effectiveness:\n\n1. Changed the title from \"Portfolio Progress Snapshot\" to \"Portfolio Progress Checkpoint\" to better reflect its purpose as a formal assessment point.\n\n2. Simplified the section heading from \"Check Your Progress\" to \"Track Your Progress\" for clarity.\n\n3. Added an optional question about challenges to provide students an opportunity to express difficulties they may be facing, which supports the \"Second-Chance Learners\" who need empathetic approaches.\n\n4. Expanded the \"Next Steps\" section with specific, actionable guidance that supports self-directed learning, which aligns with the \"Self-Direction Aids\" instructional design driver.\n\n5. Added an encouraging reminder at the end to motivate students and reinforce the purpose of the assignment, supporting the \"Scaffold & Spiral\" approach.\n\n6. Improved the formatting and structure to enhance readability and navigation, supporting the \"Flexibility WITH Structure\" design principle.\n\nThe revised content maintains the original purpose while providing clearer guidance, more support, and better alignment with Excel High School's instructional design principles."
