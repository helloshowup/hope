This plan will help you develop these qualities intentionally over time. Follow the steps below to complete each section of your growth plan template.\n\n### Step 1: Define Your Goal\nIdentify one specific kindness or empathy-related goal you want to work on. Your goal should be:\n- Clear and specific\n- Realistic to achieve\n- Meaningful to you personally\n\n**Example:** \"I want to become more aware of others' feelings and respond with appropriate empathy in my daily interactions.\"\n\n**Your Turn:** In the template, write your personal kindness or empathy goal in 1-2 sentences.\n\n### Step 2: List Your Action Steps\nOutline 3-5 concrete actions you will take to achieve your goal. These should be:\n- Specific behaviors or practices\n- Actions you can implement regularly\n- Measurable in some way\n\n**Examples:**\n- Practice active listening without interrupting during conversations\n- Ask at least one thoughtful follow-up question when someone shares something important\n- Notice and acknowledge others' emotions verbally (\"It sounds like you're feeling...\")\n\n**Your Turn:** Add your 3-5 action steps to the template. Be as specific as possible about what you'll do and how often.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Your Supports\nList resources, people, or tools that will help you succeed:\n- Who can support you in your growth?\n- What resources might you need?\n- What reminders or systems will help you stay consistent?\n\n**Examples:**\n- Weekly check-ins with a trusted friend\n- Journal to track progress and reflections\n- Reminder app for daily practice\n\n**Your Turn:** List at least 2-3 specific supports in your template that will help you stay accountable.\n\n### Step 4: Establish Your Metrics\nDetermine how you'll measure success:\n- How will you know you're making progress?\n- What specific evidence will show growth?\n- How often will you evaluate your progress?\n\n**Examples:**\n- Track instances when you successfully recognized and responded to others' emotions\n- Note feedback from others about your empathetic responses\n- Rate your own empathy efforts on a 1-10 scale weekly\n\n**Your Turn:** In your template, describe at least 2 specific ways you'll measure your progress.\n\n### Step 5: Set a Timeline for Review\nDecide when you'll check in on your progress:\n- Set a specific date (2-4 weeks from now) for your first review\n- Plan how you'll reflect on what's working and what needs adjustment\n- Consider scheduling regular check-ins (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)\n\n**Your Turn:** Add your review timeline to your template.\n\n### Step 6: Save to Your Portfolio\nOnce you've completed all sections of your growth plan template:\n1. Review your plan for completeness\n2. Make any necessary revisions\n3. Save the document to your digital portfolio\n4. Be prepared to revisit and update this plan as you grow\n\n**Remember:** This growth plan is a living document. As you develop your kindness and empathy skills, you may discover new insights that lead to adjustments in your approach. The most important aspect is your commitment to ongoing self-directed development.\n\n**Need Help?** If you're having trouble completing any section of your growth plan, reach out to your Success Coach through the messaging system or schedule a time to meet with them.",
  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and instructional effectiveness:\n\n1. Added explicit \"Your Turn\" prompts after each section to clearly direct students on what actions to take, supporting self-paced learners who need clear structure.\n\n2. Added a new \"Step 5: Set a Timeline for Review\" to build in accountability and reflection, which supports the mastery-led feedback approach in the learning design drivers.\n\n3. Added specific instructions about what to write in each section of the template (e.g., \"write your personal kindness or empathy goal in 1-2 sentences\").\n\n4. Added a \"Need Help?\" section at the end to connect students with support resources, which is especially important for self-directed and \"second-chance\" learners.\n\n5. Reorganized the content to create a more consistent pattern in each section: explanation, examples, and then explicit student directions.\n\nThese changes better align with the target learner profile by providing clearer structure for self-pacing, supporting confidence-building, and incorporating self-direction aids while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse learner segments."
