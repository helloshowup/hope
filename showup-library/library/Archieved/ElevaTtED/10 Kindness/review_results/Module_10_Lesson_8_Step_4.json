  "edit_summary": "I made several enhancements to improve the content for Excel High School students:\n\n1. Added specific references to Excel High School systems (student portal, discussion forum) to provide clearer context for submission locations.\n\n2. Added a deadline time for the final submission to eliminate ambiguity.\n\n3. Created a dedicated \"Reflection Guidance\" section with specific prompts to scaffold the reflection process, which supports both younger students and adult learners who may need structure.\n\n4. Added a \"Support Resources\" section that references Excel-specific support systems (Success Coach, BRYTE AI Tutor, Writing Lab) to connect students with available help.\n\n5. Enhanced instructions for peer review by specifying the discussion forum as the location.\n\n6. Added clarification about trying different types of acts in Week 3 to encourage variety.\n\n7. Added guidance to use \"guided reflection prompts\" in Week 2 to create a connection to the new Reflection Guidance section.\n\nThese changes align with the school's instructional design drivers by providing more structure while maintaining flexibility, incorporating self-direction aids, and referencing the support community available to students."
