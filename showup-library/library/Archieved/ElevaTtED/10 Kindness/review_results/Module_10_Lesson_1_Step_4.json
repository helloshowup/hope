  "reviewed_content": "# Create a \"Kindness Snapshot\" Collage\n\n## Overview\nIn this activity, you will create a visual representation of kindness in your community. By collecting images and words that illustrate acts of kindness you've observed or experienced, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how kindness and empathy appear in everyday life.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n- Identify examples of kindness in your daily environment\n- Analyze the relationship between kindness and empathy\n- Create a visual representation that communicates your understanding\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Kindness Snapshot Template (available in the Resources section below)\n- Digital images or words representing kindness\n- Computer or tablet with basic editing capabilities\n- Alternative option: Paper, magazines, and glue for those who prefer a physical collage\n\n## Time Required\n- Approximately 45-60 minutes to complete\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Access the Template\nDownload the Kindness Snapshot Template from the Resources section below. This template provides a drag-and-drop grid where you can easily arrange your images and text.\n\n**Alternative Option:** If you prefer to create a physical collage or have limited digital access, you may print the template and create your collage using paper, magazines, and glue.\n\n### Step 2: Collect Your Kindness Examples\nGather 5 different examples that represent kindness in your local context:\n- Take photos of kind acts you witness\n- Find images that represent kindness to you\n- Create text boxes with powerful words or quotes about kindness\n- Include symbols that represent kindness in your culture or community\n\n**Important:** Focus on examples from your own experience or community. These should be authentic representations of kindness that are meaningful to you.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Consider different types of kindness - small everyday acts, organized community efforts, or moments of unexpected compassion.\n\n### Step 3: Create Your Collage\n1. Open the template on your device\n2. Drag and drop your images into the grid\n3. Resize and position elements as needed\n4. Add a brief caption (1-2 sentences) beneath each image explaining:\n   - What this example shows about kindness\n   - Why you chose to include it\n\n### Step 4: Add Your Reflection\nAt the bottom of your collage, answer this reflection question in 3-5 sentences:\n\"How do these examples show the connection between kindness and empathy in everyday life?\"\n\n### Step 5: Export and Submit\n1. Save your completed collage as a JPG or PNG file\n2. Make sure your name is included on the collage\n3. Check that all 5 examples have captions\n4. Verify your reflection question is answered\n5. Upload your file to the submission area\n\n## Checklist for Completion\n- [ ] Downloaded and used the provided template (or created physical alternative)\n- [ ] Included 5 different examples of kindness\n- [ ] Added a brief caption for each example\n- [ ] Completed the reflection question (3-5 sentences)\n- [ ] Exported as JPG or PNG and uploaded\n\n## Resources\n- [Kindness Snapshot Template](#) (click to download)\n- [Tutorial: How to Use the Template](#) (2-minute video)\n- [Examples of Completed Projects](#) (for inspiration)\n\n## Need Help?\n- Contact your Success Coach through the Student Portal\n- Visit the Excel High School Writing Lab for assistance with your reflections\n- Use BRYTE AI Tutor for immediate guidance\n\nRemember, this activity helps us understand how kindness and empathy appear in our daily lives and communities.
