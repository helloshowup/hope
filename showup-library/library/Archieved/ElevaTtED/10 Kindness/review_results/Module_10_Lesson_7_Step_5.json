  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance clarity, engagement, and inclusivity:\n\n1. Softened the tone by changing \"you must\" to \"please\" and adding supportive language throughout to create a more encouraging learning environment.\n\n2. Added more context to each rubric criterion to help students better understand what's expected.\n\n3. Added a \"Self-Assessment Reflection\" section to promote deeper metacognitive thinking.\n\n4. Included a support reminder that references Excel High School's resources (Success Coach and BRYTE AI Tutor) to help struggling students.\n\n5. Improved the explanation of the purpose behind the self-assessment to help students understand its value rather than seeing it as just a requirement.\n\nThe revised content maintains the original structure and requirements while making the assessment process more supportive, clear, and aligned with Excel High School's instructional design principles of scaffolding and self-direction."
