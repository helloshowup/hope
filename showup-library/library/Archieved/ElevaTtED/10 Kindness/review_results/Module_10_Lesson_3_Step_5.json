  "edit_summary": "I made several improvements to enhance the educational effectiveness of this peer endorsement activity:\n\n1. Added clear learning objectives to help students understand the purpose and educational value of the activity\n2. Expanded the instructions with more specific guidance on what to include in their documentation and reflection\n3. Added a \"Tips for Success\" section to support students who might need additional scaffolding\n4. Clarified the peer review process and added information about what to do if students encounter difficulties\n5. Connected the activity more explicitly to educational concepts (empathy, community-mindedness) to emphasize its academic relevance\n6. Improved the overall structure with better formatting and more detailed subsections\n7. Added language that supports reflection and deeper learning rather than just task completion\n\nThese changes align with the Excel High School learner profile by providing clear structure for self-pacing students, supporting \"second-chance\" learners with scaffolding, and incorporating real-world choice and community engagement as highlighted in the instructional design drivers."
