By regularly reflecting on your experiences, you'll develop greater self-awareness and identify patterns in your interactions with others. This report will become an important piece of evidence in your kindness portfolio.\n\n## Report Template\n\nYour Mid-Month Reflection Report should include the following four sections:\n\n### 1. Introduction (50-75 words)\nBegin with a brief overview of your kindness focus for the past two weeks. What specific aspects of kindness or empathy were you working on? What were your goals? This section provides context for the rest of your reflection.\n\n### 2. Highlights (100-125 words)\nDocument 2-3 specific instances where you demonstrated kindness or empathy. For each example:\n- Describe the situation\n- Explain how you responded with kindness\n- Note how others reacted\n- Share how the experience made you feel\n\n### 3. Challenges (100-125 words)\nHonestly reflect on 1-2 situations where you struggled to show kindness or empathy:\n- What was the circumstance?\n- What made it difficult to respond with kindness?\n- How did you ultimately handle the situation?\n- What would you do differently next time?\n\n### 4. Action Plan (75-100 words)\nBased on your reflection, create a specific plan for the next two weeks:\n- What aspects of kindness will you focus on improving?\n- What specific actions will you take?\n- How will you measure your progress?\n\n## Word Count Tracker\n\nAs you write your report, keep track of your word count for each section:\n- Introduction: ___ words (target: 50-75)\n- Highlights: ___ words (target: 100-125)\n- Challenges: ___ words (target: 100-125)\n- Action Plan: ___ words (target: 75-100)\n- Total: ___ words (target: 325-425)\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n1.
