The diagram begins with one person performing a kind act in the center, then expands outward through numbered circles representing: 1) Immediate impact on recipient, 2) Emotional response and potential to inspire, 3) Community-level effects, and 4) Broader societal influence. Each numbered call-out corresponds to reflection questions in your worksheet.]\n\n**Caption:** This impact map illustrates how a single act of kindness creates a ripple effect. Starting from the center with one person's kind action, the influence expands outward through increasingly wider circles. Each numbered section corresponds to a question on your worksheet:\n\n1. The immediate impact on the person receiving kindness\n2. How that person's emotional state might change and inspire further kindness\n3. The potential community-level effects when kindness spreads\n4. The broader societal impact when kindness becomes normalized\n\nAs you complete your worksheet, consider how your own kind actions might create similar expanding circles of positive influence in your world.",
