Today, we'll explore how to understand and support our peers by practicing empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. By developing this skill, you can become a better friend and classmate.\n\n## Narrator's Empathy Demonstration\n\n*[Narrator begins with a scenario]*\n\n\"Let's imagine that your friend Jamie hasn't been participating in group activities lately. During lunch, Jamie sits alone and seems distracted. Let me walk you through how I might approach this situation with empathy.\"\n\n*[Narrator pauses and begins thinking aloud]*\n\n\"I notice Jamie sitting alone again today. Instead of just assuming Jamie is being antisocial, I should consider what might be happening in Jamie's life. Everyone has different experiences that affect their behavior.\"\n\n*[INTERACTIVE HOTSPOT 1: \"What observations can help you understand Jamie better?\"]*\n\n\"I remember Jamie mentioned a grandparent being sick last week. Also, Jamie's grades have been slipping recently, which is unusual. These changes in behavior might indicate something difficult is happening.\"\n\n*[Narrator continues]*\n\n\"If I put myself in Jamie's position, I might feel overwhelmed, worried, or even embarrassed about struggling. It would be hard to focus on socializing if I had bigger concerns on my mind.\"\n\n*[INTERACTIVE HOTSPOT 2: \"How might Jamie be feeling right now?\"]*\n\n\"Rather than judging Jamie for being quiet, I can recognize that everyone handles stress differently. Some people need space when they're upset, while others need support.\"\n\n*[Narrator continues]*\n\n\"I want to help Jamie, but I need to consider the best approach. Calling attention to Jamie in front of everyone might cause embarrassment. A private conversation might be better.\"\n\n*[INTERACTIVE HOTSPOT 3: \"What would be a supportive way to approach Jamie?\"]*\n\n\"I could simply sit with Jamie at lunch and start with casual conversation. Then I might say something like, 'I've noticed you seem a bit quiet lately. I'm here if you want to talk about anything.'\"\n\n*[Narrator concludes]*\n\n\"By taking time to understand Jamie's perspective before acting, I'm practicing empathy. I don't need to solve Jamie's problems\u2014sometimes just showing someone you care is enough support.\"\n\n## Practice Activity\n\nNow it's your turn to practice empathy. Click on each hotspot to reveal questions that can guide your empathic reasoning when a peer is facing a challenge:\n\n1. What might be happening in their life that I don't know about?\n2. How would I feel if I were in their situation?\n3. What kind of support would I want if I were them?\n4. How can I show I care without making assumptions?\n\nRemember, empathy takes practice. The more you try to understand others' perspectives, the more naturally empathic you'll become.",
