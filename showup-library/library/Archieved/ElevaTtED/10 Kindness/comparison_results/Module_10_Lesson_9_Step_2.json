Your participation will help us identify meaningful projects we can implement together.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Share Your Ideas:** Post a reply listing THREE initiative ideas that could promote kindness in our community. For each idea:\n   - Provide a brief description (2-3 sentences)\n   - Tag each idea with a THEME (e.g., #environment, #seniors, #education, #mentalhealth)\n   - Indicate the SCALE of each idea (#individual, #smallgroup, #wholeclass, #schoolwide, #community)\n\n2. **Engage With Others:** Review your peers' ideas and interact with at least 3 posts by:\n   - Liking ideas that resonate with you\n   - Replying with constructive feedback or building upon their ideas\n   - Asking thoughtful questions to help develop promising concepts\n\n3. **Collaborative Development:** Our facilitator will summarize the most popular themes and ideas after everyone has participated, creating a shortlist of potential initiatives for further development.\n\nRemember, effective initiatives can range from simple individual actions to complex community-wide projects. Be creative, practical, and considerate of available resources.\n\nLet's brainstorm together and discover how we can make a meaningful difference through kindness!\n\n*Post your ideas by [DATE].
