This interactive tool will help you intentionally incorporate acts of kindness into your daily routine. Research shows that planning kindness activities increases follow-through by 60%, helping you create positive habits that benefit both yourself and others.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n- Create a personalized kindness planning system\n- Implement effective reminders for daily acts of kindness\n- Track and reflect on your kindness practice\n\n## Setting Up Your Kindness Planner\n\nYour Kindness Planner can be either digital (using a notes app, calendar, or planner app) or printed (using a notebook or printed template). Choose whichever format works best for your lifestyle.\n\n### Step 1: Set Daily Kindness Goals\n\nStart by setting a specific kindness goal for each day. Be concrete and realistic:\n\n**Examples:**\n- Write a thank-you note to a teacher\n- Help a classmate with homework\n- Compliment three different people\n- Hold the door open for others throughout the day\n- Offer to help a family member with a chore\n\n**Quick Activity:** Take 2 minutes to brainstorm 3-5 kindness acts that would be meaningful in your current situation.\n\n### Step 2: Estimate Time Requirements\n\nFor each kindness act, estimate how much time it will take:\n- Quick acts (1-5 minutes): Compliments, holding doors, texting encouragement\n- Medium acts (5-15 minutes): Writing notes, helping with a small task\n- Longer acts (15+ minutes): Volunteering, helping with bigger projects\n\nThis helps you realistically plan your day and ensures you can follow through.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Trigger Cues\n\nAssign a specific trigger that will remind you to perform your act of kindness:\n- Time-based: \"After lunch, I'll help clean up the cafeteria\"\n- Location-based: \"When I arrive at school, I'll greet the custodian\"\n- Activity-based: \"While waiting in line, I'll let someone go ahead of me\"\n\n**Pro Tip:** Research shows that linking new habits to existing routines increases success rates by 80%!\n\n## Sample Completed Planner Entry\n\n**Date: Monday, October 10**\n- **Kindness Goal:** Write appreciation notes to two friends\n- **Time Estimate:** 10 minutes (5 minutes per note)\n- **Trigger Cue:** After finishing homework, before dinner\n- **Materials Needed:** Notecards, pen\n- **Completion Check:** \u2713 (Completed at 6:30 PM)\n- **Reflection:** Both friends seemed surprised and happy. Made me feel good too!\n\n## Digital Template\n\nAccess your [downloadable Kindness Planner template here](https://excelhs.org/resources/kindness-planner) or use the following format in your preferred digital tool:\n\n| Date | Kindness Goal | Time Estimate | Trigger Cue | Materials | Completed? | Reflection |\n|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n|      |               |               |             |           |            |            |\n\n## Tips for Reminders\n\n1. **Set alarms or notifications** on your phone with specific kindness reminders\n2. **Use visual cues** like sticky notes on your mirror, desk, or locker\n3. **Pair with existing habits** - attach kindness acts to things you already do daily\n4. **Accountability partner** - share your kindness plans with a friend and check in\n5. **Weekly review** - every Sunday, plan your kindness acts for the upcoming week\n\n## Self-Check\nTake a moment to assess your planning:\n- Have you chosen acts that are realistic for your schedule?\n- Did you identify specific triggers that will work for you?\n- Do you have all materials needed for your planned acts?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour Kindness Planner is a powerful tool to help you follow through on your intentions. By making kindness a planned part of your day rather than an afterthought, you'll develop positive habits that become second nature over time. Remember that even small acts can make a big difference in someone's day!\n\n**Next Steps:** Start with just one planned act of kindness tomorrow, and gradually build your kindness practice over time. In the discussion forum, share which kindness act you're planning to try first!\n\n## Additional Resources\n- [Science of Kindness Video](https://excelhs.org/resources/kindness-science) (3 minutes)\n- [Kindness Impact Journal Template](https://excelhs.org/resources/kindness-journal)\n- [Community Service Opportunities Database](https://excelhs.org/community-service)",
