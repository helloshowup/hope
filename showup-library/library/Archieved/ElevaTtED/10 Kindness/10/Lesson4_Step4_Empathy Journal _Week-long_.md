## Tips for Successful Empathy Journaling

1. **Be specific** - Note exact words, facial expressions, or body language you observed
2. **Avoid assumptions** - Focus on what you observed, not what you think someone "should" feel
3. **Be honest** - It's okay if empathy feels difficult sometimes; this is a learning process
4. **Start small** - Even brief observations (5 minutes daily) help build your empathy skills
5. **Review regularly** - Look back at earlier entries to see your progress
6. **Apply to digital interactions** - Notice emotions in texts, social media, or online classes too

## Need Help Getting Started?
If you're having trouble identifying emotions, try using this list as a starting point:
* Joy, excitement, pride, relief
* Sadness, disappointment, grief
* Anger, frustration, annoyance
* Fear, anxiety, nervousness
* Surprise, confusion, curiosity
* Shame, embarrassment, guilt

Remember: Empathy is a skill that grows with practice. Your consistent efforts to understand others' perspectives will strengthen your relationships and help create a more supportive community both online and offline.

## Submission Guidelines
Complete your journal entries throughout the week, then submit your completed journal by [due date]. Your responses will be evaluated based on thoughtfulness, specific observations, and your growth in empathy skillsâ€”not on the particular situations you choose to describe.
