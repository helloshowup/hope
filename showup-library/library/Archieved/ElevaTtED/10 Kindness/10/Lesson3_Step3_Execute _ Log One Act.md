# Execute & Log One Act

# Execute & Log One Act of Kindness

## Overview
In this activity, you will put your kindness planning into action by performing one of the acts of kindness you've previously brainstormed. This hands-on experience allows you to see firsthand the impact of kindness and reflect on the experience.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Select One Act of Kindness
Review the acts of kindness you've planned in previous activities. Choose one act that you can realistically complete within the next 24-48 hours. Select something that:
- Fits your current schedule and responsibilities
- Is appropriate for your situation
- You feel comfortable performing
- Aligns with your personal values

### Step 2: Perform the Act
Within the next 24-48 hours, carry out your chosen act of kindness. Remember that acts of kindness can be simple yet meaningful, such as:
- Helping a family member with a task
- Writing an appreciation note to someone
- Offering assistance to a neighbor
- Complimenting someone sincerely
- Sharing a resource with a classmate
- Volunteering virtually for a cause you care about
- Creating something (art, food, etc.) to share with others

### Step 3: Create Your Kindness Log
After completing your act of kindness, document the following information in your digital journal:

**Date and Time:** Record when you performed the act of kindness.

**Brief Description:** Write 2-3 sentences describing what you did and how you did it.

**Perceived Reaction:** Note how the recipient (if applicable) responded to your kindness. If the act was anonymous or environmental, describe how you felt performing it.

**Your Reflection:** Share what you learned or observed through this experience. Consider:
- How did performing this act affect your mood or outlook?
- What challenges or surprises did you encounter?
- How might this experience influence your future actions?

### Step 4: Submit Your Log
Post your completed kindness log in the course forum thread titled "Kindness Acts Log." Your entry should look similar to this example:

```
Date/Time: October 15, 2:30 PM

Description: I helped my elderly neighbor bring in her groceries when I noticed her struggling with several bags. I offered assistance and carried the heavier items into her kitchen.

Perceived Reaction: She seemed genuinely surprised and grateful. She smiled and thanked me several times, mentioning that her arthritis made carrying groceries difficult.

Reflection: I realized how a small action that took only five minutes of my time could make someone else's day significantly easier. It felt good to help, and I plan to check in with her regularly. This experience reminded me that many people in my community might need assistance but don't always ask for it.
```

## Assessment
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Completion of all parts of the activity
- Thoughtfulness and depth of your reflection
- Authenticity of your experience

Remember: The goal is authentic experience and reflection, not performing the "biggest" act of kindness. Small, genuine acts can be just as meaningful as grand gestures.

## Time Management Tip
Set a specific deadline on your calendar for completing this activity. Breaking it into smaller steps (selecting the act, performing it, and writing your reflection) can make it more manageable, especially if you're balancing other responsibilities.
