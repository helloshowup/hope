# Impact Mapping: The Ripple Effect of Kindness

![Impact Mapping Infographic: A flow diagram showing how a single kind act creates expanding circles of impact. The diagram begins with one person performing a kind act in the center, then expands outward through numbered circles representing: 1) Immediate impact on recipient, 2) Emotional response and potential to inspire, 3) Community-level effects, and 4) Broader societal influence. Each numbered call-out corresponds to reflection questions in your worksheet.]

**Caption:** This impact map illustrates how a single act of kindness creates a ripple effect. Starting from the center with one person's kind action, the influence expands outward through increasingly wider circles. Each numbered section corresponds to a question on your worksheet:

1. The immediate impact on the person receiving kindness
2. How that person's emotional state might change and inspire further kindness
3. The potential community-level effects when kindness spreads
4. The broader societal impact when kindness becomes normalized

## Reflection Activity
As you complete your worksheet, consider how your own kind actions might create similar expanding circles of positive influence in your world. Think about:

* A recent act of kindness you performed or witnessed
* The immediate reaction you observed
* Any "pay it forward" moments that resulted
* How these experiences connect to broader community values

**Remember:** There are no "small" acts of kindness - even seemingly minor actions can create significant ripple effects!
