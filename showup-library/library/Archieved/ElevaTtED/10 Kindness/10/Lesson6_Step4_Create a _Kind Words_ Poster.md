# Create a “Kind Words” Poster

# Creating a "Kind Words" Poster

## Introduction
A "Kind Words" poster is a wonderful way to promote positive communication and create a supportive atmosphere. Today, you'll design your own kind words poster that can be displayed in your classroom, at home, or shared digitally with friends and family.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Design a visually effective poster that communicates positive messages
- Select appropriate encouraging phrases for different situations
- Apply basic design principles including color contrast and typography
- Reflect on the impact of positive communication in daily life

## Poster Template Structure

### 1. Headline Area
Create an eye-catching title for your poster. Examples include:
- "Words That Lift Us Up"
- "Kindness Speaks Volumes"
- "Choose Kind Words"

### 2. Ten Positive Phrases to Include
Select 10 kind phrases from the list below or create your own:
- "You're doing great!"
- "I believe in you"
- "Thank you for being you"
- "Your effort really shows"
- "I appreciate your help"
- "You make a difference"
- "Your kindness matters"
- "I'm proud of you"
- "You brighten my day"
- "You're important to me"
- "Keep going - you've got this!"
- "Your ideas are valuable"

### 3. Simple Illustrations
Add small, simple drawings to complement your kind words:
- Hearts or stars beside phrases
- Smiling faces
- Sunshine or rainbow motifs
- Thumbs up or high-five hands
- Speech bubbles around words

## Design Guidelines

### Color Contrast
- Use high contrast between text and background colors for readability
- Dark text on light backgrounds works well (black on white, dark blue on yellow)
- Avoid red/green combinations as they can be difficult for some people to distinguish

### Font Size and Style
- Headline: Make it large (at least 36pt) and bold
- Kind phrases: Use a clear, readable font at least 18-24pt
- Choose 1-2 font styles maximum for a clean look
- Sans-serif fonts (like Arial, Calibri) are generally easier to read

## Creating and Exporting Your Poster

### Digital Creation Options:
- Use drawing apps on tablets
- Try free design tools like Canva or Google Drawings
- Word processing programs with page layout features

**Pro Tip:** If you're new to digital design tools, Canva offers templates that can help you get started quickly. Look for "poster" templates and customize with your kind words.

### Export Tips:
- Save as PDF for easy printing and sharing
- For digital display, save as JPG or PNG
- If printing, use standard paper sizes (8.5×11" or A4)
- Consider laminating printed posters for durability

## Reflection Questions
After completing your poster, respond to these questions in 2-3 sentences each:

1. How might these kind words impact someone's day? Think about a specific person who might see your poster.

2. When could you use these phrases in your daily interactions? Identify at least two specific situations.

3. Where would displaying this poster have the most positive effect? Why?

4. Which phrase on your poster resonates with you the most personally? Explain why.

## Extension Activity (Optional)
Create a digital version of your poster that can be shared on social media or via email. Consider how you might adapt your design for different digital formats (Instagram, email signature, phone wallpaper).

## Submission Guidelines
Submit your completed poster as a PDF or image file. Include your written responses to the reflection questions in a separate document.

Remember, the words we choose matter. Your kind words poster is not just an art project—it's a reminder of how we can communicate with compassion and respect every day.
