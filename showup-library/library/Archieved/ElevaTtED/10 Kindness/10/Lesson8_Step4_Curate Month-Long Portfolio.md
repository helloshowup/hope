## Reflection Guidance
For each act of kindness, consider these reflection questions:
- What motivated you to choose this particular act?
- How did the recipient(s) respond?
- What emotions did you experience before, during, and after?
- What did this experience teach you about empathy?
- How might this experience influence your future actions?

## Reminder
Remember to document not just what you did, but how it made you feel, how others responded, and what you learned about kindness and empathy through your actions. Your thoughtful reflections are just as important as the acts themselves!

Use this planner to stay organized and make the most of your month-long journey exploring kindness and empathy.
