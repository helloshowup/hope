# Forum Reflection on Daily Encounters

# Forum Reflection on Daily Encounters

## Discussion Prompt: Acts of Kindness

In this forum activity, you'll reflect on kindness in your daily life and share your observations with classmates.

### Your Task:
1. **Share one act of kindness** you observed or participated in during the past week.
2. **Explain who benefited** from this act of kindness.
3. **Describe why it mattered** - how did this small moment make a difference?

### Example:
*"This week, I noticed my neighbor helping an elderly person carry groceries from their car to their apartment. The elderly person benefited by receiving needed assistance with a physically challenging task. This mattered because it showed how a simple five-minute action could make someone else's day significantly easier and demonstrated care within our community."*

### Response Requirements:
* Your initial post should be 4-6 sentences.
* After posting your reflection, respond thoughtfully to at least one classmate's post within 3 days.
* Your response should acknowledge their observation and add a constructive comment or question.

### Grading Criteria:
* Initial post (70%): Clearly describes an act of kindness, who benefited, and why it mattered
* Response to classmate (30%): Shows thoughtful engagement with peer's experience
* All posts maintain a respectful tone and positive focus

### Time Management Tip:
* Set aside 15-20 minutes to write your initial post and another 10 minutes later in the week to respond to a classmate.

This reflection connects to our learning objective: "Define kindness and empathy" by helping us recognize how these qualities appear in everyday interactions.
