# Role-Switch Reflection

# Role-Switch Reflection

## Understanding Perspectives

In this activity, you'll practice empathy by stepping into someone else's shoes. Empathy helps us understand conflicts better and build stronger relationships with our peers.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop perspective-taking skills by viewing a conflict from another person's viewpoint
- Analyze how emotions and needs influence behavior during disagreements
- Create balanced conflict resolutions that address multiple perspectives

## Assignment Instructions

### Part 1: Your Reflection (150-word minimum)
Think about a recent conflict or disagreement you had with someone. This could be with a friend, family member, classmate, or teammate. Write a reflection that:

1. Retells the conflict entirely from the OTHER person's perspective
2. Includes what they might have been feeling during the conflict
3. Describes what needs they were trying to meet
4. Suggests a resolution that would have satisfied both parties

Remember to write in first person AS IF YOU WERE THE OTHER PERSON. For example: "I felt frustrated when..."

### Part 2: Peer Response
After posting your reflection, read through your classmates' posts and respond thoughtfully to at least one. In your response:
- Comment on their ability to see the situation from another perspective
- Share any additional insights about the conflict they described
- Offer supportive feedback on their suggested resolution

## Example Reflection
"From my perspective as Alex, I felt ignored when I was trying to explain my idea for our group project. I needed to feel heard and valued as a team member. When my suggestion was quickly dismissed without discussion, I felt that my contributions weren't important to the group. I was frustrated because I had spent time researching my idea and believed it would help us create a better project. What I really needed was acknowledgment of my effort and a fair consideration of my suggestion. A better resolution would have been if the group had taken five minutes to hear my complete idea, asked clarifying questions, and then discussed how elements of it might be incorporated into our final plan."

- Post your reflection (minimum 150 words) to the discussion board by [due date]
- Respond to at least one classmate's post with thoughtful feedback (minimum 75 words) by [response due date]
