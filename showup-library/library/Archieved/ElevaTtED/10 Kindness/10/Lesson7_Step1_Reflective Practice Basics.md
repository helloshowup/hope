# Reflective Practice Basics: The Kindness Reflection Cycle

## Video Script: Understanding the Reflection Cycle

**OPENING SCENE:** 
[Friendly narrator appears on screen with a circular diagram showing the reflection cycle]

**NARRATOR:** 
Welcome to our lesson on Reflective Practice Basics! Today, we're going to learn how reflection can help us grow in kindness and empathy. Reflection isn't just thinking about what happenedâ€”it's a powerful tool that helps us become better people and more successful students.

**SECTION 1: DEFINING THE REFLECTION CYCLE**

**NARRATOR:** 
The reflection cycle has three main parts that work together:

1. **Experience** - This is something that happens in your life involving kindness or empathy. Maybe you helped someone who was sad, shared with a friend, or missed an opportunity to be kind.

2. **Analyze** - This is where you think deeply about what happened. How did you feel? How did others feel? What went well? What could have gone differently?

3. **Adjust** - Based on what you learned, you make a plan for how you might handle similar situations in the future. This helps you grow in kindness, empathy, and personal responsibility.

**SECTION 2: ANIMATED EXAMPLE**

**NARRATOR:** 
Let's see how this works with an animated example!

[Animation begins showing a student named Alex in the school cafeteria]

**NARRATOR:** 
**Experience:** Alex notices a new student sitting alone at lunch looking uncomfortable. Alex feels like they should invite the student to join their table but feels nervous and walks past instead.

[Animation shows Alex later that day looking thoughtful]

**NARRATOR:** 
**Analyze:** Later, Alex reflects on what happened. Alex realizes the new student probably felt lonely. Alex identifies that fear of awkwardness prevented taking action. Alex remembers how it felt to be new once and wishes someone had reached out.

[Animation shows Alex making notes in a journal]

**NARRATOR:** 
**Adjust:** Alex decides that next time, they'll overcome their nervousness by preparing a simple friendly greeting. Alex makes a plan to look for the new student tomorrow and invite them to sit together.

[Animation shows the next day where Alex successfully invites the new student to join]

**NARRATOR:** 
And the cycle continues! After this new experience, Alex can reflect again on how it went and keep growing in kindness.

**SECTION 3: REFLECTION PROMPTS**

**NARRATOR:** 
Here are some helpful prompts you can use for your own kindness reflection:

[Text appears on screen as narrator reads each one]

**Experience Prompts:**
* What kind actions did I take today?
* Did I miss any opportunities to show kindness?
* How did others show kindness to me?

**Analysis Prompts:**
* How did my actions make others feel?
* What emotions did I experience during this situation?
* What values guided my choices?
* What barriers prevented me from being kind?

**Adjustment Prompts:**
* What would I do differently next time?
* What small step can I take tomorrow to be more kind?
* How can I prepare for similar situations?
* Who could help me practice being more kind?

**SECTION 4: APPLYING REFLECTION TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS**

**NARRATOR:**
The reflection cycle isn't just for social situations - it's a powerful tool for academic growth too!

For example:
* **Experience:** Receiving feedback on an assignment
* **Analyze:** Identifying patterns in your mistakes and strengths
* **Adjust:** Creating a specific study plan to address weak areas

This same cycle can help you improve your time management, study habits, and overall academic performance at Excel High School.

**CLOSING:**

**NARRATOR:** 
Remember, reflection isn't about judging yourself harshly. It's about growing and learning! By regularly using this reflection cycle, you'll develop stronger kindness, empathy, and self-management skills that will benefit you in school, relationships, and future careers.

Now it's your turn to practice reflection using these prompts in your own life! Your next activity will guide you through creating your first reflection entry.
