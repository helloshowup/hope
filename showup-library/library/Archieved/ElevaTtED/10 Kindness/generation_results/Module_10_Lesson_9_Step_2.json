    "<educational_content>\n# Initiative Brainstorm Board\n\n## Purpose\nThis collaborative forum allows us to generate and share ideas for kindness initiatives that can positively impact our school and broader community. By working together, we can identify meaningful ways to promote kindness in our daily lives.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Post Your Ideas\nCreate a new thread with THREE initiative ideas that could foster kindness. For each idea:\n* Provide a clear title and brief description (2-3 sentences)\n* Tag each idea with an appropriate theme (e.g., #SchoolSpirit, #CommunityOutreach, #MentalHealth, #EnvironmentalKindness)\n* Indicate the scale of the initiative (#Individual, #SmallGroup, #WholeSchool, #Community)\n\n### Step 2: Engage with Peers\n* Review your classmates' ideas\n* \"Like\" or react to at least 3 ideas that resonate with you\n* Comment constructively on at least 2 different threads with thoughts or suggestions\n\n### Step 3: Collaborative Summary\n* Our facilitator will compile and summarize the most popular themes and ideas\n* The summary will highlight potential initiatives for implementation\n* Top ideas may be selected for further development\n\n## Example Post\n```\nMy Kindness Initiative Ideas:\n\n1. \"Gratitude Notes Station\" - Set up a table with note cards and pens in the cafeteria where students can write thank-you notes to staff, teachers, or peers. #Appreciation #MentalHealth #WholeSchool\n\n2. \"New Student Welcome Committee\" - Create a volunteer group to help new students navigate their first week, introducing them to others and showing them around. #Inclusion #SchoolSpirit #SmallGroup\n\n3. \"Community Garden Project\" - Establish a small garden on campus where students can grow vegetables to donate to local food banks. #EnvironmentalKindness #CommunityOutreach #WholeSchool\n```\n\nRemember, the goal is to generate ideas that are realistic, meaningful, and can create a lasting impact on our culture of kindness!\n</educational_content>",
