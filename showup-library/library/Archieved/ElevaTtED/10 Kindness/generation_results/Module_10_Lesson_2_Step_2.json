    "<educational_content>\n# Impact Mapping: The Ripple Effect of Kindness\n\n![Impact Mapping Infographic: A flow diagram showing how a single kind act creates expanding circles of impact. The diagram begins with one person performing a kind act in the center, then shows ripples expanding outward through family, community, and society. Each circle is numbered 1-4 to correspond with the questions in your worksheet.]\n\n**Caption:** This impact map illustrates how a single act of kindness can create a powerful ripple effect. Starting with just one person (1), kindness spreads outward to affect those directly involved (2), extends to witnesses and the broader community (3), and ultimately contributes to positive social change (4). Each numbered call-out corresponds to a reflection question in your companion worksheet, guiding you to explore how your own kind actions can create meaningful impact at multiple levels. As you work through the questions, consider how even small gestures of kindness can initiate significant positive change that extends far beyond the initial interaction.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Impact Mapping: The Ripple Effect of Kindness\n\n![Impact Mapping Infographic: A flow diagram showing how a single kind act creates expanding circles of impact. The diagram begins with one person performing a kind act in the center, then expands outward through numbered circles representing: 1) Immediate impact on recipient, 2) Emotional response and potential to inspire, 3) Community-level effects, and 4) Broader societal influence. Each numbered call-out corresponds to reflection questions in your worksheet.]\n\n**Caption:** This impact map illustrates how a single act of kindness creates a ripple effect. Starting from the center with one person's kind action, the influence expands outward through increasingly wider circles. Each numbered section corresponds to a question on your worksheet:\n\n1. The immediate impact on the person receiving kindness\n2. How that person's emotional state might change and inspire further kindness\n3. The potential community-level effects when kindness spreads\n4. The broader societal impact when kindness becomes normalized\n\nAs you complete your worksheet, consider how your own kind actions might create similar expanding circles of positive influence in your world.\n</educational_content>",
    "<educational_content>\n# Impact Mapping: The Ripple Effect of Kindness\n\n![Impact Mapping Infographic: A flow diagram showing how a single kind act creates expanding circles of impact. Starting with \"YOU\" at the center, the kindness radiates outward through increasingly larger circles labeled: (1) IMMEDIATE IMPACT, (2) EXTENDED IMPACT, (3) COMMUNITY IMPACT, and (4) GLOBAL POTENTIAL. Each circle shows how kindness grows from affecting one person to potentially influencing countless others worldwide. Arrows connect each circle, demonstrating how the impact flows outward. Small illustrations represent people being helped at each level.]\n\n**Caption:** This impact map illustrates how a single act of kindness can create a powerful ripple effect. Beginning with you (center), your kind action first affects someone directly (1), who may then pass that kindness to others in their circle (2). As more people experience and share kindness, it spreads throughout your community (3) and potentially contributes to positive change across society (4). The numbered call-outs correspond to the questions in your companion worksheet, helping you explore each level of impact in detail.\n\n*Companion worksheet will guide students through reflection questions about each numbered impact level, allowing them to trace how their own kind actions might create widening circles of positive change.*\n</educational_content>"
