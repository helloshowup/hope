Each numbered element represents an intentional design choice that supports diverse learners.\n\n**Inclusivity Features:**\n1. Flexible seating arrangements\n2. Accessible pathways (36\" minimum width)\n3. Quiet corner with noise-reducing panels\n4. Visual schedule and classroom expectations\n5. Diverse cultural representation in displays\n6. Technology station with adaptive equipment\n7. Reading area with multi-level seating options\n\n**Areas Needing Improvement:**\n\u2192 Teacher desk creates barrier to student interaction\n\u2192 Limited natural light from covered windows\n\u2192 Congested area near supply shelves\n\u2192 Lack of small-group collaboration spaces\n\n**Guiding Questions:**\n* How might the seating arrangement be modified to better support collaborative learning?\n* What changes would make resources more accessible to all students?\n* How could visual elements be adjusted to reduce sensory overload?\n* What physical barriers might impact students with mobility challenges?\n* How does this layout support or hinder classroom community?\n</educational_content>",
