Do you have a minute?\" Jenna asked, clutching a small envelope.\n\n\"Of course, Jenna. What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to give you this before graduation.\" Jenna handed over the envelope containing a handwritten letter. \"You helped me find my voice when I didn't think I had one. The college scholarship I got for creative writing wouldn't have happened without you pushing me to submit my stories.\"\n\nMs. Rodriguez read the letter, her eyes growing misty. \"This means more to me than you know, Jenna.
