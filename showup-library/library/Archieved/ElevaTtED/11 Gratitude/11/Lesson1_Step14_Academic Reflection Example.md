## Key Elements of Effective Academic Reflection

1. **Honest Assessment**: The reflection acknowledges real struggles without making excuses.

3. **Recognition of Growth**: The reflection highlights specific achievements that demonstrate progress.

4. **Specific Action Plan**: The student creates concrete, measurable steps for continued improvement.
