# Holistic Impact Evaluation

# Holistic Impact Evaluation

## Reflection Activity

### Past Challenge Reflection Prompt
Think about a significant challenge you've faced in the past year. This could be academic, personal, social, or related to your physical or mental well-being. Consider a situation that initially seemed difficult but ultimately contributed to your growth in some way.

### Instructions
1. Write a 150-200 word analysis addressing:
   - What was the specific challenge?
   - How did you respond to it?
   - What did you learn from this experience?
   - How has this challenge shaped who you are today?
   - What aspects of this experience are you grateful for now?

2. Rate your growth on the following 5-point self-growth scale:
   1. **Initial Awareness**: I recognize this was a challenge but haven't processed it fully
   2. **Processing**: I'm working through the emotions and lessons
   3. **Acceptance**: I've accepted what happened and am finding meaning
   4. **Integration**: I've incorporated lessons into my daily life
   5. **Transformation**: This challenge has fundamentally changed me in positive ways

3. Post your reflection and self-rating to the class forum by [specific date]. You'll then have the opportunity to read and respond to at least two classmates' experiences by [specific date].

4. **Tip for Success**: There are no "right" or "wrong" responses here. The goal is honest self-reflection that helps you recognize your own resilience and growth.

### Why This Matters
This exercise helps you recognize how challenges contribute to your holistic development and practice gratitude for the growth that comes from difficult experiences. These reflection skills are valuable both academically and in your personal life.
