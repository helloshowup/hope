Find a comfortable seated position with your feet flat on the floor\n2. Place your hands on your lap or on your desk\n3. Close your eyes or soften your gaze\n4. Breathe in slowly through your nose for a count of 4\n5. Hold your breath for a count of 1\n6. Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 4\n7. Repeat this breathing pattern 5-10 times\n8.

Did you notice any change in your focus?\n\n## Step 2: Gratitude Journaling (5 minutes)\n1. Open your journal to a fresh page\n2. Write today's date at the top\n3. Create a heading: \"Things I'm Grateful For\"\n4. Think about two things you appreciate in your life right now\n   - Consider aspects of your education, relationships, personal growth, or daily experiences\n5. For your first entry, write one thing you're grateful for and why it matters to you\n6. For your second entry, write about another thing you're grateful for, being specific about what you appreciate about it\n7. Take a moment to re-read what you've written\n\n**Example:** \"I'm grateful for my Success Coach at Excel High School because they took extra time yesterday to help me understand the assignment requirements.\"\n\n## Step 3: Labeling Emotions (3 minutes)\n1. Create a new heading: \"How I Feel Today\"\n2. Take a moment to check in with yourself\n3. Identify and write down 2-3 emotions you're experiencing\n4. For each emotion, rate its intensity on a scale of 1-10\n5. Write a brief sentence about what might be causing each emotion\n\n**Emotion Vocabulary Bank:**\n- Accomplished\n- Anxious\n- Confident\n- Confused\n- Determined\n- Discouraged\n- Engaged\n- Frustrated\n- Hopeful\n- Overwhelmed\n- Proud\n- Relieved\n\n## Step 4: Academic Connection (3 minutes)\n1.

Identify one small step you can take today to address this challenge\n\n## Step 5: Save and Reflect (2-3 minutes)\n1. Review what you've written in your journal\n2. Notice if your mood has shifted since beginning this exercise\n3. Write a brief reflection: \"After journaling, I now feel...\"\n4. Close your journal, knowing you can return to it anytime\n5. Take one final deep breath before continuing with your day\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations on completing this guided journaling demonstration! Regular practice of these techniques can help build emotional awareness, cultivate gratitude, and improve overall well-being and academic performance. Try to incorporate this practice into your routine, even if just for a few minutes each day.\n\nRemember, there's no \"right way\" to journal - the most important thing is consistency and honesty with yourself.
