  "edit_summary": "I maintained the core quiz content while making two important additions:\n\n1. Added a \"Remember\" section that reinforces Excel High School's competency-based approach by explicitly stating students can retake the quiz until they master the content.\n\n2. Added a \"Study Tip\" that encourages personal connection to the material, supporting the school's emphasis on real-world relevance and engagement.\n\nThese additions support the school's instructional design drivers, particularly \"Mastery-Led Feedback\" and \"Self-Direction Aids,\" while maintaining the clarity and purpose of the original assessment. The additions also help frame the quiz as a learning opportunity rather than just an evaluation."
