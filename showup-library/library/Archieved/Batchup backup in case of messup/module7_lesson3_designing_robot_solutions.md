# Designing Robot Solutions
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Develop comprehensive robot design plans that address specific problems
- Select appropriate sensors, processors, and actuators based on the input-processing-output framework
- Incorporate ethical considerations into robot design decisions
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Input-Processing-Output Framework for Effective Robot Design
This podcast explores how the IPO framework provides a structured approach for selecting and integrating components in robotics solutions.
## From Problem to Design Specifications
This section covers the methodology for transforming identified problems into concrete design specifications for robotic solutions.
### Translating Requirements into Specifications
This subsection examines how to convert user needs and problem requirements into technical specifications that guide robot design.
### Setting Design Parameters
This subsection explores establishing measurable parameters that define robot performance expectations.
### Creating Design Constraints
This subsection addresses identifying and documenting limitations that will impact the robot design process.
## Input Component Selection
This section focuses on selecting appropriate sensors based on the information needs of the robotic solution.
### Matching Sensors to Information Needs
This subsection covers methodologies for selecting sensors that gather the specific data required for the robot's function.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot you might design to solve a real-world problem. What types of information would this robot need to gather from its environment, and what sensors would be most appropriate for collecting this data?

### Environmental Considerations for Sensors
This subsection examines how environmental factors affect sensor selection and performance.
### Sensor Placement and Configuration
This subsection covers strategies for optimal positioning of sensors to maximize data collection effectiveness.
## **Activity 1: Robot Blueprint Creation**
Using the provided template, develop a detailed design plan that specifies all inputs, processing algorithms, and outputs for a robot designed to solve a specific challenge of your choice. Include diagrams indicating sensor placement, processor specifications, and actuator configurations that directly address the problem requirements.
## Processing Component Planning
This section addresses how to design the "brain" of the robot that processes input data and determines outputs.
### Algorithm Development
This subsection covers approaches to creating algorithms that transform sensor data into meaningful information.
### Decision Logic Design
This subsection explores methods for designing decision pathways that determine robot behavior based on processed inputs.
### Programming Considerations
This subsection addresses programming languages, structures, and frameworks appropriate for different robotics applications.
## Output Component Selection
This section focuses on selecting appropriate actuators and feedback mechanisms for robot responses.
### Choosing Appropriate Actuators
This subsection covers matching actuator types to the specific movement and action requirements of the robot.
### Power and Movement Requirements
This subsection addresses calculating power needs and selecting motors based on performance requirements.
### Feedback Mechanisms
This subsection explores how to implement feedback systems that verify action completion and accuracy.
## **Activity 2: Ethical Design Checklist**
Review your robot blueprint design using the provided ethical considerations checklist. Evaluate your design for safety features, privacy protections, accessibility considerations, and environmental impact. Modify your design to address any ethical concerns identified, documenting the changes and their justifications.
## Ethical Design Considerations
This section addresses ethical principles that should be incorporated throughout the robot design process.
### Safety in Robot Design
This subsection explores implementing safety features and fail-safes to prevent harm to users and bystanders.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider what potential unintended consequences your robot design might have, and think about specific design modifications you could implement to mitigate these risks.

### Privacy and Data Collection
This subsection addresses responsible data collection, processing, and storage in robot systems.
### Accessibility and Inclusivity
This subsection explores designing robots that can be used by people with diverse abilities and needs.
### **Check your understanding**
When designing a line-following robot, which of the following represents the most appropriate application of the input-processing-output framework?
A. Input: Motors, Processing: Light sensors, Output: Program code
B. Input: Light sensors, Processing: Decision algorithm, Output: Motor activation
C. Input: Battery, Processing: Motors, Output: Movement
D. Input: Program code, Processing: Battery, Output: Sensors
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. Input: Light sensors, Processing: Decision algorithm, Output: Motor activation. In a line-following robot, light sensors detect the line (input), a decision algorithm processes this information to determine position relative to the line (processing), and motors are activated to adjust the robot's direction accordingly (output). This properly represents the flow of information through the robot system. If you chose a different answer, review the input-processing-output framework to ensure you understand how information flows through a robot system.
## Key Takeaways
- Effective robot designs directly address the identified problem with appropriate components selected for specific purposes
- The input-processing-output framework provides a structured approach to selecting and integrating robot components
- Ethical considerations like safety, privacy, and accessibility should be incorporated throughout the design process

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 7.3
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 7 in the following ways:**
- This lesson builds on the problem definition and research from Lesson 2, focusing on translating those insights into concrete design plans
- It prepares students for implementation and testing in Lesson 4 by ensuring they have comprehensive design specifications
- It reinforces the systematic approach to robotics design established throughout the module
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Component Matchmaker - An interactive design challenge where students are given specific robotics problems and must select the most appropriate inputs, processing methods, and outputs from a collection of options. Example: Designing a robot that can sort recycling materials by type requires matching appropriate sensors (color/material sensors), decision algorithms (material classification), and sorting mechanisms (servo-controlled gates).
