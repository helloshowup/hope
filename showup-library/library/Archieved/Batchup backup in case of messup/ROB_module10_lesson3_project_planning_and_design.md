# Project Planning and Design
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Apply the engineering design process to develop a detailed project plan addressing a specific problem or purpose
- Create initial designs or specifications incorporating the input-processing-output framework
- Integrate ethical considerations into the project planning process from the beginning
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Ethical Design in Robotics Projects
A discussion on how proactively integrating ethical considerations into the early stages of robotics project planning leads to more responsible and effective solutions.
## Defining Your Project Scope
This section covers establishing clear boundaries for your robotics project, ensuring a well-defined focus before beginning development.
### Problem Statement Development
Techniques for crafting clear, specific problem statements that guide project development.
### User Needs Analysis
Methods for identifying and analyzing the needs of potential users to inform design decisions.
### Setting Clear Project Boundaries
Approaches to defining what is and isn't included in your project scope to prevent scope creep.
## **Activity 1: Guided Design Workshop**
Complete the structured design template that walks you through defining your problem, sketching initial designs, identifying input-processing-output components, and developing a basic project plan. Focus particularly on creating a clear problem statement and identifying your primary user group's needs.
## Research and Background
Understanding how to gather and analyze information relevant to your project to build on existing knowledge.
### Finding Relevant Information
Strategies for locating credible sources and existing knowledge related to your project.
### Analyzing Existing Solutions
Techniques for evaluating similar solutions to understand strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for innovation.
### Identifying Applicable Technologies
Methods for determining which technologies are most appropriate for addressing your problem statement.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** How does your project address a specific problem or need? Think about who would benefit from your solution and why this problem matters in a real-world context.

## Initial Design Development
Approaches to creating the first concrete designs for your robotics project using structured frameworks.
### Sketching and Visualization
Techniques for visually representing your ideas to communicate and refine design concepts.
### Applying the Input-Processing-Output Framework
Methods for structuring your design around the core components of inputs (sensors), processing (algorithms), and outputs (actuators).
### Materials and Components Selection
Considerations for choosing appropriate materials and components based on project requirements and constraints.
### **Check your understanding**
When applying the input-processing-output framework to your robotics project, which of the following would be classified as PROCESSING?
A. A touch sensor detecting when an object is grasped
B. A motor turning wheels to move the robot forward
C. An algorithm determining how to navigate around obstacles
D. A light that turns on when a task is completed
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. An algorithm determining how to navigate around obstacles. The processing component involves the decision-making algorithms and logic that determine the robot's behavior based on inputs. If you chose a different answer, remember that the touch sensor is an input device that gathers information, while the motor and light are output devices that affect the environment based on the processing decisions.
## Project Planning Tools
Essential tools and methodologies to organize and plan your robotics project development process.
### Creating a Project Timeline
Techniques for establishing realistic schedules and milestones for project completion.
### Resource Planning
Methods for identifying, securing, and managing the resources needed for your project.
### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Approaches to identifying potential obstacles and planning responses to keep your project on track.
## **Activity 2: Peer Design Review**
Present your initial project plans to a small group of peers who will provide structured feedback using the provided review guide. Focus on gathering insights about the feasibility of your design, clarity of your problem statement, and alignment with project requirements. Use this feedback to refine your project plan.
## Ethical Design Considerations
Integrating ethical thinking into your design process from the beginning to create responsible robotic solutions.
### Safety and Accessibility
Considerations for ensuring your design is safe for users and accessible to diverse populations.
### Environmental Impact
Methods for evaluating and minimizing the environmental footprint of your project.
### Social Implications
Approaches to considering the broader social consequences of your robotics project.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** What aspects of your design might present ethical considerations? Identify at least two ethical implications that might arise from your project and briefly describe how you plan to address these proactively.

## Key Takeaways
- A well-defined problem statement and clear project scope are essential foundations for successful project development
- Applying the input-processing-output framework helps ensure your design includes all necessary components for a functional system
- Considering ethical implications from the beginning leads to more responsible and effective robot designs

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 10.3
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 10 in the following ways:**
- It moves students from concept to concrete planning, guiding them through the crucial initial stages of their final project
- It ensures students have a solid foundation before moving into development work
- It establishes the parameters that will guide their project throughout the remainder of the module
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Challenge Cards: Robot Design Challenge Cards where students receive random challenge cards that add constraints or requirements to their projects (e.g., 'Must work in low light conditions' or 'Must be accessible to users with limited dexterity'). They must quickly adapt their designs to accommodate these factors, building flexibility and resourcefulness.
