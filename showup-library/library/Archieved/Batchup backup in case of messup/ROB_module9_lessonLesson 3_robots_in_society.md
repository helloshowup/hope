# [h1] Robots in Society
## [h2] Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Describe how robotics and automation impact different types of jobs and industries
- Explain the purpose and importance of rules and regulations for robots
- Develop appropriate guidelines for responsible robot behavior
### [h2] Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Evolving Landscape of Jobs in a Robotic Future
This podcast explores how robotics and automation are transforming various industries and the implications for workers, employers, and society.
## [h2] Automation and Employment
This section examines the complex relationship between robotics, automation, and the workforce, exploring both challenges and opportunities.
### [h3] Jobs Transformed by Robotics
This subsection looks at specific industries and occupations that have been significantly changed by robotics implementation, highlighting the shift in required skills and responsibilities.
### [h3] Historical Context of Technological Change
This subsection provides historical examples of technological revolutions and their impacts on employment, drawing parallels to current robotics adoption.
### [h3] New Opportunities Created by Robotics
This subsection explores emerging job markets, roles, and career paths that have been created due to advances in robotics and automation.
## [h2] **Activity 1: Robot Job Transformation Debate**
In this activity, you'll work in small groups to role-play different perspectives on how robots affect specific occupations. Choose either the perspective of a worker, employer, or robot designer for an industry of your choice. Prepare arguments about how robotics will impact this industry, then present your perspective to the class. Consider both potential benefits and challenges from your assigned viewpoint.
## [h2] Rules, Regulations, and Laws for Robots
This section discusses the importance of establishing guidelines and regulations for robot design, deployment, and operation.
### [h3] Why We Need Rules for Robots
This subsection examines safety concerns, ethical considerations, and societal impacts that necessitate the creation of rules governing robotics.
### [h3] Existing Robotics Regulations
This subsection surveys current regulations, standards, and policies related to robotics across different countries and industries.
### [h3] Asimov's Three Laws and Beyond
This subsection analyzes Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics and discusses their limitations, modern interpretations, and alternative approaches to robot ethics.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider your own future career path and how it might be affected by increased robotics and automation. What specific skills might you need to develop to thrive in a more automated workplace?

## [h2] Cultural Perspectives on Robots
This section explores how different cultures and societies view, adopt, and integrate robots into their communities.
### [h3] Different Cultural Views on Automation
This subsection compares and contrasts attitudes toward robots and automation across various global cultures and societies.
### [h3] Robots in Various Societies
This subsection examines case studies of robot integration in different countries, highlighting successes, challenges, and cultural adaptations.
### [h3] Ensuring Cultural Sensitivity in Robot Design
This subsection discusses the importance of considering cultural context when designing and implementing robotic solutions.
## [h2] **Activity 2: Create Your Own Robot Laws**
After studying Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, develop your own updated set of rules or guidelines for modern robots. Consider how these laws would apply to different types of robots (industrial, social, medical, etc.). Write a brief justification for each rule, explaining why it's important and how it addresses potential concerns. Be prepared to share and discuss your laws with classmates.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** If you were tasked with creating laws for robots in your community, what would be your most important rule and why? Consider the potential consequences if your rule was not implemented.

### **[h3] Check your understanding**
Which statement best describes the typical impact of automation on employment?
A. Robots completely replace all human workers in every industry
B. Robots create new jobs but have no effect on existing jobs
C. Robots tend to transform jobs and eliminate some roles while creating new opportunities
D. Robots only affect manufacturing jobs and no other industries
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. Robots tend to transform jobs and eliminate some roles while creating new opportunities. Historically, automation has transformed the nature of work rather than eliminating it entirely. While some specific jobs may be eliminated, new roles typically emerge that require different skills, often involving the design, maintenance, or supervision of automated systems. If you chose a different answer, remember that technological change typically reshapes rather than completely eliminates human work.
## [h2] Key Takeaways
- Robots and automation transform the nature of work, eliminating some jobs while creating new opportunities that require different skill sets
- Rules and regulations for robots are necessary to ensure safety, privacy, and ethical use in various contexts and applications
- Cultural perspectives on robots vary globally and should be considered in robot design and implementation to ensure appropriate adoption
[End of Lesson]
## Instructional designer notes of lesson 9.3
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 9 in the following ways:**
- It expands the ethical discussion beyond individual interactions to broader societal implications
- It connects personal robot design choices to larger impacts on jobs and communities
- It builds on previous lessons by considering robots within social, cultural and economic contexts
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Debate game - Future Job Invention: Students imagine and describe new jobs that might exist in the future because of advances in robotics, then explain what these jobs would involve and what skills would be needed. For example, students might propose roles like "Robot Ethics Consultant," "Human-Robot Integration Specialist," or "Automated System Experience Designer."
