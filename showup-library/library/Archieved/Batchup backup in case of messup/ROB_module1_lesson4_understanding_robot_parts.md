# Understanding Robot Parts
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Categorize robot parts according to the input-processing-output framework
- Compare specific robot parts to human body parts with similar functions
- Explain how different robot parts work together as a system
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Robot Parts vs. Human Body Parts
This podcast will explore the fascinating parallels between robot components and human anatomy, highlighting both similarities in function and differences in implementation.
## Input Components: How Robots Sense
This section introduces how robots perceive their environment through various sensing mechanisms.
### Types of Sensors and Their Functions
Content will cover common robot sensors including light sensors, proximity sensors, touch sensors, and microphones, explaining how each functions to collect specific types of environmental data.
### How Sensors Collect Data
Content will explain the process of converting physical phenomena into electrical signals that robots can interpret.
### Comparing Robot Sensors to Human Senses
Content will draw parallels between robot sensors and human sensory organs, discussing similarities and limitations.
## **Activity 1: Robot-Human Comparison Chart**
Create a simple visual chart that compares robot sensors with human senses. For example, match cameras with eyes, microphones with ears, and touch sensors with skin. For each pair, note one similarity in function and one difference in how they work. This will help you understand both the inspiration behind robot design and the unique challenges of artificial sensing.
## Processing Components: How Robots Think
This section explores the "brain" of a robot and how it processes information from sensors.
### Robot Brains: Controllers and Computers
Content will describe the various types of controllers and computers that serve as robot brains, from simple microcontrollers to complex computer systems.
### Memory and Programming
Content will explain how robots store information and follow programmed instructions.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about your own decision-making process when you encounter new information from your senses. How does this compare to how a robot processes input from its sensors?

### Decision-Making in Robots
Content will cover how robots use algorithms to make decisions based on sensor inputs.
## Output Components: How Robots Act
This section covers how robots interact with the world through movement and manipulation.
### Motors and Movement
Content will explain different types of motors and how they enable robot movement and locomotion.
### Grippers and Manipulators
Content will describe the end effectors that allow robots to interact with objects in their environment.
### Other Action Components
Content will introduce additional output devices like speakers, lights, and displays that robots use to communicate.
## **Activity 2: Design Your Robot**
Sketch a simple robot designed for a specific task of your choosing (like cleaning your room, helping in a hospital, or exploring Mars). Label each component according to whether it serves as input (sensing), processing (thinking), or output (acting). For each component, write a brief note explaining why it's necessary for your robot's intended purpose. This exercise will help you apply the input-processing-output framework to practical robot design.
## Putting It All Together: Robot Systems
This section examines how all robot components work together as an integrated system.
### How Components Work Together
Content will explain the interconnections between input, processing, and output components.
### Power Systems and Support Structures
Content will describe how robots are powered and physically constructed to support their components.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** If you could design a new sensor for robots that doesn't exist yet, what would it do and why would it be useful? Consider what capabilities this would add to existing robot systems.

### Making Robot Systems More Effective
Content will discuss strategies for optimizing robot systems through better integration of components.
### **Check your understanding**
Which component helps a robot transition from sensing to acting?
A. Wheels
B. Batteries
C. Cameras
D. Microcontroller
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is D. Microcontroller. The microcontroller is the processing component (brain) of the robot that takes information from sensors (input) and determines what actions the output components (like motors and speakers) should take, making it the critical link between sensing and acting. If you chose a different answer, remember that wheels and cameras are output and input components respectively, while batteries provide power but don't process information.
## Key Takeaways
- Robot parts can be categorized by their role in the input-processing-output framework, providing a clear way to understand their functions
- Many robot components have analogies to human body parts, but work differently due to technological limitations and different design approaches
- All robot components must work together as a system to accomplish tasks effectively, highlighting the importance of integration in robotics

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 1.4
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 1 in the following ways:**
- This lesson completes the foundational understanding of robots by examining their physical components in relation to the input-processing-output framework established in Lesson 1
- It builds upon previous lessons by applying the conceptual framework to concrete physical components
- It prepares students for more advanced topics in subsequent modules by ensuring they understand the basic building blocks of robot systems
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Build and Label game: Robot Designer - Using a drag-and-drop interface, students build a virtual robot by selecting appropriate components from each category (input, processing, output) and explaining why each component is necessary for their robot's intended task. For example, students might choose cameras (input), a specific microcontroller (processing), and servo motors (output) to create a robot that can identify and pick up objects of certain colors.
