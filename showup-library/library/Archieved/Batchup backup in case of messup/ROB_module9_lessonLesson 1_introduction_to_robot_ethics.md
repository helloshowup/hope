# Introduction to Robot Ethics
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Define what ethics means in the context of robotics and explain its importance
- Identify ethical considerations at each stage of the input-processing-output framework
- Analyze what makes a robot's design and function ethically positive or problematic
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Defining Ethics in Robotics and Its Growing Importance
A discussion exploring what makes robot ethics distinct from traditional ethics and why it matters increasingly in our automated world.
## What are Robot Ethics?
This section introduces the concept of ethics specifically in robotics technology.
### Defining Ethics in Technology
Content explaining foundational ethical concepts in technology contexts.
### Why Ethics Matter in Robotics
Content exploring the importance of ethical considerations in robotic development and deployment.
### Real-World Examples of Ethical Considerations
Content providing concrete examples of ethical dilemmas in current robotic technologies.
## **Activity 1: Robot Ethics Sorting Game**
Sort the provided robot scenarios into three categories: ethically positive, ethically concerning, or ethically complex. For each scenario, write a brief justification explaining your categorization based on the potential benefits, harms, or unresolved questions.
## Ethics in the Input-Processing-Output Framework
This section explores ethical considerations at different stages of robot operation.
### Ethical Considerations at the Input Stage
Content explaining ethical issues related to how robots gather information.
### Ethics in Processing and Decision-Making
Content addressing ethical concerns in how robots process data and make decisions.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a robot you've seen in movies or real life. What ethical considerations might be important for this robot? Consider who might be affected by the robot's functioning and what potential benefits or harms might result.

### Ethics in Outputs and Robot Actions
Content examining ethical implications of robot behaviors and actions.
## Evaluating the Ethics of Robot Design
This section provides frameworks for assessing robotic designs from an ethical perspective.
### Criteria for Ethical Evaluation
Content outlining standards for ethical assessment of robotic technology.
### Balancing Benefits and Potential Harms
Content discussing approaches to weighing positive and negative impacts.
## **Activity 2: Ethics Framework Mapping**
Select a familiar robot (either real or fictional) and create a visual map that identifies ethical considerations at each stage of the input-processing-output framework. Include at least two considerations per stage and explain how each consideration might impact the robot's overall ethical profile.
### Asking Essential Ethical Questions
Content providing key questions designers should ask during development.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** How might the same robot function be ethically positive in one situation but problematic in another? Consider a specific example and identify factors that might change the ethical implications of the robot's operation.

### **Check your understanding**
Which of the following is an ethical consideration at the 'input' stage of a robot's operation?
A. How the robot moves through a crowded room
B. What sensors the robot uses to collect information about people
C. How quickly the robot can complete a task
D. The material used to make the robot's exterior
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. What sensors the robot uses to collect information about people. The input stage involves how robots gather information from their environment. The types of sensors used and what information they collect about people raise important ethical concerns about privacy and consent. If you chose a different answer, remember that input refers specifically to how robots gather information, not to their physical properties or outputs.
## Key Takeaways
- Robot ethics involves considering the impact of robot design and function on people, society, and the environment
- Ethical considerations exist at every stage of the input-processing-output framework
- Evaluating robot ethics requires asking questions about benefits, potential harms, and unintended consequences

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 9.1
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 9 in the following ways:**
- It provides the foundation for all subsequent lessons by establishing what robot ethics are and why they matter
- It introduces the input-processing-output framework that will be used throughout the module
- It sets up the ethical evaluation criteria that students will apply to safety, privacy, societal impact, and design considerations in later lessons
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Sorting Game: Ethical Dilemma Cards - Students are given cards with robot scenarios and must sort them into categories based on their ethical implications, then explain their reasoning to the class. For example, students might receive cards describing robots used in healthcare, surveillance, or warfare contexts, and must categorize them as "ethically straightforward," "ethically problematic," or "ethically complex" and defend their classifications.
