[start of lesson]
# [h1] [must be 1st] 2.5
# [h1] [must be 2nd] Robot Construction and Materials
## [h2] [must be 3rd] Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Compare different materials used in robot construction and their properties
- Explain how robot design is influenced by intended task and environment
- Evaluate the ethical implications of material choices in robotics
### [h2] [must be 4th] Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Ethics of Material Selection in Robotics
A discussion exploring how material choices in robotics impact environmental sustainability, resource usage, and end-of-life considerations.
## [h2] Robot Body Design
Discussion of how robot physical structure is determined by its intended function and operating environment.
### [h3] Form Following Function
Exploration of how a robot's purpose dictates its physical design and structural requirements.
### [h3] Size and Shape Considerations
Analysis of factors that influence robot dimensionality and form factor decisions.
### [h3] Design for Different Environments
Examination of how environmental conditions necessitate specific design adaptations.
## [h2] **Activity 1: Material Properties Lab**
Explore and test properties of different materials (flexibility, strength, weight, conductivity) using simple household items or online simulations. Create a comparison chart documenting your findings and discuss how each material might be advantageous in specific robot applications. Consider which properties would be most important for robots operating in different contexts.
## [h2] Materials in Robotics
Overview of common materials used in robot construction and their characteristic properties.
### [h3] Metals and Alloys
Description of metallic materials, their properties, and typical applications in robotics.
### [h3] Plastics and Polymers
Explanation of polymer-based materials and their growing importance in modern robotics.
### [h3] Specialized and Composite Materials
Introduction to advanced materials designed for specific robotic applications and performance requirements.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot designed to work in an extreme environment like underwater or in space. How would the materials differ from a household robot, and why? Think about the specific environmental challenges these robots would face and how material selection addresses those challenges.

## [h2] Material Selection Factors
Analysis of the key considerations when choosing materials for robot construction.
### [h3] Strength and Weight Considerations
Exploration of the often competing needs for structural integrity and mobility.
### [h3] Durability and Maintenance
Discussion of longevity factors and how material choices affect robot lifespan and maintenance requirements.
### [h3] Cost and Availability
Overview of economic factors in material selection and supply chain considerations.
## [h2] **Activity 2: Environment-Specific Design**
Design a conceptual robot body for a challenging environment such as underwater exploration, space maintenance, or volcanic monitoring. Create a sketch or diagram of your robot design, indicating which materials you would use for different components and why. Justify your material selections based on the environmental challenges your robot will face.
## [h2] Ethical and Sustainable Design
Examination of how material choices impact environmental footprint and ethical considerations.
### [h3] Environmental Impact of Materials
Discussion of resource usage, extraction practices, and manufacturing impacts.
### [h3] Recyclability and Waste
Analysis of end-of-life considerations for robotic systems and materials.
### [h3] Sustainable Robotics Practices
Overview of emerging practices to reduce environmental impact in robot design and production.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** How might the materials used in robots impact the environment when the robot reaches the end of its useful life? Consider the challenges of recycling complex devices and the potential for designing robots with a circular economy approach.

### **[h3] Check your understanding**
Which material consideration is MOST important when designing a robot for search and rescue operations in disaster zones?
A. Using only biodegradable materials to prevent environmental contamination
B. Selecting lightweight but durable materials that can withstand harsh conditions
C. Choosing the most inexpensive materials to reduce production costs
D. Using only transparent materials so the robot's internal components are visible
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. Selecting lightweight but durable materials that can withstand harsh conditions. In search and rescue operations, robots must navigate challenging environments with debris, unstable structures, and varying conditions. Lightweight materials help with mobility and deployment, while durability ensures the robot can withstand impacts, dust, moisture, and other harsh conditions without failing during critical missions. If you chose a different answer, remember that while environmental impact, cost, and visibility may be considerations, the primary requirement is functionality in harsh conditions to successfully complete life-saving missions.
## [h2] Key Takeaways
- The physical design and materials of a robot directly impact its functionality, durability, and suitability for specific environments
- Material selection involves balancing multiple factors including strength, weight, flexibility, cost, and environmental impact
- Responsible robot design considers both performance requirements and ethical implications of material choices

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 2.5
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 2 in the following ways:**
- It builds on the understanding of robot systems by examining the physical construction that houses and supports all the input, processing, and output components
- It connects the abstract concept of robot functionality to the concrete realities of physical design and material constraints
- It introduces ethical considerations in robotics from a materials perspective, preparing students for deeper ethical discussions in later modules

**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Matching game: Material Matchmaker - Players must pair robot applications with the most appropriate construction materials. For example, matching an underwater exploration robot with waterproof and corrosion-resistant materials, or a space robot with lightweight and radiation-resistant materials. This tests students' understanding of how material properties align with specific robotic requirements and environments.
