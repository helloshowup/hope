# Wheels and Legs: Common Robot Movement Methods
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Compare and contrast at least three different wheel arrangements and their applications
- Explain the advantages and challenges of legged robot designs
- Determine the most appropriate movement method (wheels or legs) for specific robot tasks and environments
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Comparing Wheeled and Legged Robot Designs
A discussion examining the strengths and limitations of wheeled versus legged robot designs and how to make informed decisions between them for various applications.
## Wheeled Robot Designs
This section explores the most common wheeled configurations used in robotics and their specific applications.
### Two-Wheel Configurations
Overview of differential drive systems, self-balancing designs, and their applications in simple robots.
### Four-Wheel and Track Designs
Explanation of standard car-like arrangements, skid steering, and tracked designs for improved traction.
### Omnidirectional Wheels
Description of special wheel designs that allow for movement in any direction without traditional turning.
## **Activity 1: Wheel Arrangement Testing**
Using materials available to you (toy wheels, cardboard, etc.), create simple models of two different wheel arrangements discussed in this lesson. Test how each arrangement handles turning, moving forward, and traversing a small obstacle. Record your observations about stability and maneuverability differences between the arrangements.
## Legged Robot Designs
This section examines how robots use leg-based locomotion to navigate environments.
### Bipedal (Two-Legged) Robots
Overview of humanoid-style robots that walk on two legs, including balance challenges and design approaches.
### Quadrupedal and Hexapod Robots
Explanation of four and six-legged designs that mimic animal locomotion for improved stability and versatility.
### Balance and Stability Challenges
Discussion of the complexities involved in maintaining balance with legged locomotion and control systems.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the environment you're in right now. Would a wheeled or legged robot be better suited to navigate this space? Why? Consider factors like flooring type, obstacles, and inclines that might influence your decision.
## Comparing Wheels and Legs
This section contrasts the two movement approaches across key performance metrics.
### Efficiency and Energy Use
Analysis of the energy requirements for both locomotion methods and their relative efficiency.
### Terrain Navigation Abilities
Comparison of how each method handles different terrain challenges like stairs, rough ground, and gaps.
### Speed vs. Versatility
Discussion of the tradeoffs between maximum speed capability and adaptability to various environments.
## **Activity 2: Movement Method Decision Matrix**
Create a simple decision matrix with environmental factors (smooth surfaces, stairs, rough terrain, etc.) listed in rows and movement methods (two wheels, four wheels, tracks, two legs, six legs) in columns. Rate each combination from 1-5 based on effectiveness. Use this matrix to determine the optimal movement method for three different scenarios: an office delivery robot, a search and rescue robot, and a planetary exploration rover.
## Choosing the Right Movement Method
This section provides a framework for selecting the optimal movement approach for specific robot applications.
### Task Requirements Analysis
Guidelines for identifying how mission objectives influence movement design choices.
### Environmental Considerations
Assessment of how the operating environment impacts the decision between wheels and legs.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider why most human-made vehicles use wheels, while most animals use legs. What advantages does each approach offer? Reflect on how evolution has shaped animal locomotion versus how engineering principles have guided vehicle design.
### **Check your understanding**
A robot needs to climb stairs and navigate rough terrain. Which movement design would be MOST appropriate?
A. Two wheels with a gyroscope for balance
B. Four wheels in a standard car arrangement
C. Six legs with distributed weight
D. Tank treads on a flat platform
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. Six legs with distributed weight. Six-legged (hexapod) designs provide excellent stability and can navigate uneven terrain including stairs. They can keep multiple legs on the ground while others move, allowing for secure climbing capabilities that wheeled designs typically cannot match. If you chose a different answer, consider that while wheeled and track designs work well on flat or moderately uneven surfaces, they typically struggle with discontinuous terrain like stairs.
## Key Takeaways
- Wheeled robots typically offer speed, efficiency, and simplicity but may struggle with uneven terrain
- Legged robots provide greater versatility for navigating complex environments but require more complex balance and control mechanisms
- The choice between wheels and legs depends on specific task requirements, environmental conditions, and design constraints

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 3.2
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 3 in the following ways:**
- Builds on the introduction to robot movement by exploring the two most common movement methods in detail
- Provides the foundation for understanding more specialized movement approaches in the next lesson
- Helps students develop critical decision-making skills for selecting appropriate mobility systems
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Design Challenge: Obstacle Course Designer where students create a challenging course, then determine whether a wheeled or legged robot design would be better suited to navigate it, justifying their choices. For example, students might create a course with stairs, gravel, narrow passages, and small gaps, then analyze which parts favor legged robots versus which parts favor wheeled designs.
