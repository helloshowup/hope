# From Sensing to Action
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Trace the path of information from sensor input to robot action
- Create simple flowcharts showing sensor-driven decision-making
- Identify potential problems when sensors don't function correctly
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Information Pathway in Robotics
This podcast explores how information flows from sensor inputs through processing systems to trigger meaningful robot actions.
## The Information Pathway
This section explores how environmental data travels through a robot system from initial detection to eventual response.
### Sensor Input Collection
Overview of how different sensors gather raw environmental data and convert physical phenomena into electrical signals.
### Data Processing and Interpretation
Explanation of how robots filter, interpret and make sense of raw sensor data to create meaningful information.
### Triggering Robot Responses
Description of how processed sensor information gets translated into specific robot actions and behaviors.
## **Activity 1: Sensor-Decision Flowcharts**
Create a simple flowchart showing how robots make decisions based on different sensor inputs, such as "If light sensor detects darkness, then turn on headlight." Add at least one additional decision branch showing what happens if the sensor detects bright light instead. Your flowchart should include the sensor input, decision point, and resulting robot actions.
## Decision-Making Based on Sensor Data
This section covers how robots use logical frameworks to make decisions based on sensor information.
### Simple If-Then Logic
Explanation of basic conditional statements that form the foundation of sensor-based robot decision-making.
### Combining Multiple Sensor Inputs
Methods for processing and responding to data from multiple sensors simultaneously.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when one of your senses gave you incorrect information, such as an optical illusion or misheard sound. How might similar sensory misinterpretations affect a robot's ability to function correctly in its environment?

### Prioritizing Conflicting Sensor Information
Strategies for resolving contradictions when different sensors provide incompatible information.
## Troubleshooting Sensor Systems
This section examines common sensor problems and approaches to diagnosing and fixing them.
### Common Sensor Failures
Overview of typical sensor malfunctions and their effects on robot performance.
### Calibration and Reliability Issues
How improper calibration affects sensor accuracy and methods for improving reliability.
## **Activity 2: Sensor Troubleshooting Scenarios**
Analyze this scenario: A line-following robot consistently veers off its path despite having properly functioning motors. Identify which sensor might be malfunctioning and explain why. Then describe what tests you would perform to confirm your diagnosis and how you would fix the issue.
### Testing and Verification Methods
Techniques for confirming sensor functionality and accuracy in different operating conditions.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot trying to navigate a maze. What sequence of sensor inputs and actions would help it find the exit? Think about how the robot would need to prioritize different types of sensor information to make effective navigation decisions.

### **Check your understanding**
If a robot with a distance sensor keeps bumping into walls, what is the most likely problem?
A. The distance sensor is properly functioning but set to the wrong distance threshold
B. The robot's wheels are turning too quickly for the sensor to react
C. The distance sensor is malfunctioning or not properly connected to the processing unit
D. The walls are made of a material that is invisible to the sensor
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. The distance sensor is malfunctioning or not properly connected to the processing unit. If a robot with a distance sensor continues to bump into walls, the most likely issue is that the sensor itself is malfunctioning or the connection between the sensor and the processing unit is faulty, preventing the robot from receiving accurate distance information. If you chose a different answer, remember that while threshold settings and speed can be factors, the complete failure to detect walls usually indicates a hardware or connection problem.
## Key Takeaways
- Sensor information follows a pathway from environmental input through processing to robot action.
- Robot decision-making relies on properly interpreting sensor data using logical rules.
- Troubleshooting sensor issues requires understanding both the sensor technology and the information pathway.

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 4.4
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 4 in the following ways:**
- It builds upon previous understanding of individual sensors to show how they contribute to robot behavior
- It bridges the gap between sensing hardware and the programming concepts that will be covered in later modules
- It prepares students for understanding the relationship between inputs and outputs in robotic systems
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Role Play: Human Robot - One student acts as a 'robot' following simple sensor-based instructions from a 'programmer' student. The robot must respond to simulated sensor inputs (colored cards representing different sensor readings) with specific actions. For example, when shown a red card (representing a proximity alert), the "robot" must stop and change direction, while a green card might indicate clear path ahead, prompting the robot to move forward.
