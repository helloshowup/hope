# Alternative Movement Methods
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify at least four alternative methods of robot movement beyond wheels and legs
- Match appropriate movement methods to specific environments and tasks
- Discuss ethical considerations related to robots moving in public spaces
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Specialized Robot Movement for Challenging Environments
A discussion exploring how engineers match robot movement methods to specific environmental challenges and the innovations driving new mobility solutions.
## Aerial Robot Movement
This section explores how robots navigate through air, including the engineering principles behind different flight methods.
### Propeller-Based Flight
An examination of propeller systems used in drones, quadcopters, and other aerial robots, including control mechanisms and power considerations.
### Fixed and Flapping Wing Designs
Analysis of robot designs that mimic traditional aircraft and natural flyers like birds and insects, highlighting their advantages in specific applications.
## **Activity 1: Environment-Movement Matching Challenge**
Examine the following environmental scenarios and select which movement method would be most appropriate for each. For a robot exploring a dense rainforest canopy, would you choose propeller-based flight, fixed-wing design, or something else? Justify your selection based on the environment's constraints and the robot's objectives.
## Aquatic Robot Movement
This section covers how robots move through water environments, from surface to deep underwater applications.
### Surface Swimming Robots
Overview of designs that allow robots to navigate on water surfaces, including boat-like structures and surface tension exploiters.
### Underwater Propulsion Methods
Exploration of propellers, jet propulsion, and biomimetic swimming methods used for underwater robot mobility.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** How might flying robots change our world in the next ten years? What benefits and challenges might they bring?

## Specialized Movement Methods
This section examines unique movement approaches that solve specific mobility challenges.
### Jumping and Hopping Mechanisms
Analysis of spring-loaded and pneumatic jumping systems that enable robots to overcome obstacles or navigate rough terrain.
### Snake-like and Inchworm Movement
Overview of articulated and flexible robots that can navigate confined spaces through undulating movement patterns.
### Rolling and Tumbling Designs
Exploration of spherical and transformable robots that can roll or tumble across terrain for efficient movement.
## Ethical Considerations for Moving Robots
This section addresses important concerns when deploying mobile robots in spaces shared with humans and other organisms.
### Privacy Concerns
Discussion of surveillance implications of mobile robots, especially aerial platforms, and potential safeguards.
### Safety in Shared Spaces
Analysis of collision avoidance, predictable movement patterns, and human-robot interaction in public environments.
### Noise and Environmental Impact
Examination of how robot movement can disrupt natural environments through noise, physical presence, or ecological interference.
## **Activity 2: Robot Movement Ethics Discussion**
Consider the scenario of autonomous delivery drones flying through residential neighborhoods. In small groups, identify three key ethical concerns these robots might raise. How might these concerns be addressed through design, regulation, or community engagement? Prepare to share your group's conclusions.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot swimming in a coral reef. What ethical concerns should engineers address when designing its movement system?

### **Check your understanding**
Which movement method would be MOST appropriate for a robot designed to inspect narrow vertical pipes in a building's plumbing system?
A. Quadcopter drone flight
B. Snake-like slithering movement
C. Six-legged climbing
D. Wheeled tank tread design
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. Snake-like slithering movement. Snake-like slithering movement is ideal for narrow pipes as it allows the robot to move through confined spaces, navigate bends, and maintain contact with the pipe surface. The narrow, flexible design mimics how real snakes navigate similar confined spaces. If you chose a different answer, consider how the movement method would handle tight spaces and turns within a pipe environment.
## Key Takeaways
- Robot movement methods should be matched to the specific environment and task requirements
- Nature has inspired many specialized robot movement designs for challenging environments
- Ethical considerations are essential when designing robots that move in spaces shared with humans and other living beings

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 3.3
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 3 in the following ways:**
- Expands beyond common movement methods to explore specialized approaches for diverse environments
- Builds on previous lessons about robot mobility by introducing alternative methods beyond wheels and legs
- Introduces ethical considerations that connect to broader robotics applications across the curriculum
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Role-Playing Scenario: Robot Designer Pitch where student teams are given challenging environments (deep sea, forest canopy, Mars surface) and must pitch their robot movement design to a panel of 'investors', explaining their movement method choice, design innovations, and how they've addressed environmental and ethical concerns.
