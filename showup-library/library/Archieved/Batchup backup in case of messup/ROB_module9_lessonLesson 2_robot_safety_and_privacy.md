[start of lesson]
# [h1] [must be 1st] 9.2
# [h1] [must be 2nd] Robot Safety and Privacy
## [h2] [must be 3rd] Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify essential safety features required in different types of robots
- Analyze how robots collect and use data, and the resulting privacy implications
- Evaluate the trade-offs between robot functionality and user privacy/safety
### [h2] [must be 4th] Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Privacy Implications of Robot Data Collection
This podcast explores how different types of robots collect, store, and use personal data, and the resulting privacy concerns that arise for users and society.
## [h2] Physical Safety in Robot Design
This section examines the critical safety features and protocols required in robotic design to prevent harm to users and bystanders.
### [h3] Essential Safety Features and Mechanisms
Exploration of collision detection, emergency stops, motion limitations, and other safety features essential for different robot types.
### [h3] Safety Standards and Testing Procedures
Overview of industry standards, certification requirements, and testing methodologies to ensure robots meet safety guidelines.
### [h3] Emergency Protocols and Fail-Safes
Discussion of redundant systems, emergency shutdown procedures, and fail-safe mechanisms that prevent accidents or minimize harm.
## [h2] **Activity 1: Safety Feature Design Challenge**
Design three essential safety features for a robot intended for classroom use with elementary school students. Create a simple sketch or diagram of each feature and explain how it works, why it's necessary, and how it would prevent potential accidents or injuries. Consider mechanical, electrical, and software safety elements in your design.
## [h2] Robot Sensors and Data Collection
This section examines the various ways robots gather information from their environment and the privacy considerations that arise.
### [h3] Types of Data Robots Collect
Overview of visual, audio, location, interaction, and environmental data collected by different robot sensors.
### [h3] Data Storage, Processing, and Usage
Explanation of how robot systems manage collected data, including local vs. cloud storage, processing methods, and data usage purposes.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the last time you interacted with a smart device (like a voice assistant or robot vacuum). What data might it have collected about you and your environment? How comfortable are you with this collection, and why?

### [h3] Privacy Vulnerabilities and Protections
Analysis of potential security weaknesses, data breach risks, and technological and policy approaches to protect user privacy.
## [h2] Balancing Functionality with Privacy and Safety
This section explores the challenge of creating effective robots while respecting ethical boundaries around safety and privacy.
### [h3] Identifying Necessary vs. Optional Features
Framework for determining which robot capabilities are essential for functionality versus those that create unnecessary risk.
### [h3] Privacy-by-Design Principles
Discussion of how to incorporate privacy considerations from the earliest stages of robot development rather than as an afterthought.
## [h2] **Activity 2: Privacy Impact Assessment**
Create a simple privacy impact assessment chart for a household robot assistant. List at least five types of data the robot might collect, explain why this data is necessary for its function, and identify one privacy concern for each data type. Finally, propose one mitigation strategy for each concern that balances functionality with privacy protection.
### [h3] Communicating Safety and Privacy to Users
Methods for clearly explaining to users what data robots collect, how it's used, and what safety measures are in place.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** What safety features would you prioritize in a robot designed to interact with elderly individuals or young children? Consider both physical safety mechanisms and privacy protections in your reflection.

### **[h3] Check your understanding**
A company is designing a robot that will help elderly people in their homes. Which of the following features raises the most significant privacy concerns?
A. The robot can detect if a person has fallen
B. The robot constantly records video in all rooms to monitor for emergencies
C. The robot can measure room temperature
D. The robot can lift and carry objects
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. The robot constantly records video in all rooms to monitor for emergencies. While detecting falls is important for safety, constant video recording in all rooms is a significant privacy invasion. The company should consider less invasive alternatives like motion sensors or wearable fall detection devices that preserve privacy while maintaining safety. If you chose a different answer, consider how each feature impacts the balance between utility and privacy, and which ones could be redesigned to be less intrusive.
## [h2] Key Takeaways
- Physical safety features are essential in robot design and should prevent harm to users and bystanders
- Robots collect various types of data through sensors, raising important privacy considerations
- Good robot design balances functionality with appropriate safety measures and privacy protections

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 9.2
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 9 in the following ways:**
- This lesson builds on the ethical foundation from Lesson 1 by focusing specifically on safety and privacy considerations
- It addresses two key practical applications of ethics in robotics: physical safety and data privacy
- It supports the module's overall goal of helping students understand the responsible design and use of robotic technology
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Role Play - Safety Inspector Challenge: Students review images or descriptions of robot designs and identify potential safety issues, then propose solutions to address each concern. For example, students might examine a robot kitchen assistant design and identify hazards like sharp appendages, hot surface contact risks, or privacy concerns from cameras, then recommend design modifications like rounded edges, heat shields, or limited camera field-of-view options.
