# Understanding the Engineering Design Process
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Explain the five steps of the engineering design process and their purpose in robotics
- Distinguish between systematic design approaches and trial-and-error methods
- Connect the design process to the input-processing-output framework previously learned
## Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Engineering Design Process in Modern Robotics
This podcast will explore how the systematic engineering design process has led to breakthroughs in robotics and why structured approaches produce better results than trial-and-error methods.
## Introduction to Engineering Design
This section introduces the concept of engineering design as a structured approach to solving problems in robotics.
### What is Engineering Design?
Overview of engineering design as a systematic approach to solving problems and creating solutions.
### Why a Systematic Approach Matters
Explanation of the benefits of using a methodical design process rather than unstructured approaches.
### Engineering Design in Robotics
Discussion of how the engineering design process applies specifically to robotics challenges.
## **Activity 1: Design Process Mapping**
Create a visual flow chart of the engineering design process with specific robotics examples for each step. Draw connections between each step, identifying key questions that should be asked at each phase and potential robotics applications that demonstrate that step in action.
## The Five-Step Engineering Design Process
This section explores each step of the engineering design process in detail.
### Define the Problem
Description of how to clearly articulate the problem to be solved.
### Research and Ideate
Explanation of gathering information and brainstorming potential solutions.
### Design Solutions
Overview of creating detailed plans based on the most promising ideas.
### Build and Test
Description of constructing prototypes and evaluating their performance.
### Improve and Iterate
Explanation of refining designs based on test results.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time you solved a problem by trial-and-error. How might using the engineering design process have changed your approach? Consider what specific steps might have made your solution more effective or efficient.

## Design Process vs. Trial-and-Error
This section compares structured design approaches with less formal methods.
### Limitations of Trial-and-Error
Discussion of the drawbacks of unstructured problem-solving approaches.
### Benefits of Systematic Design
Explanation of how a structured process improves outcomes.
### When Each Approach Is Appropriate
Analysis of contexts where different approaches might be suitable.
## **Activity 2: Robot Case Study Analysis**
Analyze the design process behind a well-known robot (e.g., Mars Rover, Roomba) using provided resources. Identify how each of the five engineering design steps was implemented in the development of this robot and what challenges were addressed during each phase.
## Connecting to Input-Processing-Output
This section links the design process to the input-processing-output framework.
### Inputs in the Design Process
Explanation of how inputs are considered when designing robot systems.
### Processing in the Design Process
Description of how processing elements are incorporated into designs.
### Outputs in the Design Process
Discussion of how outputs are planned and evaluated.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how the input-processing-output framework aligns with the steps of the design process. Where do you see connections? Identify which steps of the design process focus most heavily on inputs, processing, and outputs.

### **Check your understanding**
Which of the following best describes the relationship between the engineering design process and the input-processing-output framework?
A. They are completely separate approaches that cannot be used together
B. The engineering design process replaces the need for the input-processing-output framework
C. The input-processing-output framework helps organize the components selected during the design process
D. The engineering design process only applies to the programming aspects of robotics

Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. The input-processing-output framework helps organize the components selected during the design process. The engineering design process provides the overall methodology for solving problems, while the input-processing-output framework helps specifically with organizing how a robot will gather information (inputs), process that information, and respond (outputs) when designing robot solutions. If you chose a different answer, remember that these frameworks complement each other rather than competing or replacing one another.
## Key Takeaways
- The engineering design process is a systematic approach with five key steps: define, research, design, build/test, and improve
- Systematic design approaches provide better results than trial-and-error by considering multiple solutions and testing thoroughly
- The input-processing-output framework integrates with the design process, particularly when selecting components and planning functionality

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 7.1
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 7 in the following ways:**
- This lesson establishes the foundational framework that students will apply throughout the module
- It provides the systematic approach they'll use in subsequent lessons to define problems, research solutions, design robots, test their designs, and engage in challenges
- It connects previous learning (input-processing-output) to the new design framework students will use

**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Sequencing Game: Design Process Sequence Challenge - A card-sorting game where students arrange steps of famous robot design projects in the correct order according to the engineering design process. Example: Sort cards showing the development stages of the Mars Rover from initial problem definition to final deployment.
