# Defining Problems and Researching Solutions
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Create clear problem statements using structured templates
- Apply research and brainstorming techniques to generate multiple solution ideas
- Evaluate potential solutions against constraints and criteria
## Lesson Podcast Discussion: Crafting Effective Problem Statements
A discussion on how well-defined problem statements lead to better robotics solutions, featuring examples of good vs. poor problem definitions and their impact on the design process.
## Defining the Problem
This section introduces the importance of clearly defining problems before attempting to solve them in robotics design.
### Elements of a Strong Problem Statement
Learn the key components that make up an effective problem statement, including clear articulation of the issue, scope definition, and success criteria.
### Identifying Stakeholders and Needs
Explore methods for identifying who is affected by the problem and determining their specific needs and requirements.
### Setting Constraints and Requirements
Understand how to establish the limitations and specific requirements that any solution must work within.
## **Activity 1: Problem Definition Workshop**
Practice writing problem statements for given robotics scenarios using a structured template. For each scenario, identify the affected stakeholders, list the constraints, and define success criteria. Complete at least two scenario exercises to build your problem definition skills.
## Problem Analysis Techniques
This section covers methods for analyzing problems in depth to better understand their nature and potential solutions.
### Root Cause Analysis
Learn techniques like the "5 Whys" and fishbone diagrams to identify the underlying causes of observed problems.
### Needs Assessment
Explore structured approaches to evaluate and prioritize the needs that must be addressed by your solution.
### Constraint Mapping
Understand how to visually map the constraints affecting your problem to better understand the solution space.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a problem you've encountered recently. How would you frame it as a clear problem statement using what you've learned? Try writing it down using the template discussed in class.

## Research Methods for Robotics Solutions
This section explores various approaches to researching potential solutions for robotics problems.
### Finding Existing Solutions
Learn how to research and analyze existing solutions to similar problems in the robotics field.
### Expert Consultation
Understand when and how to consult with subject matter experts to gain insights into potential solutions.
### Literature and Resource Review
Explore methods for conducting effective literature reviews to inform your solution design process.
## Brainstorming and Ideation
This section introduces techniques for generating multiple solution ideas through structured creativity.
### Structured Brainstorming Techniques
Learn methods like mind mapping, SCAMPER, and rapid ideation to generate diverse solution ideas.
### Creative Thinking Methods
Explore techniques that promote divergent thinking and help overcome mental blocks in the ideation process.
### Collaborative Ideation
Understand approaches for effective group brainstorming and idea sharing in robotics design teams.
## **Activity 2: Solution Matrix Creation**
Develop a decision matrix for a robotics problem scenario. Identify at least three potential solutions and evaluate them against 4-5 specific criteria with weighted importance. Calculate final scores and determine which solution rates highest according to your analysis.
## Evaluating Potential Solutions
This section covers methodical approaches to evaluating and selecting from potential solutions.
### Developing Evaluation Criteria
Learn how to create specific, measurable criteria for assessing potential robotics solutions.
### Using Decision Matrices
Understand how to construct and use weighted decision matrices to objectively compare multiple solution options.
### Ethical Considerations in Solution Evaluation
Explore the ethical dimensions that should be considered when evaluating robotics solutions.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how different stakeholders might view the same robotics problem differently. How might this affect your solution design? Think about a specific example where different perspectives could lead to different solution priorities.

### **Check your understanding**
Which of the following is NOT typically included in a well-defined problem statement?
A. A description of who is affected by the problem
B. The specific constraints or limitations that must be considered
C. A detailed technical solution to the problem
D. A clear articulation of what success would look like
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. A detailed technical solution to the problem. A problem statement should clearly define the issue without jumping to solutions. It should identify who is affected, what constraints exist, and what success looks like, but should not prescribe a specific solutionâ€”that comes later in the design process after research and ideation. If you chose a different answer, remember that problem definition and solution design are separate phases of the engineering process.
## Key Takeaways
- A well-defined problem statement clearly identifies what needs to be solved, who is affected, and what constraints exist
- Research and brainstorming should generate multiple possible solutions before selecting one to develop
- Solutions should be evaluated systematically against specific criteria, including technical feasibility, resource requirements, and ethical considerations

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 7.2
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 7 in the following ways:**
- It builds on the introduction to the design process by diving deeper into the first two critical steps
- It prepares students for the next lesson on designing robot solutions by ensuring they have properly defined problems and researched potential approaches
- It provides essential problem definition and research skills needed for the module's focus on the engineering design process
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Scenario-based Problem Solving: Problem Detective - A game where students are presented with poorly written problem statements and must identify what's missing or problematic, then rewrite them correctly. Example: Transform "We need a robot" into "Design a robot that can safely navigate a crowded school hallway to deliver items between classrooms while operating without human supervision."
