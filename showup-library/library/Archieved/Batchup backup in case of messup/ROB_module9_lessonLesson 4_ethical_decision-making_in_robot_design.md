[start of lesson]
# [h1] [must be 1st] 9.4
# [h1] [must be 2nd] Ethical Decision-Making in Robot Design
## [h2] [must be 3rd] Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Apply simple ethical frameworks to evaluate robot design decisions
- Identify different stakeholders affected by robot implementation
- Design robot features that accommodate users with diverse needs and abilities
### [h2] [must be 4th] Lesson Podcast Discussion: Stakeholder Perspectives in Robotics
This podcast explores the various stakeholders impacted by robot implementation and how to balance their potentially conflicting interests.
## [h2] Ethical Frameworks for Decision-Making
This section introduces simple ethical frameworks that can help guide decisions when designing robots.
### [h3] Balancing Benefits and Harms
Content on how to assess potential positive and negative impacts of robot design choices.
### [h3] Considering Rights and Fairness
Content about ensuring robot designs respect individual rights and promote equitable outcomes.
### [h3] Thinking About Consequences
Content exploring how to anticipate the short and long-term effects of robot design decisions.
## [h2] **Activity 1: Stakeholder Analysis Workshop**
Identify all people affected by a specific robot scenario. Create a chart listing each stakeholder (e.g., users, businesses, maintenance staff, bystanders) and how their needs might differ or conflict. Consider how you would prioritize these different needs when finalizing your design decisions.
## [h2] Stakeholder Analysis in Robot Design
This section covers methods for identifying and addressing the needs of different groups affected by robots.
### [h3] Identifying Who Is Affected
Content about systematically identifying all potential stakeholders in robot implementation.
### [h3] Understanding Different Needs
Content exploring how various stakeholders may have different priorities and requirements.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a robot designed for use in schools. Who are all the different people who might interact with or be affected by this robot? Consider how the needs of students, teachers, administrators, custodial staff, and parents might differ.

### [h3] Resolving Conflicting Interests
Content about strategies for balancing competing stakeholder priorities in robot design.
## [h2] Inclusive and Accessible Design
This section focuses on designing robots that can be used by people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
### [h3] Designing for Different Abilities
Content about creating robots that accommodate users with various physical and cognitive abilities.
### [h3] Cultural and Social Inclusivity
Content exploring how robot design can accommodate different cultural backgrounds and social contexts.
### [h3] Testing with Diverse Users
Content about the importance of involving diverse user groups in the testing and refinement process.
## [h2] **Activity 2: Inclusive Design Challenge**
Select an existing robot design (e.g., a customer service robot or educational robot) and modify it to make it more accessible for users with a specific disability. Consider what features you would add or change to ensure the robot could be effectively used by someone with a visual, hearing, or mobility impairment.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Have you ever encountered a technology that was difficult for you to use? Reflect on how it could have been better designed to meet your needs and consider how this experience might inform your approach to inclusive robot design.

### **[h3] Check your understanding**
When designing a robot for a public library, which approach best demonstrates ethical decision-making?
A. Designing the robot to be as technologically advanced as possible
B. Making the robot look exactly like a human librarian
C. Ensuring the robot can complete tasks as quickly as possible
D. Considering the needs of users with different abilities, ages, and technological comfort levels
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is D. Considering the needs of users with different abilities, ages, and technological comfort levels. Ethical decision-making in robot design involves considering the diverse needs of all potential users. A library serves people of varying ages, abilities, and comfort with technology, so the robot should be designed to be accessible and usable by everyone who might encounter it. If you chose a different answer, remember that technological advancement, human-like appearance, or speed are not necessarily ethical priorities if they don't serve the needs of diverse users.
## [h2] Key Takeaways
- Ethical frameworks provide structured approaches to making design decisions about robots
- Robot design affects multiple stakeholders whose needs and interests should be considered
- Inclusive design ensures robots are accessible and useful to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds
[End of Lesson]
## Instructional designer notes of lesson 9.4
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 9 in the following ways:**
- It provides practical tools for applying ethical principles to the robot design process
- It builds on theoretical foundations from earlier lessons in the ethics module
- It prepares students for the synthesis of ethical concepts in Lesson 5
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Design Dilemma Cards: Players are presented with robot design scenarios containing ethical challenges and must collaborate to develop solutions that address the needs of all stakeholders. For example, students might receive a card describing a delivery robot that must navigate crowded sidewalks, and they must identify the stakeholders affected and propose design features that balance efficiency, safety, and accessibility.
