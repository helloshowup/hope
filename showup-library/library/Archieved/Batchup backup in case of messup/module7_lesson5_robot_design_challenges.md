# [h1] [must be 1st] 7.5
# [h1] [must be 2nd] Robot Design Challenges
## [h2] [must be 3rd] Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Apply the complete engineering design process to solve a specific robot challenge
- Document each step of the design process using appropriate templates and evidence
- Evaluate the effectiveness of robot solutions against original problem statements and requirements
### [h2] [must be 4th] Lesson Podcast Discussion: Applying the Engineering Design Process to Robotics Challenges
This podcast explores how the engineering design process provides a structured framework for approaching complex robot challenges, from initial problem definition to final solution evaluation.
## [h2] Challenge Selection and Analysis
This section introduces various robot design challenges students can choose from to apply the engineering design process.
### [h3] Line-Following Challenge
Overview of line-following robot requirements, constraints, and design considerations.
### [h3] Obstacle Course Challenge
Description of obstacle course navigation challenges, including different terrains and barriers.
### [h3] Object Sorting Challenge
Explanation of object detection and sorting challenges requiring sensor integration and programming.
### [h3] Custom Challenge Design
Guidelines for students to develop their own unique robot challenge with clear requirements.
## [h2] **Activity 1: Challenge Selection and Problem Definition**
Select one of the robot challenges presented (or design your own) and develop a comprehensive problem statement. Define the specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria for your chosen challenge. Create a simple diagram illustrating the challenge environment and key elements your robot must interact with.
## [h2] Planning and Design Application
This section guides students through creating detailed plans for their robot design challenge.
### [h3] Creating Comprehensive Challenge Plans
Techniques for developing detailed design plans with component specifications and rationale.
### [h3] Setting Success Criteria
Methods for establishing measurable criteria to evaluate the success of robot designs.
### [h3] Project Management Approaches
Strategies for managing the design process, including timeline planning and resource allocation.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Reflect on how your understanding of robot design challenges has evolved since beginning this course. How has your approach to defining problems and establishing criteria changed?

## [h2] Implementation and Testing Strategies
This section covers approaches to building and testing robot designs.
### [h3] Resources and Materials Management
Strategies for identifying, sourcing, and managing resources needed for robot construction.
### [h3] Timeline Development
Techniques for creating realistic development schedules with milestones and checkpoints.
### [h3] Collaborative Testing Approaches
Methods for effective team-based testing and debugging of robot designs.
## [h2] Documentation and Presentation
This section explores how to document the design process and present solutions effectively.
### [h3] Design Portfolio Development
Guidelines for creating comprehensive portfolios that capture the entire design journey.
### [h3] Evidence Collection and Organization
Techniques for gathering and organizing evidence of design decisions and iterations.
### [h3] Presentation Techniques
Strategies for effectively communicating design processes and demonstrating solutions.
## [h2] **Activity 2: Design Portfolio Planning**
Create a template for your design portfolio that will document each phase of your robot challenge project. Include sections for the problem statement, research findings, initial designs, testing results, iterations, and final solution. Explain how you will collect evidence for each section and what format this documentation will take (sketches, photographs, video recordings, data logs, etc.).
## [h2] Reflection and Evaluation
This section covers methods for assessing design effectiveness and identifying improvements.
### [h3] Self-Assessment Methods
Approaches for critically evaluating your own design process and outcomes.
### [h3] Peer Review Processes
Structured methods for giving and receiving constructive feedback on designs.
### [h3] Future Improvement Identification
Techniques for identifying potential enhancements and next steps in the design process.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider what aspects of your final robot solution you're most proud of, and what you would change if you had more time. How might you apply what you've learned to future design challenges?

### **Check your understanding**
When evaluating the success of your robot design challenge, which of the following provides the strongest evidence of effective design?
A. The robot looks visually impressive and uses advanced components
B. The design process was completed quickly with minimal iterations
C. The robot successfully meets the specific requirements defined in the original problem statement
D. The solution is highly complex and demonstrates sophisticated programming
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. The robot successfully meets the specific requirements defined in the original problem statement. The ultimate measure of design success is whether the solution effectively addresses the original problem and meets the defined requirements. Visual appeal, development speed, and complexity may be valuable in certain contexts, but they don't necessarily indicate an effective solution if the core requirements aren't met.
## [h2] Key Takeaways
- The engineering design process provides a structured approach to solving complex robotics challenges
- Documentation throughout the design process captures important decisions and learnings
- Evaluation against original requirements is essential to determine the success of a robot design

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 7.5
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 7 in the following ways:**
- This lesson serves as a culminating experience for Module 7, allowing students to apply the complete engineering design process
- It integrates knowledge from previous lessons on robot design, programming, and testing into a comprehensive challenge
- This lesson demonstrates mastery of both the design process and the input-processing-output framework in creating effective robot solutions
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Design Competition game: Design Challenge Tournament - A competitive event where student teams apply the engineering design process to solve a surprise challenge under time constraints, with evaluation based on both process documentation and solution effectiveness. Example: Teams have three hours to design and build a robot that can navigate a mystery course revealed only at the start of the competition.
