# Biomimicry and Movement Programming
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify examples of biomimicry in robot movement design
- Compare and contrast robot movement methods with their animal inspirations
- Create a simple movement sequence using basic programming concepts
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Nature's Blueprint for Robot Movement
A discussion exploring how engineers and roboticists study and adapt animal movement patterns to create more efficient and effective robot locomotion systems.
## Understanding Biomimicry in Robotics
This section introduces students to the concept of biomimicry in robotics, explaining how engineers look to nature for solutions to complex movement challenges.
### Learning from Nature's Solutions
Overview of how animals have evolved efficient movement solutions over millions of years and how these solutions can be applied to robotics design problems.
### Benefits of Biomimetic Approaches
Discussion of the advantages of using nature-inspired designs, including efficiency, adaptability, and specialized functionality for different environments.
## **Activity 1: Animal-Robot Connection**
Match animals to robots inspired by their movement patterns, then identify what features were copied and why. Select from a provided list of animals and robot designs, then explain the biomimetic principles that connect them and the engineering advantages gained.
## Animal-Inspired Robot Designs
This section explores specific examples of how different animal movement systems have been adapted for robotics applications.
### Insect-Inspired Robots
Examination of how multi-legged insects provide inspiration for stable robot platforms that can navigate difficult terrain.
### Mammal and Reptile Movement Adaptations
Analysis of how mammalian and reptilian movement patterns have influenced robot design, from quadruped walking robots to snake-like articulated systems.
### Bird and Fish Locomotion in Robotics
Discussion of how flight and swimming mechanisms have been adapted for aerial and aquatic robots.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about an animal that moves in an interesting way. How might its movement strategy solve a robot design challenge? Consider the unique aspects of that animal's locomotion and how those principles could address specific robotic movement problems.

## Basic Movement Programming
Introduction to the programming concepts needed to control robot movement, focusing on fundamental commands and structures.
### Movement Commands and Sequences
Overview of basic movement commands for robots and how they can be sequenced to create complete movement patterns.
### Loops and Conditions in Movement
Introduction to using programming structures like loops and conditional statements to create more complex movement behaviors.
## **Activity 2: Movement Algorithm Design**
Design a basic step-by-step movement algorithm for a robot to navigate a simple obstacle course. Create a flowchart or pseudocode that includes movement commands, decision points based on potential obstacles, and repeat instructions where appropriate.
## Connecting Sensors to Movement
This section explores how sensor data can be used to create responsive robot behaviors.
### Responsive Movement Behaviors
Discussion of how robots can adjust their movements in response to environmental inputs.
### Programming Decision Trees
Introduction to creating decision-making logic that determines how a robot should move based on sensor information.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot that needs to navigate around obstacles. What decision process would it need to follow? How would you program this? Think about the sensors the robot would need and the logical steps in its decision-making process.

### **Check your understanding**
A robotics team is designing a robot to climb vertical surfaces. Which animal would provide the MOST useful biomimicry inspiration?
A. Kangaroo
B. Gecko
C. Dolphin
D. Ostrich
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. Gecko. Geckos can climb virtually any surface thanks to millions of microscopic hairs on their feet that create molecular attraction. Gecko-inspired adhesion has been successfully used in climbing robots, making them the most useful inspiration for vertical climbing capabilities. If you chose a different answer, consider why the animal's movement specialization might not be suited for vertical climbing - kangaroos excel at jumping, dolphins at swimming, and ostriches at running.
## Key Takeaways
- Biomimicry allows roboticists to adapt natural solutions that have evolved over millions of years
- Animal-inspired designs can solve complex movement challenges in robotics by mimicking nature's tested strategies
- Programming robot movement requires breaking down actions into logical sequences and decision points based on sensor inputs

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 3.5
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 3 in the following ways:**
- This final lesson connects natural movement systems to engineered ones and introduces the programming concepts that control robot movement, providing a bridge to future modules on sensors and programming
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Programming Simulation: Robot Path Planner where students create a sequence of movement commands to navigate a virtual robot through an obstacle course. For example, students could be given a grid-based environment with obstacles and a target location, then must use directional commands, loops, and conditionals to guide their robot successfully to the goal while avoiding obstacles.
