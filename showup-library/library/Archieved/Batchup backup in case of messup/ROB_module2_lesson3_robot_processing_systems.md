## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Describe the function of controllers and computers in robots
- Explain how robots use programs to process information
- Create a simple decision tree showing robot information processing
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Processing Information in Robotic Systems
This podcast explores how robots process information from inputs to make decisions, comparing different processing architectures and their capabilities.
## The Robot Brain
This section introduces the central processing components that serve as a robot's "brain," explaining the hardware that enables robots to process information and make decisions.
### Microcontrollers vs. Computers
Examines the differences between simpler microcontrollers and full computers in robotics, including capabilities, power requirements, and appropriate applications.
### Processing Components and Architecture
Explores the key hardware components of robot processing systems and how they're arranged to handle information efficiently.
### Memory and Storage in Robots
Discusses how robots store information, both temporarily in working memory and long-term in storage, and how this affects robot performance.
## **Activity 1: Processing Power Comparison**
Compare three different types of controllers (basic microcontroller, mid-range processor, advanced computer) and identify which would be most appropriate for specific robot applications. For each controller, consider processing speed, memory capacity, and power requirements, then match it to either a factory line robot, household robot vacuum, or autonomous research vehicle.
## How Robots Process Information
This section covers the logical flow of information through a robot system, from receiving input signals to determining appropriate actions.
### From Inputs to Decisions
Explains how robots convert sensor data into usable information and the steps involved in processing this data.
### Programming and Algorithms
Discusses the role of programming in creating rules for robots to follow and how algorithms structure robot decision-making.
### Simple vs. Complex Processing
Compares basic programmed responses with more sophisticated processing techniques, including machine learning approaches.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about how your brain processes information compared to a robot. What are the similarities and differences in how you make decisions versus how a robot would be programmed to decide?

## Decision-Making in Robots
This section explores how robots use logic to make decisions based on processed information and the varying levels of sophistication in robot decision-making.
### Logic Patterns and Decision Trees
Introduces common logical structures used in robot programming and how decision trees guide robot behavior.
### Real-Time Processing Challenges
Discusses the difficulties robots face when needing to process information quickly in changing environments.
### Intelligence Levels in Robot Processing
Examines the spectrum from simple preprogrammed responses to advanced AI systems in robots.
## **Activity 2: Decision Tree Design**
Create a simple flowchart showing how a robot would make decisions when navigating a maze. Your decision tree should include at least three decision points where the robot must choose between multiple actions based on sensor inputs. Include conditions like "if path blocked on left" and resulting actions like "turn right." Draw this on paper or use an online flowchart tool.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how a robot's processing needs might change depending on whether it works in a controlled factory environment versus an unpredictable outdoor setting. What additional processing capabilities would be necessary for the outdoor robot?

### **Check your understanding**
Which statement best describes the relationship between a robot's programming and its decision-making process?
A. Programming is only needed for advanced robots with artificial intelligence
B. Programming provides the rules and logic for how a robot processes information and makes decisions
C. Programming only affects the output devices and has no impact on decision-making
D. Programming automatically adjusts based on the robot's experiences without human intervention
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. Programming provides the rules and logic for how a robot processes information and makes decisions. Programming provides the fundamental rules, logic, and instructions that guide how a robot processes information from its input devices and determines appropriate responses. Without programming, a robot cannot interpret sensor data or decide on actions. If you chose a different answer, remember that all robots require programming for decision-making, not just advanced ones, and programming doesn't automatically self-adjust without human intervention.
## Key Takeaways
- The processing system serves as the robot's 'brain,' interpreting input data and determining appropriate outputs
- Robot processing can range from simple if-then logic to complex artificial intelligence algorithms
- The sophistication of a robot's processing system directly impacts its capabilities, adaptability, and autonomy

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 2.3
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 2 in the following ways:**
- This lesson covers the central 'processing' component of the input-processing-output model, building on the input systems from Lesson 2
- It prepares students to understand how processing leads to outputs in Lesson 4
- It helps students see how information flows through a complete robot system
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Sequencer game: Robot Logic Simulator - Students arrange programming blocks in the correct order to create a functional decision tree for a robot. For example, they must sequence blocks like "Check sensor," "If obstacle detected," "Turn right," "If no obstacle," "Move forward" to successfully navigate a virtual robot through different scenarios.
