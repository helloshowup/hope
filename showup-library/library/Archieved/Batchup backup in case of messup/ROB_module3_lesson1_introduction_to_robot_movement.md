# Introduction to Robot Movement
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Explain why movement is an essential output function for many robots
- Describe how robot movement connects to the input-processing-output model
- Identify at least three safety considerations for moving robots
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Robot Movement as an Output Function
A discussion exploring how robot movement serves as the crucial output response that allows robots to interact with and modify their environment.
## Understanding Robot Movement
[This section introduces the fundamental concepts of robot movement and its importance in robotics systems]
### Why Robots Need to Move
[Explores the various purposes of movement in robotics and how it enables robots to perform their intended functions]
### Moving vs. Non-Moving Robots
[Contrasts robots that require movement capabilities with stationary robots, highlighting their different applications]
## **Activity 1: Robot Movement Classification**
Students sort images of various robots based on whether they move or not, then categorize moving robots by purpose and movement type. Consider how each robot's movement capability relates to its function and what would happen if that movement capability was removed.
## Robot Movement in the Input-Processing-Output Framework
[This section explains how movement fits into the broader robotics information model]
### Movement as an Output Response
[Details how movement represents the "output" part of the input-processing-output model in robotics]
### From Sensors to Movement Decisions
[Describes the pathway from sensor data collection through processing to movement execution]
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the robots you've seen in your daily life. How many of them need to move to do their job? Why is movement essential for their function?

## Types of Robot Movement
[This section categorizes the various types of movement robots employ based on their design and purpose]
### Movement for Different Robot Jobs
[Examines how different applications require specific types of movement capabilities]
### Overview of Movement Methods
[Introduces various locomotion techniques used in robotics, from wheels to legs to aerial movement]
## Safety Considerations for Moving Robots
[This section addresses the important safety aspects of designing and working with robots that move]
### Physical Safety Features
[Explores built-in safety mechanisms that prevent robot movement from causing harm]
### Awareness and Predictability
[Discusses how robots signal their intentions and respond appropriately to their surroundings]
## **Activity 2: Movement Response Flowchart**
Create a simple flowchart showing how a robot might respond with movement based on different sensor inputs. For example, map out how a robot vacuum decides to move forward, turn, or reverse based on bump sensors, cliff sensors, or dirt detection sensors.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how a robot vacuum knows when to change direction. What inputs might it use, and how does its processor decide on movement?

### **Check your understanding**
Which of the following BEST describes why movement is considered an output function in robotics?
A. Movement happens before a robot can process information
B. Movement is how robots respond to their programming and sensor inputs
C. Movement is only used by robots to collect new information
D. Movement is what robots use instead of sensors
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is B. Movement is how robots respond to their programming and sensor inputs. Movement is considered an output function because it's how robots respond to or act upon the information they've processed from their inputs (like sensors). Movement is the result of processing, not the start of it.
## Key Takeaways
- Robot movement is a critical output function that allows robots to interact with and change their environment
- Robot movement follows the input-processing-output model, where movement decisions are based on sensor inputs and programmed instructions
- Safety considerations are essential when designing robots that move, including physical safety features and movement predictability

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 3.1
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 3 in the following ways:**
- This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of robot movement that will be explored in greater detail throughout the module
- It establishes why movement matters before examining specific movement methods
- It provides the foundation for understanding more complex robot movement systems in later lessons

**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Simulation Game: Robot Response Simulator where students must choose the appropriate movement response for a robot based on different sensor inputs in various scenarios. For example, if a delivery robot encounters an obstacle, students would need to select whether it should stop, navigate around, or take an alternate route based on its programming and sensor data.
