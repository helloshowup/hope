## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Identify different types of input devices used in robotics
- Explain how various sensors gather specific types of data
- Select appropriate input devices for specific robot applications
### Lesson Podcast Discussion: Understanding Robot Senses
A discussion exploring how different sensors allow robots to perceive and interact with their environment, similar to human senses but with unique capabilities.
## Introduction to Robot Inputs
This section introduces how robots gather information from their environment and why this is critical to their functioning.
### The Role of Input in Robot Systems
This subsection examines how input devices function as the first component of the robot's operational cycle.
### Why Robots Need Environmental Information
This subsection explores the importance of environmental data for robot decision-making and autonomous operation.
### The Sensor Revolution
This subsection covers how sensor technology has evolved and transformed robotic capabilities in recent years.
## **Activity 1: Sensor Scavenger Hunt**
Look around your home, classroom, or workplace to identify and classify different input devices in technology and everyday objects. Create a catalog of at least five different sensors you find, noting what each one detects (light, touch, sound, etc.), how it functions, and how similar technology might be used in robotics applications.
## Types of Input Devices
This section categorizes and explains the main types of sensors used in robotics systems.
### Contact Sensors (Touch, Pressure, Buttons)
This subsection details how physical contact sensors work and their applications in robotics.
### Environmental Sensors (Light, Temperature, Sound)
This subsection examines sensors that detect ambient conditions and how they help robots respond to their surroundings.
### Imaging Systems (Cameras, Infrared, Ultrasonic)
This subsection covers technologies that allow robots to visualize their environment and measure distances.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** If you were designing a robot to help someone with limited mobility, what input sensors would be most important and why? Consider how these sensors would help the robot understand the person's needs and navigate their environment safely.

## Sensor Applications
This section explores how sensors are implemented in real robotic systems.
### Sensors in Everyday Robots
This subsection examines sensor systems in common robots like vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers.
### Specialized Sensors for Specific Tasks
This subsection covers how specialized applications require specific sensing capabilities.
### Multi-Sensor Systems and Integration
This subsection explains how multiple sensors work together to provide comprehensive environmental awareness.
### **Check your understanding**
A robot needs to navigate safely around a room without bumping into objects. Which sensor would be MOST appropriate for this task?
A. Temperature sensor
B. Light sensor
C. Proximity sensor
D. Sound sensor
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. Proximity sensor. A proximity sensor is specifically designed to detect objects in the robot's path by measuring distance. This would allow the robot to detect obstacles before making contact with them. Temperature sensors measure heat, light sensors detect brightness levels, and sound sensors detect audioâ€”none of which would reliably prevent collisions with objects.
## **Activity 2: Robot Designer Challenge**
Design the input system for a robot with a specific purpose (e.g., classroom helper robot, environmental monitoring robot). Create a diagram or list of the sensors your robot would need and justify your selections based on the robot's function, environment, and interactions. Consider what information your robot needs to collect and how the sensors will work together as an integrated system.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** How do the input needs of a factory robot differ from those of a social companion robot? Think about the different environments, tasks, and interactions each type of robot would encounter and how this affects their sensor requirements.

## Key Takeaways
- Input devices serve as a robot's 'senses,' allowing it to gather information about its environment
- Different sensors are specialized to detect specific types of information (touch, light, sound, distance, etc.)
- The selection of input devices directly impacts what a robot can perceive and how it can interact with its environment

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 2.2
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 2 in the following ways:**
- This lesson builds on the input component of the input-processing-output model introduced in Lesson 1
- It provides specific details about input devices that will connect to the processing systems covered in Lesson 3
- It shows how information flows through a robot system, establishing the foundation for understanding complete robotic systems

**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Exploration Game - Sensor Mystery Box: A game where students interact with hidden sensors inside boxes and must identify what type of sensor it is based on how it responds to different stimuli. For example, a light sensor might trigger an LED when illuminated, and students must determine what kind of sensor causes the reaction.
