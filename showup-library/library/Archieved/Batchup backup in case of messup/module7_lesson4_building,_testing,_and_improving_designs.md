# Building, Testing, and Improving Designs
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Implement robot designs in either virtual or physical environments following structured procedures
- Conduct systematic tests to evaluate robot performance against design goals
- Apply test results to make specific, data-driven improvements to robot designs
## Lesson Podcast Discussion: Systematic Testing Approaches for Robotics
A discussion on how implementing structured testing protocols provides objective data that drives targeted improvements in robot design.
## Implementation Techniques
This section covers the foundational approaches to turning robot designs into functional prototypes, whether in virtual or physical environments.
### Build Planning and Preparation
This subsection addresses the preliminary steps before building, including materials gathering, workspace setup, and build sequence planning.
### Assembly Procedures and Best Practices
This subsection outlines efficient and effective techniques for assembling robot components, ensuring structural integrity and functional reliability.
### Virtual vs. Physical Implementation Considerations
This subsection compares the advantages, limitations, and specific approaches for both virtual simulation and physical construction of robot designs.
## **Activity 1: Test Plan Development and Execution**
Create a comprehensive test plan for your robot design that includes at least three specific test cases with clearly defined procedures, expected results, and data collection methods. Implement this plan by conducting tests and recording your observations in a structured format that will facilitate analysis.
## Systematic Testing Methods
This section explores structured approaches to evaluating robot performance against design goals and specifications.
### Designing Test Protocols
This subsection covers the development of comprehensive test plans with specific test cases to evaluate different aspects of robot functionality.
### Data Collection and Documentation
This subsection focuses on methods for capturing, organizing, and presenting performance data from robot tests.
### Performance Metrics and Benchmarks
This subsection examines quantitative measures to evaluate robot performance and how to establish appropriate benchmarks for success.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a test where your robot didn't perform as expected. What did this failure teach you about your design assumptions? Reflect on how this unexpected outcome revealed gaps in your understanding of the problem.

## Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
This section covers methodical approaches to identifying and resolving issues discovered during robot testing.
### Identifying Failure Points
This subsection addresses techniques for isolating specific components or systems that are not performing as expected.
### Root Cause Analysis
This subsection explores methods for determining the underlying causes of performance issues rather than just addressing symptoms.
### Systematic Debugging Approaches
This subsection covers structured approaches to methodically resolving issues in both mechanical systems and programming.
## Design Iteration Principles
This section explores the process of making targeted improvements based on test results to enhance robot performance.
### Making Targeted Improvements
This subsection focuses on implementing specific changes that address identified issues rather than wholesale redesign.
### Prioritizing Changes
This subsection covers methods for determining which changes will have the greatest impact on overall performance.
### Documenting Design Evolution
This subsection addresses the importance of tracking changes between design versions to understand progress and prevent regression.
## **Activity 2: Iteration Documentation**
Document improvements between at least two versions of your robot design using before/after comparisons. Create a table or chart that clearly shows what specific aspects were changed, why those changes were made based on test data, and how each change impacted performance. Include visual documentation if possible.
## Verification and Validation
This section covers methods for confirming that the improved design meets requirements and performs as expected in realistic conditions.
### Confirming Requirements Are Met
This subsection addresses systematic approaches to checking that all design specifications have been fulfilled.
### Validating Real-World Performance
This subsection explores testing under authentic conditions that match the intended operating environment.
### Final Design Documentation
This subsection covers comprehensive documentation of the final design, including rationale for design decisions and performance data.
## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** How did your understanding of the problem change through the testing and improvement process? Consider how your perception of what makes an effective solution evolved based on empirical evidence rather than initial assumptions.

### **Check your understanding**
Which approach to design improvement is most effective after initial testing?
A. Completely redesigning the robot from scratch based on test results
B. Making multiple major changes simultaneously to address all issues at once
C. Making targeted, incremental changes based on specific test data, then retesting
D. Focusing only on the programming aspects since mechanical issues are too difficult to fix
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is C. Making targeted, incremental changes based on specific test data, then retesting. The most effective approach to design improvement is to make specific, data-driven changes that address identified issues one at a time, followed by retesting. This methodical approach allows you to clearly see the impact of each change and avoids introducing new problems through overly broad modifications. If you chose a different answer, remember that incremental improvement allows for better tracking of cause and effect relationships between changes and performance.
## Key Takeaways
- Systematic testing provides objective data about design performance that guides improvements, enabling evidence-based decision making rather than guesswork
- Effective troubleshooting requires identifying root causes rather than just addressing symptoms, which leads to more permanent and comprehensive solutions
- Design iteration is a normal and expected part of the engineering process that leads to improved solutions, not an indication of initial failure

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 7.4
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 7 in the following ways:**
- It builds directly on the design plans created in Lesson 3, providing students with the skills to implement and test those designs
- It prepares students for the culminating challenges in Lesson 5 by teaching them how to systematically improve their designs based on test results
- It reinforces the iterative nature of the engineering design process that has been emphasized throughout the module
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Troubleshooting Simulation - "Debug Detective" - A problem-solving game where students are presented with robot designs that have specific performance issues and must identify the most likely causes and appropriate fixes. Example: A line-following robot that consistently loses the line on right turns might have sensor positioning, motor power, or algorithm timing issues to diagnose.
