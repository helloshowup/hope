# Template
[start of lesson]
# [h1] [must be 1st] 2.1
# [h1] [must be 2nd] Understanding Robot Systems
## [h2] [must be 3rd] Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Define what constitutes a 'system' in robotics context
- Explain the input-processing-output model with practical examples
- Compare robot systems to human systems and everyday technology
### [h2] [must be 4th] Lesson Podcast Discussion: Understanding the Input-Processing-Output Model in Robotics
This podcast should discuss how the input-processing-output model serves as a fundamental framework for understanding robot systems and their interactions with the environment.
## [h2] What is a System?
This section introduces the concept of systems as they exist in robotics and our everyday world, emphasizing how components work together toward specific goals.
### [h3] Systems in Our World
Overview of various systems we encounter daily and their defining characteristics.
### [h3] Parts Working Together
Exploration of how different components coordinate to form functional systems.
### [h3] System Boundaries and Interactions
Discussion of system boundaries and how systems interact with their environments.
## [h2] **Activity 1: System Mapping**
Map a system you use daily (like a smartphone or bicycle) by identifying its inputs, processing mechanisms, and outputs on the provided diagram. Consider what information the system takes in, how it processes that information, and what actions or results it produces.
## [h2] The Input-Processing-Output Model
This section breaks down the fundamental model for understanding how robotic systems function and interact with their environment.
### [h3] Input: Gathering Information
Exploration of how robots collect data from their environment through sensors and other input devices.
### [h3] Processing: Making Decisions
Discussion of how robots process information and make decisions based on inputs.
### [h3] Output: Taking Action
Examination of how robots produce actions or results based on their processing.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about your morning routine. How does it represent a system with inputs, processing, and outputs? Consider what information you take in, how you process it, and what actions result.

## [h2] Comparing Systems
This section examines parallels between robot systems and other types of systems to deepen understanding.
### [h3] Human Body as a System
Analysis of how the human body functions as a complex system with parallels to robotic systems.
### [h3] Everyday Technology Systems
Examples of common technologies that operate as systems similar to robots.
### [h3] Robot Systems Overview
Comprehensive look at how robot systems integrate the concepts covered in the lesson.
## [h2] **Activity 2: Human-Robot Comparison Chart**
Create a visual chart comparing human body systems (digestive, nervous, etc.) to equivalent robot systems. For each human system, identify what similar functions robots might need and what components would handle those functions.
## [h2] Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how inputs and outputs might differ between a robot vacuum cleaner and a robot used in space exploration. What unique challenges might each environment present to a robot's systems?

### **[h3] Check your understanding**
Which of the following best represents the input-processing-output model in a robot?
A. The robot has a battery that powers all its systems
B. The robot is made of lightweight materials for easier movement
C. The robot can be programmed using a computer
D. The robot has a camera, analyzes what it sees, and moves accordingly
Choose your answer and check it below.
The correct answer is D. The robot has a camera, analyzes what it sees, and moves accordingly. This option clearly shows all three components of the input-processing-output model: the camera serves as an input device gathering information, the robot analyzes this information (processing), and then takes action by moving (output). The other options describe important robot features but don't represent the complete input-processing-output cycle.
## [h2] Key Takeaways
- Robots function as systems with interconnected parts working together toward specific goals
- The input-processing-output model provides a framework for understanding how robots interact with their environment
- Many systems we encounter daily, including our own bodies, follow similar principles to robot systems

## Instructional designer notes of lesson 2.1
**This lesson fits into the the overall module of 2 in the following ways:**
- This lesson establishes the foundational concept of systems that will be explored in detail throughout the remaining lessons of the module
- Students will build on this understanding as they learn about specific input devices, processing units, and output mechanisms in subsequent lessons
**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Classification Game - System Sorting Challenge: A game where students sort various technologies (both robotic and non-robotic) into categories based on their inputs, processing capabilities, and outputs. For example, students might place a digital camera in the 'input device' category and a printer in the 'output device' category.
