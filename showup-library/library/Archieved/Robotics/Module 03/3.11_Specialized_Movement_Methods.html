<h1>Specialized Movement Methods</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name how robots can jump or hop to move</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tell how snake and inchworm robots get around</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Show how robots can roll or tumble to move</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jumping and Hopping Mechanisms</h3><p>Some robots are designed to move by jumping or hopping, which can be surprisingly effective for certain environments. These robots typically use springs, compressed air, or special motors to store energy and release it quickly, launching themselves into the air.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jumping robots</strong> excel at navigating rough terrain with lots of obstacles. While a wheeled robot might get stuck trying to climb over a rock, a jumping robot can simply hop over it! Some jumping robots can leap more than 30 times their own height. The Salto robot developed by UC Berkeley can jump higher than most NBA basketball players!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These robots are particularly useful for exploring places like disaster zones with rubble, rocky planets like Mars, or even for search and rescue operations where the ground might be uneven or dangerous. Some small jumping robots are being developed that could one day hop through your body to deliver medicine exactly where it's needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>New materials are making jumping robots even more impressive. Engineers are now using special elastic materials that can store and release energy like a super-powered rubber band. These materials help robots jump higher while using less battery power. Some jumping robots also use sensors to measure the ground beneath them, adjusting their jumps based on whether they're on soft sand or hard concrete.</p>
<h3>Snake-like and Inchworm Movement</h3><p><strong>Snake-like robots</strong> use a series of connected segments that bend and twist to create a slithering motion similar to real snakes. These robots excel at squeezing through tight spaces and can navigate through pipes, collapsed buildings, or other confined areas that wheels or legs can't access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some snake robots use small wheels or scales along their bodies to help them move forward, while others rely purely on the wave-like motion of their segments. They can climb poles, wrap around objects, and even swim in some cases. Engineers have used snake robots to inspect nuclear power plants, search for survivors in earthquake rubble, and perform minimally invasive surgery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Inchworm robots</strong> move by alternately gripping and releasing surfaces while extending and contracting their bodies. This slow but steady approach lets them climb vertical surfaces or move through very narrow spaces. Some inchworm robots can even climb up inside pipes against the flow of water or gas!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Carnegie Mellon University snake robot is a real-world example that shows how these designs solve practical problems. This robot has inspected damaged nuclear power plants in Japan after the Fukushima disaster, going into radioactive areas too dangerous for humans. Its camera and sensors send back valuable information while its snake-like body can move through tight spaces between debris. The robot's movement is controlled by special software that coordinates all its segments, making it move smoothly like a real snake.</p>
<h3>Rolling and Tumbling Designs</h3><p>Some of the most creative robot designs move by rolling or tumbling across terrain. <strong>Spherical robots</strong> contain all their components inside a ball-shaped shell that rolls in any direction. These robots are well-protected from dust and water and can move efficiently across flat surfaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other robots can transform their shape to roll when needed. The "Mixbot" can switch between walking on legs and tucking into a ball to roll down hills, saving energy. NASA has developed several tumbling robot concepts for exploring other planets, including a "tumbleweed rover" that would be blown across Mars by the wind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the most advanced rolling robots use a principle called <strong>tensegrity</strong>, where rigid parts are connected by flexible cables in a way that lets the whole structure absorb impacts while maintaining its shape. These robots can be dropped from heights or roll down steep slopes without breaking, making them ideal for exploring rough terrain on other planets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NASA's Super Ball Bot is a fascinating example of tensegrity in action. This robot looks like a jumble of rods and cables, but it can be dropped onto a planet's surface from space without a parachute! The flexible design absorbs the impact, and then the robot can roll across the surface by carefully adjusting the tension in different cables. This design is much lighter than traditional rovers with wheels and can explore more difficult terrain.</p>
