## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- List at least 3 ways robots can move
- Tell how a robot's job affects how it moves
- Pick the best way for a robot to move based on where it works

Some robots use **wheels** or **tracks** to roll smoothly across flat surfaces - like robot vacuums or delivery robots. Others use **legs** to walk or climb over uneven terrain - like four-legged inspection robots or humanoid robots. Some robots fly through the air using propellers or wings, while others swim underwater using fins or propulsion systems.

Even robots that stay in one place often have moving parts - like factory robot arms that can reach, grab, rotate, and place objects with amazing precision. These different movement capabilities allow robots to work in almost any environment humans can imagine, from our living rooms to the depths of the ocean or even the surface of Mars!

### **Movement for Different Robot Jobs**

Different robot jobs require different types of movement. The way a robot moves is closely tied to what it needs to accomplish.

For **transportation robots** like self-driving cars or delivery drones, movement is all about getting from point A to point B efficiently and safely. These robots need to navigate through complex environments while avoiding obstacles and following traffic rules.

For **manufacturing robots**, movement is about precision and repeatability. Robot arms in factories need to perform the exact same movements thousands of times with perfect accuracy, whether they're welding car parts or assembling electronics.

For **exploration robots** like Mars rovers or deep-sea submersibles, movement must be adaptable to unknown and challenging environments. These robots need robust movement systems that can handle rough terrain, extreme temperatures, or high pressure.

For **service robots** like hospital delivery robots or restaurant serving robots, movement must be gentle and predictable around humans. These robots need to navigate crowded spaces without bumping into people or causing disruptions.

Each of these specialized jobs requires a different approach to robot movement, which is why we see such a wide variety of movement systems in robotics.

### **Choosing the Right Movement Method**

When engineers choose a movement method for a robot, they consider several important factors:
- **Environment**: Will the robot operate on smooth floors, rough terrain, in water, or in the air?
- **Task requirements**: Does the robot need to move quickly, carry heavy items, or navigate tight spaces?
- **Energy efficiency**: How long does the robot need to operate between charges?
- **Cost**: What's the budget for building the robot?
- **Safety**: Will the robot work around people or fragile objects?

For example, a robot designed to help in a classroom might use wheels because they're energy-efficient and work well on smooth floors. But a robot designed to explore a rocky beach might use legs to climb over obstacles that wheels couldn't handle.

### **Overview of Movement Methods**

Let's explore the main ways robots can move, each designed for specific situations:

**Wheeled movement** is one of the simplest and most efficient methods for flat surfaces. Wheels provide smooth, fast movement and are relatively easy to control. Robot vacuums, delivery robots, and many educational robots use wheels. Some robots use special omnidirectional wheels that can move in any direction without turning.

**Tracked movement** uses continuous tracks (like tank treads) instead of wheels. This provides better grip and stability on rough or slippery surfaces. Search and rescue robots often use tracks to navigate through disaster areas.

**Legged movement** mimics how animals walk. Robots might have two legs (bipedal), four legs (quadrupedal), or even six or more legs. Legged robots can step over obstacles and navigate uneven terrain, but they're more complex to design and control. Boston Dynamics' Spot (a four-legged robot) and Atlas (a humanoid robot) are famous examples.

**Aerial movement** allows robots to fly. Drones typically use multiple propellers (quadcopters have four), while other flying robots might use fixed wings like airplanes or flapping wings like birds or insects.

**Aquatic movement** helps robots swim underwater. Some use propellers, while others mimic fish with fin-like movements. Some even use jet propulsion similar to octopuses or squids!

**Robotic arms** don't change location but use joints to move in multiple directions. These arms can rotate, extend, and manipulate objects with great precision.

### **Technological Advances in Robot Movement**

Recent advances in materials and technology are making robot movement even more impressive. For example:
- New **lightweight materials** help flying robots stay in the air longer
- Better **batteries** allow robots to move for extended periods without recharging
- Improved **artificial intelligence** helps robots make smarter movement decisions
- **Soft robotics** (using flexible materials) allows robots to move in ways that were previously impossible
