# ****Programming Decision Trees****

To create responsive behaviors, we use decision trees in our programming. A decision tree is like a flowchart that helps the robot decide what to do next based on sensor information.

Here's a simple example of a decision tree for a robot navigating a room:

```
Check front distance sensor
If distance < 20 cm:
    Check left distance sensor
    If left distance > 30 cm:
        Turn left
    Else:
        Check right distance sensor
        If right distance > 30 cm:
            Turn right
        Else:
            Turn around
Else:
    Move forward
```

This decision tree helps the robot avoid obstacles by checking sensors and making movement decisions based on what it detects. The robot first checks if there's an obstacle directly ahead. If there is, it looks for clear space to the left or right. If there's no clear path in any direction, it turns around.

More complex decision trees can handle many different sensor inputs and situations. For example, a search and rescue robot might use temperature sensors, cameras, microphones, and distance sensors together to find people in a disaster area, with a decision tree that prioritizes investigating areas with signs of human presence.

By combining sensors with well-designed decision trees, robots can navigate complex environments and respond appropriately to changing conditions - much like animals do in nature.

### **Sensors in Action: Real-World Examples**

Let's look at how different sensors help robots move in the real world:

**Robot Vacuum Cleaners**: These popular home robots use several sensors working together. Bump sensors tell the robot when it hits something, cliff sensors prevent it from falling down stairs, and some models use cameras to map your home. All these sensors feed information to the robot's program, which decides how to move next - just like you might navigate around furniture in a dark room by feeling your way.

**Line-Following Robots**: Many beginner robots use simple light sensors to follow a dark line on a light background. When the sensor detects the robot moving off the line, it signals the wheels to adjust - turning left if the robot drifts right, or turning right if it drifts left. This creates a zigzag pattern that keeps the robot following the line, similar to how you might follow a trail in the woods.

**Drone Obstacle Avoidance**: Modern drones use distance sensors (like sonar or infrared) to detect obstacles in their path. When flying toward a tree, the sensors detect the obstacle and automatically adjust the drone's flight path to avoid collision. Some advanced drones can navigate through forests without hitting branches - similar to how birds fly through dense trees.

These examples show how sensors act like robot "senses" - providing the information needed to make smart movement decisions, just like your eyes, ears, and sense of touch help you move through the world.

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider a robot that needs to navigate around obstacles. What decision process would it need to follow? How would you program this? Think about the sensors the robot would need and the logical steps in its decision-making process.

A robotics team is designing a robot to climb vertical surfaces. Which animal would provide the MOST useful biomimicry inspiration?

A. Kangaroo

B. Gecko

C. Dolphin

D. Ostrich
---answer---
The correct answer is B. Gecko. Geckos can climb virtually any surface thanks to millions of microscopic hairs on their feet that create molecular attraction. Gecko-inspired adhesion has been successfully used in climbing robots, making them the most useful inspiration for vertical climbing capabilities. If you chose a different answer, consider why the animal's movement specialization might not be suited for vertical climbing - kangaroos excel at jumping, dolphins at swimming, and ostriches at running.
