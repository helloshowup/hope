# **Types of Motors for Different Movement Needs**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Name the three main types of motors used in robots
- Explain how each motor type moves in a unique way
- List tasks where each motor works best

### **Servo Motors for Precise Control**

**Servo motors** are the precision experts of the robot world. What makes them special is their built-in feedback system that constantly monitors their position. When you tell a servo motor to move to a specific angle (like 45 degrees), it will move to that exact position and hold it there, even if something tries to push it away.

Inside a servo motor is a small control circuit, a position sensor, and a regular motor with gears. The sensor detects the current position, and the control circuit adjusts the power to the motor until it reaches the exact position you requested.

This precision makes servo motors perfect for robot arms, steering mechanisms, and camera mounts. For example, a robot that needs to pick up delicate objects uses servo motors to position its gripper at exactly the right angle. Most servo motors can only rotate about 180 degrees rather than spinning continuously, which is perfect for tasks requiring precise angular positioning.

### **DC Motors for Continuous Movement**

**DC Motors** (Direct Current) motors are the workhorses of robotics. They're simple, reliable, and excellent for continuous rotation. When you connect a DC motor to a power source, it spins continuously until you turn off the power.

DC motors come in various sizes and strengths. Smaller ones might power a toy robot's wheels, while larger ones could drive an industrial robot. They're ideal for applications where continuous movement is needed, such as:

- Driving wheels on a mobile robot
- Powering conveyor belts in automated systems
- Running fans for cooling electronic components
- Spinning robot vacuum cleaner brushes

You can control the speed of a DC motor by changing the voltage supplied to it. More voltage means faster spinning. To change direction, you simply reverse the electrical connections. While not as precise as servo motors, DC motors are perfect when you need reliable, continuous motion.

### **Stepper Motors for Incremental Movement**

**Stepper motors** move in precise, fixed steps rather than spinning continuously. Each electrical pulse sent to the motor makes it rotate by one small, exact increment or "step." Most stepper motors have 200 steps per full rotation, meaning each step is 1.8 degrees.

This step-by-step movement gives stepper motors excellent precision without needing the feedback system that servo motors use. They're like digital motors in a world of analog ones - moving in discrete chunks rather than smooth continuous motion.

Stepper motors excel in applications requiring precise positioning, such as:

- 3D printers, where the print head must move in exact increments
- CNC machines that cut materials with precision
- Camera sliders that need smooth, controlled movement
- Robot joints that need to move to specific positions

While they're not as fast as DC motors, their precision and reliability make them invaluable for many robotic applications where exact positioning matters more than speed.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time you've used a simple machine like a lever or pulley. How did it make the task easier? How might robots use the same principles?
