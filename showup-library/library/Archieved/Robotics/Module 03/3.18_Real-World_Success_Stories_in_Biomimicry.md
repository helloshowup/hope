## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- **Name 3 robots** that copy animal moves
- **Explain how** animal moves help solve robot problems
- **Create a simple set** of steps to make a robot move in a pattern

Let's look at some exciting examples of how animal movement has been successfully copied in real robots:

**Gecko-Inspired Climbing Robots**: Scientists at Stanford University created a robot called "**Stickybot**" that can climb smooth vertical surfaces like glass. The robot uses special adhesive pads inspired by gecko feet, which have millions of tiny hairs that create a molecular attraction to surfaces. These robots could someday help with building inspections or window cleaning on skyscrapers!

**Salamander-Inspired Amphibious Robot**: Researchers in Switzerland built a robot called "**Pleurobot**" that can both walk on land and swim in water just like a salamander. By carefully studying salamander skeletons and movements, they created a robot that smoothly transitions between environments - perfect for monitoring lakes and shorelines.

**Kangaroo-Inspired Jumping Robot**: Engineers at Festo created "**BionicKangaroo**," a robot that captures the energy-efficient jumping motion of real kangaroos. The robot stores energy from each landing to power its next jump, just like real kangaroos do. This energy-saving technique could help create more efficient robots for package delivery or exploration.

These examples show how studying nature's solutions can lead to breakthrough technologies that might not have been discovered through traditional engineering approaches.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about an animal that moves in an interesting way. How might its movement strategy solve a robot design challenge? Consider the unique aspects of that animal's locomotion and how those principles could address specific robotic movement problems.

## **Basic Movement Programming**
Now that we understand how robots can be designed to move like animals, let's explore how we actually tell robots to move using programming.

### **Movement Commands and Sequences**
Programming a robot to move starts with **basic commands** - the simple instructions that control individual actions. These are like the building blocks of robot movement. Common movement commands include:

- **move_forward(distance)**
- **turn_left(degrees)**
- **turn_right(degrees)**
- **stop()**
- **set_speed(value)**

These commands by themselves only create very simple movements. To make a robot perform useful tasks, we need to combine these commands into **sequences** - ordered lists of instructions that the robot follows one after another.

For example, to make a robot navigate around a square path, we might create this sequence:
1. move_forward(10)
2. turn_right(90)
3. move_forward(10)
4. turn_right(90)
5. move_forward(10)
6. turn_right(90)
7. move_forward(10)

When the robot follows this sequence, it will trace a square pattern. By changing the order of commands or adding new ones, we can create an endless variety of movement patterns. Think of it like a dance routine - each step must be performed in the right order to create the complete dance.

## **Key Takeaways**
- Robots can copy animal movements to solve problems, like **gecko-inspired robots** that climb walls and **salamander robots** that walk and swim.
- Programming robot movement uses **simple commands** (like move_forward and turn_right) combined in **sequences** to create patterns, similar to steps in a dance routine.
- Studying how animals move in nature helps engineers create **breakthrough technologies** they might not discover through traditional methods.
