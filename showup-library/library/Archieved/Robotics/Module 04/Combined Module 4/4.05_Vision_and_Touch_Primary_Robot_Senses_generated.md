# STUDY NOTES: VISION AND TOUCH - PRIMARY ROBOT SENSES

## KEY CONCEPTS

### Robot Vision Fundamentals
- **Robot vision systems**: Technologies allowing robots to detect and understand visual information
- **Purpose**: Navigation, object recognition, decision-making based on visual input
- **Difference from human vision**: Uses various sensors and computer programs to process visual data

### Vision Sensing Technologies
- **Light Sensors/Photoreceptors**:
  * Photocells/photoresistors: Change electrical resistance based on light exposure
  * Photodiodes: Convert light into electrical current
  * Applications: Detecting brightness levels, shadows, contrasts

- **Camera Systems**:
  * Function similar to smartphone cameras
  * Capture detailed environmental images through lenses
  * Convert visual information to digital data

- **Image Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Image capture
  2. Pre-processing (brightness/clarity adjustment)
  3. Feature detection (identifying shapes/edges)
  4. Object recognition
  5. Decision making

- **Color Detection & Pattern Recognition**:
  * Analyzes wavelengths of reflected light
  * Compares visual input to learned patterns
  * Enables object identification, face recognition, text reading

## CRITICAL APPLICATIONS

### Navigation & Object Detection
- Enables robots to:
  * Create environmental maps
  * Identify pathways
  * Avoid obstacles
  * Recognize specific objects
  * Adjust behavior based on visual input

### Quality Control & Inspection
