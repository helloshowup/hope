# STUDY NOTES: FROM SENSING TO ACTION

## Core Concepts & Learning Objectives
* **Information Pathway in Robotics**
  * Sensor input collection → Data processing → Action triggering
  * Conversion of physical information to electrical signals
  * Interpretation of data through programmed rules
  * Response execution based on processed information

* **Sensor Input Collection**
  * Sensors function as robot "eyes and ears"
  * Different sensor types detect specific environmental data
    * Light sensors (brightness)
    * Distance sensors (proximity)
    * Touch sensors (contact)
    * Temperature sensors (heat levels)
  * Physical information converted to electrical signals (raw data)

* **Data Processing and Interpretation**
  * Raw data filtered and interpreted using programmed rules
  * Data cleaning techniques
    * Averaging multiple readings to reduce errors
    * Threshold filtering (responding only to values above/below certain points)
  * Conversion of numerical values to meaningful information

## Decision-Making Frameworks

* **Simple Logic Structures**
  * If-then statements: basic conditional response
    * Example: "IF temperature > 30°C, THEN activate cooling fan"
  * If-then-else structures: comprehensive decision coverage
    * Example: "IF object within 10cm, THEN stop/turn, ELSE continue forward"

* **Multi-Sensor Integration**
  * Robots combine multiple sensor inputs for comprehensive environmental awareness
  * Logical operators for sensor integration:
    * "AND" logic (all conditions must be true)
    * "OR" logic (any condition can trigger response)
  * Real-world application: self-driving cars using cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors
    * Priority given to collision avoidance

* **Conflict Resolution Strategies**
  * Sensor hierarchy: prioritizing certain sensors in specific situations
  * Safety-related sensors typically given highest priority
  * Backup systems implementation for sensor failure scenarios
  * Redundancy ensures continued operation if primary sensors fail
