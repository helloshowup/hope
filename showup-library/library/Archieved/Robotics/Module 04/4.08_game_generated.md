# 4.08 Problem-solving game

## Study Notes: Sensor Detective

### Key Concepts
* Robots use different sensors to gather information about their environment
* Sensor selection depends on the specific problem to be solved
* Understanding sensor capabilities is crucial for effective robot design

### Learning Objectives
* Identify appropriate sensors for specific environmental challenges
* Explain sensor functionality in relation to problem-solving
* Apply logical reasoning to match sensors with detection needs

### Critical Connections
* Relationship between environmental conditions and sensor selection
* Link between sensor capabilities and robot functionality
* Connection between problem constraints and appropriate technology solutions

### Assessment Points
* Ability to match sensors to appropriate scenarios
* Understanding of sensor limitations and strengths
* Reasoning skills in explaining sensor selection decisions
* Application of sensor knowledge to novel situations

### Game Structure
* Students presented with mystery scenarios requiring environmental detection
* Challenge: determine most appropriate sensor for each scenario
* Example scenario: dark room navigation without furniture collision
* Students must justify their sensor selection with reasoning
