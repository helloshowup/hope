<h2>Touch and Bump Sensing</h2>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell how touch sensors help robots feel things</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Show how bump sensors help robots avoid hitting things</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>List ways touch sensing keeps robots and people safe
While vision allows robots to perceive their environment from a distance, touch sensing gives them information about physical contact with objects and surfaces. Touch is a critical sense for robots, helping them interact safely with their surroundings and respond appropriately to physical contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Touch Sensors Work</h3><p><strong>Touch sensors</strong> allow robots to detect when they've made physical contact with something in their environment. There are several different types of touch sensors, each working in a unique way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pressure sensors</strong> detect the amount of force applied to them. When something presses against the sensor, it measures how hard the pressure is. These sensors often use materials that change their electrical properties when compressed. For example, some pressure sensors contain a special material that becomes more conductive (allows more electricity to flow) when pressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Capacitive touch sensors</strong> work similarly to the touchscreen on your phone or tablet. They detect changes in electrical fields when something conductive (like a human finger) touches or comes near them. These sensors don't require physical pressure - just proximity to a conductive object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Resistive touch sensors</strong> consist of two layers separated by a small gap. When pressure is applied, the layers connect, completing an electrical circuit. These sensors are often used in simple robot applications because they're inexpensive and easy to implement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>![Diagram showing three types of touch sensors: pressure, capacitive, and resistive, with simple illustrations of how each works]</p>
<h3>Bump Detection and Collision Avoidance</h3><p><strong>Bump sensors</strong> are a specific type of touch sensor that help robots detect when they've collided with an obstacle. These sensors are typically placed around the outer edges of a robot, especially on mobile robots that need to navigate through spaces with potential obstacles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a robot equipped with bump sensors hits an object, the sensor triggers a signal that tells the robot's control system about the collision. The robot can then respond by stopping, changing direction, or taking other appropriate actions to avoid damage to itself or the object it bumped into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, a robot vacuum cleaner uses bump sensors to detect when it hits furniture or walls. When the sensor is triggered, the robot backs up, turns, and tries a new direction. This simple system allows the robot to navigate around obstacles even without complex vision systems.</p>
<h4>Cutting-Edge Touch Sensing Technologies</h4><p>Recent advancements in touch sensing are making robots more responsive and safer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artificial skin</strong> made of flexible materials with embedded sensors that can detect touch across the entire surface of a robot</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Force-feedback sensors</strong> that not only detect contact but measure exactly how much pressure is being applied</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texture-sensing fingertips</strong> that can detect the difference between rough and smooth surfaces, helping robots handle objects more carefully</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed sensor networks</strong> that use multiple small sensors to create a detailed map of contact points</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft touch sensors</strong> made of stretchy materials that can bend and flex with the robot's movement</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These technologies are helping robots work more safely alongside humans in homes, schools, and workplaces.</p>
<h3>Safety Applications of Touch Sensing</h3><p>Touch sensing plays a crucial role in robot safety, especially for robots that work alongside humans. Safety is a top priority in robotics, and touch sensors help ensure that robots can detect unexpected contact and respond appropriately to prevent injuries or damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many industrial robots are equipped with <strong>force-sensing technology</strong> that can detect when they encounter unexpected resistance. If a robot arm feels more force than it should while moving, it might be colliding with a person or object that shouldn't be there. The robot can immediately stop or change its movement to prevent injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Emergency stop systems</strong> often incorporate touch sensing. For example, some collaborative robots (cobots) have sensitive skin-like coverings that can detect even gentle contact with a human. When touched, these robots can immediately pause their operation until it's safe to continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Touch sensing is also important for <strong>human-robot interaction</strong>. Robots designed to work directly with people, such as therapy robots or assistive devices, use touch sensors to respond appropriately to human contact. A therapy robot might detect a gentle pat and respond positively, while also recognizing if it's being handled roughly and adjusting its behavior accordingly.</p>

                <p>The correct answer is B. To detect and process visual information from their environment. Vision sensors allow robots to detect and process visual information from their environment, enabling them to recognize objects, navigate spaces, and respond to visual cues. If you chose a different answer, remember that robots use vision sensors to receive and interpret visual data, not to produce light or heat.</p>
