## Basic Robot Ethics Concepts

- Robot ethics means making sure robots are designed and used in ways that help people and don't cause harm
- Robot ethics is different from regular ethics because it focuses on how machines interact with humans
- Robot ethics is becoming more important as robots become part of our everyday lives
- Examples of everyday robots include:
  - Robot vacuums in homes
  - Delivery robots on sidewalks

## Key Ethical Questions in Robotics

- Is this robot safe?
- Does it respect people's privacy?
- Could it replace jobs?
- Could it change how people interact with each other?

## Why Robot Ethics Matters

- The robots created today will shape the world we live in tomorrow
- Young roboticists have the power to design robots that make positive contributions to society
- Understanding ethics helps create technology that people can trust
- Ethics helps ensure robots improve lives rather than causing problems

## Three Main Reasons Ethics Matter in Robotics

- Robots can directly affect people's safety and wellbeing
- As robots get smarter, they make more decisions on their own
- Robots are becoming more common in our everyday lives (homes, schools, hospitals, streets)

## Real-World Examples of Robots with Ethical Considerations

- Robot vacuum cleaners
  - Collect data about home layouts
  - Some models have cameras
  - Raise questions about data security

- Delivery robots
  - Navigate sidewalks to deliver food or packages
  - Raise questions about accessibility for wheelchair users

## Input Stage Ethics
- Privacy concerns when robots collect information
  - Robots may record people without their knowledge or permission
  - Example: School hallway robots using facial recognition without asking
  - Question of what happens to collected images
- Data collection bias issues
  - Some early facial recognition systems didn't work well for people with darker skin tones
  - This happened because these people weren't included enough in training data
- Consent considerations
  - Whether people should be told when robots collect information about them
  - Whether people should have the right to refuse data collection
  - Particularly important in public spaces where people can't easily avoid robots

## Processing Stage Ethics
- Transparency in robot decision-making
  - People should understand how and why robots make decisions
  - Example: Teaching robots deciding which students need more help
  - Mysterious decision-making can reduce trust in robots
- Bias in algorithms
  - Rules and patterns robots follow might treat some people unfairly
  - Example: Job application robots trained on past hiring data might continue unfair patterns
- Responsibility questions
  - Who is responsible when robots make bad decisions
  - Possible responsible parties: programmers, companies, or users

## Output Stage Ethics
- Safety concerns
  - Robots that move or manipulate objects could hurt people or damage property
  - Example: Collaborative factory robots designed to stop if they touch a person
- Environmental impact considerations
  - Energy usage of robots
  - Materials robots are made from
  - Whether robots can be recycled

# EASY Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Basic Robot Ethics Concepts
- Robot ethics evaluates whether a robot design is good or bad for people
- Robots can be designed for different purposes:
  - To help people
  - To entertain
  - To make money

## Key Ethical Criteria

- Fair distribution of benefits is important in robot design

## Essential Ethical Questions
- "Who might be affected by this robot?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "Is this robot accessible to everyone who needs it?"
- "How might this robot change over time?"

## Cultural Perspectives
- Different cultures have different views about robots
- In Japan, robots are often seen as helpful friends or companions
- In some Western countries, people might be more worried about robots replacing jobs

## Examples
- Educational robots might increase inequality if they only work for students with advantages
- Healthcare robots might have unfair benefit distribution if they only help wealthy patients
- LEGO involved teachers, education experts, parents, and students when designing math robots

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Identifying Necessary vs. Optional Features

- **Necessary features** are those that the robot needs to accomplish its core purpose
- A robot vacuum cleaner needs:
  - Wheels to move
  - Brushes to clean
  - Sensors to avoid falling down stairs

- **Optional features** might make a robot more convenient but aren't required for its main function
  - Example: A camera that creates a map of your home

- Questions designers can ask to determine if a feature is necessary:
  - "Can the robot still perform its core function without this feature?"
  - "Does the benefit of this feature outweigh the potential risks?"

- Example of necessary vs. optional features in a robot for people with disabilities:
  - Necessary: Sensors to detect obstacles
  - Optional: A camera that constantly records everything

## Privacy-by-Design Principles

- **Privacy-by-Design** means considering privacy from the very beginning of creating a robot

- Key principles include:
  - **Data minimization**: Collecting only information that's absolutely necessary
  - **Purpose limitation**: Using data only for the specific reason it was collected
  - **Transparency**: Clearly explaining what data is being collected and why
  - **User control**: Giving people choices about what data is collected and how it's used

- Example of Privacy-by-Design in a school robot:
  - Only collecting data about math problems students solve
  - Using this data only to adjust teaching difficulty
  - Having a clear display showing when it's recording
  - Letting students or teachers easily delete their data

## Robot Design Balance

- Robot designers need to create products that:
  - Work well for their intended purpose
  - Minimize unnecessary risks to safety and privacy
  - Build trust with users
