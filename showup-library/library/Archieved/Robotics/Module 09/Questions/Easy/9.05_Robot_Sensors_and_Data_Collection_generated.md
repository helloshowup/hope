# Robot Sensors and Data Collection - EASY Content

## Types of Data Robots Collect

- **Visual data**
  - Comes from cameras that allow robots to "see"
  - Captures images and videos of people, objects, and spaces
  - Some robots use 3D cameras to measure distances
  - Robot vacuums use visual sensors to avoid furniture

- **Audio data**
  - Collected through microphones
  - Allows robots to "hear" sounds, voices, and commands
  - Voice-activated robots listen for wake words like "Hey Siri" or "Alexa"
  - Records what you say after the wake word

- **Location and movement data**
  - Helps robots know where they are
  - Uses sensors like GPS, accelerometers, and gyroscopes
  - Tracks position, speed, and direction
  - Delivery robots use this to navigate

- **Interaction data**
  - Information about how people use robots
  - Includes button presses, commands given, and feature usage
  - Helps robots learn user preferences

## How Robots Store Data

- **Local storage**
  - Information stays inside the robot itself
  - Similar to saving photos on your phone
  - Can be more private
  - Data doesn't leave the device

- **Cloud storage**
  - Data is sent to remote servers through the internet
  - Allows for more powerful processing
  - Enables robots to learn from many users' experiences
  - Raises more privacy concerns

## Privacy Protection Basics

- **Privacy vulnerabilities**
  - Data breaches where hackers steal information
  - Companies using data in unexpected ways

- **Protection methods**
  - Encryption to scramble data
  - Access controls that limit who can view information
  - Privacy policies that explain data collection
  - Privacy settings on the robot

- **User actions for privacy**
  - Review privacy settings
  - Turn off features when not needed (microphones, cameras)
  - Be careful about what information you share with robots
