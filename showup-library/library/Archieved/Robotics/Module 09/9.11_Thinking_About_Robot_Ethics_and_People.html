<h1>Thinking About Robot Ethics and People</h1>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2><p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List at least three groups of people who are affected by robots</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explain why robots need to be made for people with different needs</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Show how robots can be designed to work well for everyone</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Matters in Robot Design?</h2><p>When we create robots, we need to think about all the different people who will be affected by them. This helps us make better robots that work well for everyone.</p>
<h3>People Affected by Robots</h3><p>Different people will interact with robots in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: People who will directly use or work with the robot</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bystanders</strong>: People who might be near the robot but aren't using it</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helpers</strong>: People who fix or clean the robot</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong>: Schools, hospitals, or companies that own the robot</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community members</strong>: People living in areas where robots operate</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, a school hallway robot might affect students, teachers, janitors, visitors, and the school principal - all in different ways!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Making sure we think about everyone who might encounter a robot is an important first step in creating robots that are fair and helpful.</p>
<h3>Different People Have Different Needs</h3><p>Not everyone wants or needs the same things from a robot. What works well for one person might cause problems for someone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, with a classroom helper robot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers might want a robot that helps grade papers</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Students might want a robot that explains difficult concepts</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Janitors need the robot to not get in the way during cleaning</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The principal needs to make sure the robot is safe for everyone</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good robot designers talk to many different people to understand what they need. They might use surveys or group discussions to learn what matters most to each group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                </div>
                <div class="stop-reflect-content" style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; padding:15px; width:80%;">
                    <h3 style="color:#000000; margin-top:0;">
                    </h3><p> Think about a robot designed to help in a grocery store. Who are three different types of people who might interact with this robot? How might their needs be different from each other?</p>
                </div>
            </div></p>
<h3>When People Want Different Things</h3><p>Sometimes different people want things from a robot that don't match up. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students might want a fast-moving robot that can quickly deliver items</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Teachers might want a slower robot that won't disrupt class</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Someone using a wheelchair might need the robot to move at a certain height</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When this happens, robot designers can:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find creative solutions</strong>: Maybe the robot moves quickly in empty hallways but slows down in crowded areas</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focus on what's most important</strong>: Safety usually comes before speed or convenience</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make adjustable robots</strong>: Create robots that can be set up differently for different situations</li>
</ol>
<h2>Making Robots for Everyone</h2><p>It's important to create robots that everyone can use, no matter their abilities or background. This is called <strong>inclusive design</strong>.</p>
<h3>Designing for Different Abilities</h3><p>People have different abilities when it comes to seeing, hearing, moving, or understanding. Good robot design takes these differences into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, a robot might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice commands for people who can't use touch screens</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lights or screen messages for people who can't hear beeps</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simple, clear instructions with pictures</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Controls that are easy to reach from different heights</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best robots work well for as many people as possible without needing special changes. For instance, a robot with both voice commands and buttons works for people who can see, people who can hear, and people who can do both.</p>
<h3>Making Robots Work Across Cultures</h3><p>Robots should work well for people from all backgrounds and situations. This means thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different languages people speak</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cultural customs and gestures</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Access to technology</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Different living environments</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, a robot designed for use around the world should speak multiple languages and avoid gestures that might be rude in some cultures. A robot for public spaces should be easy to use even for people who don't have much experience with technology.</p>
<h3>Testing with Many Different People</h3><p>The best way to make sure robots work for everyone is to test them with many different types of people, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young people and older adults</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People with different abilities</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People from different cultural backgrounds</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People with different levels of technology experience</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When testing, designers should watch how different people interact with the robot and listen to their feedback. Often, users will point out problems that designers never thought about.</p>

                    </h3><p> Think about a robot that could help in your school. How would you design it so that EVERYONE could use it easily? Consider what features you would include to make sure the robot works well for someone who:
- Uses a wheelchair
- Speaks a different language
- Has never used a robot before
- Has trouble seeing or hearing</p>

            <p>When designing a robot for a public library, which approach best demonstrates ethical decision-making?</p>
<p>A. Designing the robot to be as technologically advanced as possible</p>
<p>B. Making the robot look exactly like a human librarian</p>
<p>C. Ensuring the robot can complete tasks as quickly as possible</p>
<p>D. Considering the needs of users with different abilities, ages, and technological comfort levels</p>

                </p>
                <p>The correct answer is D. Considering the needs of users with different abilities, ages, and technological comfort levels. Ethical decision-making in robot design involves considering the diverse needs of all potential users. A library serves people of varying ages, abilities, and comfort with technology, so the robot should be designed to be accessible and usable by everyone who might encounter it. If you chose a different answer, remember that technological advancement, human-like appearance, or speed are not necessarily ethical priorities if they don't serve the needs of diverse users.</p>
