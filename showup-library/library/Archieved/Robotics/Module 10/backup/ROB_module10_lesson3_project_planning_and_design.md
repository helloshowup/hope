# **Project Planning and Design**

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Apply the engineering design process to develop a detailed project plan addressing a specific problem or purpose
- Create initial designs or specifications incorporating the input-processing-output framework
- Integrate ethical considerations into the project planning process from the beginning

### **Lesson Podcast Discussion: Ethical Design in Robotics Projects**

When we design robots, we need to think about more than just making them work. We also need to consider how they might affect people and our world. Ethical design means thinking about these effects from the very beginning of our project.

For example, if you're designing a robot to help elderly people, you need to make sure it's safe, easy to use, and respects their privacy. By thinking about these ethical issues early, you can create robots that not only solve problems but also make a positive difference.

Many robotics engineers say that considering ethics from the start leads to better designs. It helps you avoid problems later and creates robots that people trust and want to use. Remember, a robot that works perfectly but causes harm or makes people uncomfortable isn't really a successful design.

## **Defining Your Project Scope**

Before you start building your robot, you need to know exactly what you're trying to create. **Project scope** is like drawing a boundary around your project. It helps you focus on what's important and avoid getting distracted by too many ideas.

A clear project scope answers questions like: What problem will your robot solve? Who will use it? What should it do? What should it not do? Having these answers will make your project much easier to complete successfully.

Think of project scope like a recipe - it tells you what ingredients you need and what steps to follow. Without a good recipe, your cooking might not turn out as planned!

### **Problem Statement Development**

A **problem statement** is a clear description of the issue your robot will solve. It's like the foundation of a building - everything else is built on top of it.

A good problem statement:
- Clearly identifies the problem
- Explains who is affected by the problem
- Describes why solving this problem matters
- Is specific enough to guide your design

For example, instead of saying "I want to build a robot that helps people," a better problem statement would be: "Elderly people living alone often struggle to pick up items they drop on the floor, which can lead to falls and injuries. A robot that can safely retrieve fallen objects would help them maintain independence."

When writing your problem statement, ask yourself: What exactly is the problem? Who has this problem? Why does it matter? Your answers will help you create a focused statement that guides your project.

### **User Needs Analysis**

Understanding the people who will use your robot is crucial for good design. **User needs analysis** helps you discover what your users really want and need.

To analyze user needs:
1. Identify your primary users - Who will use your robot most?
2. Talk to potential users - Ask them about their challenges and wishes
3. Observe users in their environment - See how they currently handle the problem
4. Create user personas - Detailed descriptions of typical users
5. List specific needs - What must your robot do to help these users?

For instance, if designing a robot to help students organize their desks, you might discover they need a robot that can sort small items, is quiet enough to use during class, and can finish its job quickly between classes.

Remember that users often have needs they don't mention at first. By watching them and asking good questions, you can discover these hidden needs and create a better robot.

### **Setting Clear Project Boundaries**

Project boundaries help you decide what your robot will and won't do. Without clear boundaries, your project might grow too big to finish - this is called "**scope creep**."

To set good boundaries:
- List the main features your robot must have
- Identify "nice-to-have" features that aren't essential
- Decide what your robot definitely won't do
- Consider your time, budget, and skill limitations

For example, if you're creating a plant-watering robot, you might decide it will:
- Must: Detect soil moisture and water plants when needed
- Must: Work with at least three different plant types
- Nice-to-have: Send alerts when water reservoir is low
- Won't do: Prune plants or add fertilizer

Write down your boundaries and refer to them often. When new ideas come up, ask yourself: "Does this fit within my project boundaries?" If not, save the idea for a future project.

## **Activity 1: Guided Design Workshop**

Complete the structured design template that walks you through defining your problem, sketching initial designs, identifying input-processing-output components, and developing a basic project plan.

## **Research and Background**

Before diving into building your robot, it's important to learn what others have already discovered. Good research helps you avoid repeating mistakes and lets you build on existing knowledge.

Research is like exploring a map before starting a journey. It helps you find the best path forward and avoid dead ends. For your robotics project, research will help you understand the problem better and discover possible solutions that others have tried.

Taking time to research now will save you time and frustration later. It might even inspire new ideas you hadn't thought of before!

### **Finding Relevant Information**

Finding good information is like being a detective - you need to know where to look and how to tell if what you find is trustworthy.

Here are some places to find information for your robotics project:
- Books and textbooks about robotics and your specific problem area
- Websites of robotics companies and educational institutions
- Online forums where robotics enthusiasts share ideas
- Video tutorials and demonstrations
- Scientific articles (ask your teacher to help you find age-appropriate ones)

When evaluating information, ask these questions:
- Who created this information? Are they experts?
- When was it published? Is it up-to-date?
- Does it provide evidence for its claims?
- Do multiple sources agree on this information?

Take notes as you research, writing down important facts and where you found them. Create a simple organization system so you can find your notes later when you need them.

### **Analyzing Existing Solutions**

Looking at how others have solved similar problems can give you valuable insights. It's like learning from both the successes and mistakes of others.

To analyze existing solutions:
1. Find products or projects similar to what you want to create
2. List their main features and how they work
3. Identify their strengths - what do they do well?
4. Note their weaknesses - what could be improved?
5. Consider how users interact with these solutions
6. Think about what makes each solution unique

For example, if you're designing a line-following robot, you might examine existing models to see what sensors they use, how they're programmed, and what problems users report.

Remember that your goal isn't to copy existing solutions but to understand them and then create something better or more suitable for your specific problem.

### **Identifying Applicable Technologies**

Choosing the right technologies for your robot is like selecting the right tools for a job. You want technologies that match your project's needs and your own skills.

Consider these factors when identifying technologies:
- **Sensors**: What information does your robot need to gather? (Light, sound, distance, temperature, etc.)
- **Actuators**: How will your robot interact with the world? (Motors, speakers, lights, etc.)
- **Processing**: What kind of "brain" does your robot need? (Microcontroller, computer, etc.)
- **Power**: How will your robot get energy? (Batteries, solar, plug-in, etc.)
- **Materials**: What should your robot be made of? (Plastic, metal, fabric, etc.)

For each technology you consider, ask:
- Is it appropriate for my project's requirements?
- Is it within my budget and available to me?
- Do I have or can I learn the skills needed to use it?
- Is it reliable and durable enough?

Make a list of the technologies you think will work best for your project, but stay flexible. As you develop your design, you might need to adjust your technology choices.

## **Initial Design Development**

Now it's time to turn your ideas into actual designs! This is where your robot starts to take shape, even if only on paper at first.

Initial designs don't need to be perfect - they're a starting point that will evolve as you learn more. Think of them as rough drafts that help you explore possibilities and communicate your ideas to others.

The best designs often come from trying multiple approaches and combining the best parts of each. Don't be afraid to create several different designs before deciding which direction to take.

### **Sketching and Visualization**

Drawing your ideas is one of the fastest ways to develop and communicate them. You don't need to be an artist - even simple sketches can be very helpful.

Effective sketching techniques include:
- Use simple shapes and lines to represent your robot's main parts
- Label important components and features
- Draw your robot from multiple angles (top, side, front)
- Use arrows to show movement or information flow
- Include a human figure or familiar object for scale
- Add notes explaining how things work

Beyond paper sketches, you might try:
- Digital drawing tools or simple CAD programs
- Building quick models with cardboard, clay, or building blocks
- Creating storyboards that show your robot in action
- Making collages from pictures of existing robots or components

Remember that the goal of visualization is to make your ideas clearer - both to yourself and to others who might help you with your project.

### **Applying the Input-Processing-Output Framework**

The **input-processing-output (IPO) framework** helps you organize your robot's functions in a logical way. It's like describing how your robot's "senses," "brain," and "actions" work together.

**Input (Senses)**:
- What information does your robot need to collect?
- What sensors will gather this information?
- How often does this information need to be updated?

**Processing (Brain)**:
- What decisions does your robot need to make?
- What algorithms or rules will guide these decisions?
- How will your robot store and use information?

**Output (Actions)**:
- What actions will your robot take?
- What motors, lights, sounds, or displays will it use?
- How will these outputs affect the environment?

For example, a line-following robot might have:
- Input: Light sensors to detect the line
- Processing: Algorithm to determine if the robot is on the line and which way to turn
- Output: Motors that adjust speed and direction to stay on the line

Let's look at another real-world example: a digital thermometer used by doctors and nurses. It has:
- Input: Temperature sensor that touches your skin
- Processing: Tiny computer chip that converts the sensor reading into a temperature number
- Output: Display screen that shows your temperature and maybe a beep when it's done

Create a diagram showing how information flows through your robot from input to processing to output. This will help you ensure all necessary components are included in your design.

### **Materials and Components Selection**

Choosing the right materials and components is crucial for your robot's success. Different materials have different properties that make them suitable for specific purposes.

Consider these factors when selecting materials:
- Strength: Does it need to support weight or withstand force?
- Weight: Does your robot need to be light for movement or heavy for stability?
- Flexibility: Does it need to bend or should it be rigid?
- Durability: How long does it need to last?
- Appearance: Is how it looks important for your project?
- Cost: Is it within your budget?
- Availability: Can you get it easily?

For electronic components, consider:
- Compatibility: Will it work with your other components?
- Power requirements: Does it need more energy than you can provide?
- Size and weight: Will it fit in your design?
- Programmability: Can you control it as needed?
- Reliability: Is it known to work consistently?

Create a list of all materials and components you'll need, including quantities and possible sources. This will become your shopping list as you move forward with your project.

---checkyourunderstanding---
When applying the input-processing-output framework to your robotics project, which of the following would be classified as PROCESSING?

A. A touch sensor detecting when an object is grasped

B. A motor turning wheels to move the robot forward

C. An algorithm determining how to navigate around obstacles

D. A light that turns on when a task is completed
---answer---
The correct answer is C. An algorithm determining how to navigate around obstacles. The processing component involves the decision-making algorithms and logic that determine the robot's behavior based on inputs. If you chose a different answer, remember that the touch sensor is an input device that gathers information, while the motor and light are output devices that affect the environment based on the processing decisions.

## **Project Planning Tools**

Good planning is essential for completing your robotics project successfully. Planning tools help you organize your work, track your progress, and make the best use of your time and resources.

Think of project planning like mapping out a journey. You need to know where you're going, what route you'll take, what supplies you'll need, and what challenges you might face along the way.

The right planning tools will help you stay organized and focused, making it more likely that you'll complete your project on time and with good results.

### **Creating a Project Timeline**

A timeline shows what tasks you need to complete and when you'll do them. It helps you manage your time and ensure everything gets done.

To create an effective project timeline:
1. Break your project into smaller tasks (like research, design, building, testing)
2. Estimate how long each task will take
3. Identify which tasks depend on others being completed first
4. Set deadlines for completing each task
5. Include buffer time for unexpected problems
6. Mark important milestones to celebrate progress

You can create a timeline using:
- A simple calendar with tasks written on specific dates
- A Gantt chart (a special bar chart showing tasks over time)
- A digital tool like Trello or a spreadsheet
- A visual timeline drawn on paper

Here's a simple project timeline template you can use:

| Week | Tasks to Complete | Materials Needed | Help Needed |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1    | Research problem, sketch initial designs | Paper, pencils | Feedback from teacher |
| 2    | Finalize design, create materials list | Computer for research | None |
| 3    | Gather materials, start building | Components from list | Help getting materials |
| 4    | Continue building, start programming | Tools, components | Programming help |
| 5    | Test and troubleshoot | Testing equipment | Feedback from peers |
| 6    | Finalize and prepare presentation | Presentation materials | Practice audience |

Review your timeline regularly and adjust it as needed. Remember that most projects take longer than expected, so be realistic about what you can accomplish in the available time.

### **Resource Planning**

Resources are all the things you need to complete your project, including materials, tools, workspace, time, and help from others.

Effective resource planning involves:
- Creating a detailed list of all needed materials and components
- Identifying what tools you'll need and where to get them
- Figuring out where you'll work on your project
- Determining if you need help from others with specific skills
- Calculating the total cost and comparing it to your budget
- Planning how to get resources you don't already have

Create a resource spreadsheet or list with columns for:
- Item name
- Quantity needed
- Where to get it
- Cost
- When you need it
- Alternatives if your first choice isn't available

Good resource planning helps prevent delays caused by missing materials and ensures you have everything you need when you need it.

### **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

Every project faces potential problems or risks. **Risk assessment** helps you identify these challenges in advance, while **mitigation** means planning how to prevent or handle them.

Common risks in robotics projects include:
- Technical problems (components not working together)
- Time constraints (running out of time before completion)
- Resource limitations (not having needed materials or skills)
- Design flaws (discovering your approach doesn't work)
- Safety concerns (potential for injury during building or use)

For each risk you identify:
1. Rate how likely it is to happen (low, medium, high)
2. Rate how serious it would be if it happened
3. Develop a plan to prevent it if possible
4. Create a backup plan for what to do if it happens anyway

For example, if there's a risk of running out of time, you might prevent this by starting early and setting interim deadlines. Your backup plan might be to simplify your design if you fall behind schedule.

Document your risks and plans in a simple risk register that you can refer to throughout your project.

## **Activity 2: Peer Design Review**

Present your initial project plans to a small group of peers who will provide structured feedback using the provided review guide. Focus on gathering insights about the feasibility of your design, clarity of your problem statement, and alignment with project requirements. Use this feedback to refine your project plan.

## **Ethical Design Considerations**

Ethics in robotics means thinking about how your creation might affect people, society, and the environment. Ethical design ensures your robot does good rather than harm.

Considering ethics isn't just about avoiding problems—it can actually make your robot more useful, trustworthy, and successful. Users are more likely to accept and use robots they believe are designed with their wellbeing in mind.

As a robotics designer, you have the responsibility to think carefully about the potential impacts of your creation, both positive and negative.

### **Safety and Accessibility**

Safety means ensuring your robot won't harm users or bystanders. Accessibility means making your robot usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

Safety considerations include:
- Physical safety: Avoiding sharp edges, pinch points, or unstable structures
- Electrical safety: Proper wiring, insulation, and battery handling
- Operational safety: Emergency stops, predictable behavior, and clear instructions
- Data safety: Protecting any personal information your robot might collect

Accessibility considerations include:
- Physical accessibility: Can people with different abilities interact with your robot?
- Sensory accessibility: Does your robot communicate in ways that work for people with vision or hearing differences?
- Cognitive accessibility: Are instructions and interfaces clear and simple to understand?
- Cultural accessibility: Does your design respect different cultural perspectives?

When designing, ask yourself: "Could this feature cause harm?" and "Who might have trouble using this?" Then adjust your design to address these concerns.

It's also important to think about how you'll communicate safety and privacy information to the people who will use your robot. This might include:
- Creating simple, clear instructions with pictures
- Adding warning labels to any parts that could be dangerous
- Explaining what information your robot collects and why
- Designing an emergency stop button that's easy to find and use
- Testing your robot with different users to make sure they understand how to use it safely

### **Environmental Impact**

Robots, like all technologies, affect the environment through their materials, energy use, and eventual disposal. Considering these impacts early helps you make more sustainable choices.

Environmental considerations include:
- Materials: Can you use recycled or sustainable materials?
- Energy efficiency: How can you minimize power consumption?
- Longevity: Can you design for durability and easy repair?
- End-of-life: Can components be recycled or safely disposed of?
- Operational impact: Will your robot's actions affect the environment?

For example, if you're designing a garden-tending robot, you might choose rechargeable batteries instead of disposable ones, use recycled plastic for non-critical parts, and ensure any chemicals it uses for plants are environmentally friendly.

Even small projects can make environmentally conscious choices. Using materials you already have, designing for disassembly so parts can be reused, and minimizing battery usage are all good practices.
