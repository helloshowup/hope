# Easy Multiple-Choice Question Content from Emerging Robotics Fields

## Soft Robotics
- Soft robots use flexible materials that can bend and stretch
- Soft robots can squeeze through tight spaces and return to their original shape
- Soft robots can wrap around objects and pick up delicate items without damaging them
- Scientists look to animals without hard skeletons for inspiration (octopuses, jellyfish, worms)
- Some soft robots move by inflating and deflating air pockets
- Soft robots are being tested for picking strawberries without bruising them
- Soft robot hands can sense how ripe a fruit is

## Swarm Robotics
- Swarm robotics uses groups of small, basic robots that work together as a team
- Swarm robotics is inspired by ants and bees
- In a robot swarm, each robot follows basic rules and communicates with nearby robots
- Robot swarms have no single leader
- A swarm of small robots could search a disaster area faster than one large robot
- If one robot in a swarm stops working, the others continue the mission
- Robot swarms can help organize and retrieve items in warehouses

## Bio-inspired Robots
