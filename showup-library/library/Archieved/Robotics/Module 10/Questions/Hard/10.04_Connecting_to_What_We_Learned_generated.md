## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- The three main steps of how robots interact with the world:
  - **Input devices** (sensors) - gather information from surroundings
  - **Processing** - robot's "brain" makes decisions based on input
  - **Output devices** - allow robots to take action

## Types of Sensors (Input Devices)
- Light sensors - detect brightness levels
- Distance sensors - measure how far away objects are
- Touch sensors - detect physical contact
- Color sensors - identify different colors
- Sound sensors - detect noise levels
- Temperature sensors - measure heat

## Types of Actuators (Output Devices)
- DC motors - spin wheels for movement
- Servo motors - move to precise positions
- LED lights - provide visual feedback
- Speakers - produce sounds
- LCD displays - show text and numbers

## Power Systems
- Common power sources for robots:
  - Batteries - portable but limited energy storage
  - Wall adapters - continuous power but limited mobility
  - Solar panels - generate electricity from light

## Structural Elements
- Chassis - forms the robot's body and holds components
- Wheels, tracks, and legs - provide different movement capabilities
- Mounting brackets - secure motors, sensors, and other parts
- Materials - plastic, metal, and wood offer different properties

## Basic Programming Structures
- **Sequences** - series of commands that run one after another
- **Loops** - allow repeating actions without rewriting code
  - Count-controlled loops - run a specific number of times
  - Condition-controlled loops - run until something specific happens
- **Conditionals** - let robots make decisions using "if-then-else" logic

## Real-World Examples
- Digital thermometer:
  - Input: temperature sensor
  - Processing: computer chip converts reading
  - Output: digital display shows temperature
- Blood pressure monitor:
  - Input: pressure sensor
  - Processing: circuits analyze pressure changes
  - Output: display shows readings
