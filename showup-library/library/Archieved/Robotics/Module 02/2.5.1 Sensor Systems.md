# 2.5.1 Sensor Systems Scavenger Hunt

## Why Are We Doing This?

Robots depend on **input systems**—their “senses”—to gather information and respond to the world. But these same types of sensors are all around you right now!

In this scavenger hunt, you’ll:

- Discover real-world examples of sensors used in technology
- Connect everyday devices to how robots understand their surroundings
- Practice identifying input systems like a robot engineer

This activity helps you recognize **robot sensor systems** in action and prepares you to design better robots yourself.

## What Is a Sensor System?

A **sensor system** includes:

- A **sensor** (like a camera or button)
- The **thing it detects** (like light, sound, or pressure)
- **How it works**
- **How a robot could use it**

You’ll fill in all of these parts as you complete your sensor catalog.


## How to Complete This Activity

1. **Download the Activity File**

- Click the file named **“2-5 Sensor Scavenger Hunt Activity”**
- Save it to your computer, tablet, or cloud drive

2. **Open and Edit Digitally**

- Use a tool like **Google Docs**, **Microsoft Word**, or a **PDF editor** (like Kami or Acrobat)
- Click into the table and type your answers directly into the file

3. **Find at Least 5 Sensors**

- Look around your home, kitchen, phone, school supplies, etc.
- Fill out the chart for each one:

- **Sensor Type**
- **What It Detects**
- **How It Functions**
- **Possible Robotics Use**

4. **Answer the Reflection Questions**

- At the bottom of the sheet, type your answers in full sentences


## Want Feedback?

Once you're done, you can **ask Bryte AI for help!**

📌 Try one of these prompts:

- “Can you check my sensor scavenger hunt and give feedback?”
- “Which of these sensors would be most useful for a robot?”
- “What robotics job could use these sensors?”

Just upload your completed activity and ask away—Bryte AI is ready to help!


## What You’ll Gain

After this activity, you'll:

- Understand how robots “sense” their world
- Know how to match sensors to robot tasks
- Spot real-world tech that uses the same systems as robots
