<p><strong>Problem-Solving Game - Robot Repair Simulation:</strong> A game where students fix broken virtual robots by finding what part isn't working right. You'll be like a robot doctor! For example, you might see a robot that moves in a weird way, and you'll need to figure out if the problem is with its <strong>eyes</strong> (sensors), <strong>muscles</strong> (motors), <strong>brain</strong> (programming), or <strong>battery</strong> (power) by checking each part one by one.</p>
