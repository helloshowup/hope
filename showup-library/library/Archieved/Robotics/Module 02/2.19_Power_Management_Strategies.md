## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Explain at least three **energy conservation techniques** used in robotics
- Compare different **power monitoring systems** and their functions in robots
- Design a **power management solution** for a robot with specific operational requirements

## **Energy Conservation Techniques**

Just having power isn't enough - robots need to use their energy wisely. **Power management strategies** help robots work longer between charges, just like how we try to make our phone batteries last all day.

Robots use several smart ways to save power, similar to how we turn off lights when leaving a room:

**Sleep modes** let robots temporarily shut down parts they don't need right now. Think of a security robot that might turn off its wheels while standing guard, but keep its cameras on to watch for trouble.

**Dynamic power scaling** changes how much power parts use based on what the robot is doing. When a robot is doing something easy, it can use less power (like dimming a light). When it needs to do something hard, it can use more power.

**Efficient motion planning** helps robots move using the least amount of energy. Instead of always taking the shortest path, a robot might avoid hills or bumpy ground that would drain its battery faster. Some robots also use momentum - like rolling downhill - to save energy.

By using these techniques together, robots can work much longer between charges, making them more useful in the real world.

## **Power Monitoring Systems**

Smart robots keep track of their power usage to make better decisions:

**Battery management systems** constantly check the battery's charge level, temperature, and health. This is like having a fuel gauge that tells you not just how much gas is left, but also if there's something wrong with your car's engine.

**Power prediction algorithms** help robots guess how much energy they'll need later. For example, a delivery robot might figure out if it has enough battery to deliver all its packages before needing to recharge.

**Energy-aware decision making** lets robots change what they're doing based on how much power they have left. When a robot's battery gets low, it might only do the most important jobs, slow down to save energy, or find the nearest charging station.

These monitoring systems help robots work more reliably and avoid getting stuck with dead batteries.

## **Charging and Maintenance**

Keeping robot power systems in good shape is important:

**Charging systems** for robots range from simple plug-in stations to cool automatic docking stations. Some robots can find their charging stations by themselves when their batteries run low. Newer charging systems include wireless charging pads that robots can just park on top of to recharge.

**Battery maintenance** helps keep robots running well over time. This includes charging them properly, keeping them out of very hot or cold places, and sometimes doing special charging routines to keep the batteries healthy.

**Maximizing power source lifespan** means taking good care of batteries. For example, some batteries last longer if they're kept between 20% and 80% charged instead of always charging to 100%. Smart robots can follow these rules automatically.

Good maintenance not only helps robots run longer between charges but also makes their batteries last more years before needing replacement.

## **Key Takeaways**
- Robots use energy-saving techniques like **sleep modes**, **power scaling**, and **smart movement paths** to make their batteries last longer.
- **Power monitoring systems** help robots track battery levels and make smart decisions about when to complete tasks or find a charging station.
- Regular **battery maintenance** and proper charging habits extend a robot's operating time and overall battery life.

## **Activity 2: Power Planning Challenge**

Design power solutions for robots with specific operational requirements. Choose one scenario: (1) An **agricultural robot** operating 12-hour shifts in varying weather, (2) A **hospital assistant robot** needing continuous operation, or (3) A **search-and-rescue robot** for disaster zones. Select appropriate power sources, justify your choices, and explain how your design addresses the specific constraints of your chosen scenario.
