**Problem-Solving Game - Robot Repair Simulation:** A game where students fix broken virtual robots by finding what part isn't working right. You'll be like a robot doctor! For example, you might see a robot that moves in a weird way, and you'll need to figure out if the problem is with its **eyes** (sensors), **muscles** (motors), **brain** (programming), or **battery** (power) by checking each part one by one.
