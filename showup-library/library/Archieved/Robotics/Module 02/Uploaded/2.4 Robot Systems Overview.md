# **2.4 Robot Systems Overview**

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

* Explain how robots function using the input-processing-output model  
* Identify the five main components of robot systems and their functions  
* Compare robot systems to equivalent human body systems

Robot systems combine all the concepts we've discussed into machines that can sense, think, and act in their environment. What makes robots special compared to other technology systems is their ability to perform physical actions in the world based on the information they gather.  
   
Robot systems typically include:  
   
**A physical body or structure** that houses all components and allows the robot to exist in the physical world

1. **Input systems** with various sensors that gather information:  
* Vision systems (cameras)  
* Audio systems (microphones)  
* Touch and collision detection  
* Distance measurement  
* Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.)

**Processing systems** that make decisions:

* Microcontrollers or computers  
* Software and algorithms  
* Memory for storing information  
* Communication systems for connecting with other devices

**Output systems** that take action:

* Movement systems (motors, wheels, legs, arms)  
* Manipulation systems (grippers, tools)  
* Communication systems (screens, lights, speakers)

**Power systems** that provide energy:

* Batteries  
* Solar panels  
* Power management circuits

Different types of robots emphasize different aspects of these systems. For example, industrial robot arms focus on precise movement outputs, while social robots emphasize communication inputs and outputs. Autonomous vehicles need sophisticated sensor inputs and processing to navigate safely.  
   
Understanding robots as systems helps us design better robots and use them more effectively to solve problems and improve our lives.

### **Real-World Robot Examples**

Let's look at how the input-processing-output model works in different types of robots:  
**Remote-Controlled Toy Car vs. Autonomous Toy Robot:**  
   
Remote-Controlled Car:

* Inputs: Radio signals from the remote control  
* Processing: Simple circuits that convert signals to motor commands  
* Outputs: Motors that turn wheels, maybe lights or sounds  
   

Autonomous Toy Robot:

* Inputs: Light sensors, bump sensors, maybe a simple camera  
* Processing: A small computer that makes decisions based on sensor data  
* Outputs: Motors for movement, speakers for sounds, lights for communication

The key difference is that the remote-controlled car relies on a human for all decisions, while the autonomous robot makes its own decisions based on what it senses.

**Service Robot (like a hotel delivery robot):**

* Inputs: Cameras to see hallways, sensors to detect obstacles, touchscreen for human input  
* Processing: Maps of the hotel, programs to navigate hallways and avoid people  
* Outputs: Wheel motors for movement, compartment that opens to deliver items, screen and speaker to communicate with guests

**Industrial Robot Arm:**

* Inputs: Precise position sensors, vision systems to identify parts, signals from the factory control system  
* Processing: Complex calculations for movement paths, quality control checks  
* Outputs: Powerful motors that move with extreme precision, grippers that handle parts, status lights

**Autonomous Vehicle:**

* Inputs: Many cameras, radar, lidar (laser sensors), GPS location  
* Processing: Powerful computers running artificial intelligence to recognize roads, signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles  
* Outputs: Control systems for steering, acceleration, and braking; displays and sounds to communicate with passengers

Each of these robots uses the same basic input-processing-output model, but with different types of components based on what job they need to do\!

**CHECKPOINT:** Consider how inputs and outputs might differ between a robot vacuum cleaner and a robot used in space exploration. What unique challenges might each environment present to a robot's systems?
