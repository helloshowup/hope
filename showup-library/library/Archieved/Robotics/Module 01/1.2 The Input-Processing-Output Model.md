# **The Input-Processing-Output Model**

### **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Identify the different types of sensors robots use to gather information from their environment
- Explain how a robot's processing system works to make decisions based on sensor data
- Describe how actuators allow robots to take action and respond to their surroundings

### **Input: How Robots Sense**

Robots use **sensors** to gather information about their environment—this is the "input" part of our model. Sensors function like the robot's eyes, ears, and sense of touch, allowing it to perceive the world around it.

Robots use many types of sensors:

- **Light sensors** detect brightness levels, colors, or even take pictures
- **Sound sensors** pick up noises and voices
- **Touch sensors** detect when something makes physical contact with the robot
- **Distance sensors** measure how far away objects are
- **Temperature sensors** detect heat levels
- **Motion sensors** detect nearby movement

For example, a robot vacuum uses sensors to detect walls and furniture to avoid bumping into them. It might also have sensors to spot particularly dirty areas of your floor that need extra cleaning. Without these sensors, the robot would be "blind" and unable to navigate effectively.

The quality and variety of sensors a robot has determine how much information it can gather about its world—similar to how having both eyes and ears gives you more information than having just one sense.

**CHECKPOINT:** Why do you think robots need sensors to interact with their environment? Think about how humans use their own senses to understand the world around them.

### **Processing: How Robots Think**

Once a robot collects information through its sensors, it needs to make sense of that data and decide what to do. This is the "processing" part of our model—essentially the robot's brain.

The **processing system** in a robot typically consists of a computer or microcontroller running software. This software contains instructions that tell the robot how to interpret sensor data and what actions to take in different situations.

For example, when a robot vacuum's sensors detect a wall, its processing system:

1. Recognizes the sensor data as indicating an obstacle
2. Calculates a new path to avoid the obstacle
3. Decides which direction to turn
4. Sends commands to its motors to execute the turn

Some robots have simple processing systems that follow basic if-then rules: "If sensor detects obstacle, then turn right." Others use sophisticated **artificial intelligence** that can learn from experience and adapt to new situations.

The processing capability gives robots their "smarts" and allows them to make decisions without human intervention. Without this thinking ability, a machine would just be a remote-controlled device following direct human commands.

### **Output: How Robots Act**

After sensing and processing, robots need to do something—this is the "output" part of our model. Robots act on their environment through devices called **actuators**, which convert electrical energy into physical movement or other actions.

Common types of actuators include:

- **Motors** that spin wheels, move arms, or turn gears
- **Speakers** that produce sounds or speech
- **Lights** that provide visual signals
- **Grippers** that can grab and manipulate objects
- **Pumps** that can move liquids or air

For instance, a drone robot uses motor actuators to spin its propellers at different speeds, allowing it to fly in various directions. A robot designed to help elderly people might use speaker actuators to provide verbal reminders about medications.

The actions a robot can perform determine its usefulness for specific tasks. A robot with precise arm movements might be perfect for surgery but useless for vacuuming floors. The combination of sensing, thinking, and acting capabilities defines what jobs a robot can handle effectively.

## Key Takeaways
- Robots use sensors (like light, sound, touch, and distance sensors) as their "eyes and ears" to understand the world around them.
- The processing system acts as the robot's "brain," using software to interpret data and decide what to do next.
- Actuators (such as motors, speakers, and lights) are the robot's "muscles" that allow it to move and interact with its environment.
