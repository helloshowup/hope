<h2>Output Components: How Robots Act</h2>
<p>Once a robot has sensed its environment and decided what to do, it needs ways to take action. <strong>Output components</strong> allow robots to move, manipulate objects, and communicate with the world around them. These are the parts that let robots actually do useful work!</p>
<h3>Motors and Movement</h3>
<p><strong>Motors</strong> are the muscles of a robot, converting electrical energy into movement. Different types of motors serve different purposes in robotics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC motors</strong> provide continuous rotation and are often used in wheels for robot vehicles</li>
<li><strong>Servo motors</strong> can move to precise positions and hold there, making them perfect for robot arms and joints</li>
<li><strong>Stepper motors</strong> move in small, exact steps and are used when very precise movement is needed</li>
</ul>
<p>The way motors are arranged determines how a robot moves. Wheeled robots typically use two or more motors connected to wheels, allowing them to drive forward, backward, and turn. Walking robots use multiple motors to control leg joints, creating more complex but versatile movement. Some robots use tracks (like a tank), propellers (for underwater or flying robots), or even special wheels that can climb stairs.</p>
<p>Motors don't work alone - they need mechanical parts like gears, belts, and linkages to transfer their power effectively. Gears can increase a motor's strength (torque) or speed, while linkages can convert rotational motion into other types of movement.</p>
<h3>Grippers and Manipulators</h3>
<p>For robots that need to interact with objects, <strong>grippers</strong> and <strong>manipulators</strong> serve as hands. These end effectors come in many designs based on what the robot needs to handle. Some use simple pincer-like grippers with two opposing "fingers" that can open and close. Others have multiple fingers that can wrap around objects of different shapes.</p>
<p>Specialized grippers might use suction cups to pick up smooth objects, magnets for metal items, or soft, flexible materials for handling delicate objects. The most advanced robot hands can mimic human dexterity, with multiple joints in each finger and pressure sensors to control grip strength.</p>
<p><strong>Robot arms</strong> connect these grippers to the robot's body and provide the range of motion needed to reach objects. Like human arms, robot arms typically have multiple joints (called axes) that allow them to move in different directions. Industrial robot arms often have six or more axes, giving them the flexibility to reach almost any position within their workspace.</p>

            <p><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Think about the robots you've seen in movies, at home, or in stores. What kinds of movements have you observed them making, and what types of motors might be powering those movements?</p>
        </div>

<h3>Other Action Components</h3>
<p>Robots communicate and interact with their environment through more than just movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speakers</strong> allow robots to produce sounds and speech, helping them communicate with humans</li>
<li><strong>Lights</strong> can signal a robot's status or intentions - for example, a red light might indicate low battery, while a green light shows the robot is ready for a command</li>
<li><strong>Displays</strong> like screens can show more detailed information, including text, images, or even facial expressions for social robots</li>
</ul>
<p>Some robots use specialized output devices like printers, water pumps, or heating elements depending on their specific tasks.</p>
<p>Even simple indicators like buzzers or vibration motors can be important output components, alerting users to important information or providing feedback when the robot completes a task.</p>
<h2>Activity 2: Design Your Robot</h2>
<p>Sketch a simple robot designed for a specific task of your choosing (like cleaning your room, helping in a hospital, or exploring Mars). Label each component according to whether it serves as input (sensing), processing (thinking), or output (acting). For each component, write a brief note explaining why it's necessary for your robot's intended purpose. This exercise will help you apply the input-processing-output framework to practical robot design.</p>
