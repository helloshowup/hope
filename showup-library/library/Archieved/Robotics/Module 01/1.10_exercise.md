I'll create a simple markdown template for the "Design Your Robot" activity that students can fill out. This template will help them organize their thoughts about their robot's components according to the input-processing-output framework.

# Design Your Robot - Activity Worksheet

## Step 1: Choose Your Robot's Purpose
My robot is designed to: _______________________________________

## Step 2: Sketch Your Robot
[Draw your robot in the space below or on a separate sheet of paper]

## Step 3: Identify and Explain Components

### INPUT Components (Sensing)
| Component | Purpose | Why it's necessary |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### PROCESSING Components (Thinking)
| Component | Purpose | Why it's necessary |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### OUTPUT Components (Acting)
| Component | Purpose | Why it's necessary |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| | | |

| | | |

## Step 4: Reflection
How does your robot use the input-processing-output model to accomplish its task?

This template provides a clear structure for students to document their robot design while reinforcing the input-processing-output framework from the lesson. It's simple enough to be converted to a PDF for students to download and complete.
