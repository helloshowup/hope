Which component of the input-processing-output model allows a robot to make decisions based on information from its environment? 

A. Input 

B. Processing 

C. Output 

D. Actuators 
---answer---
The correct answer is B. Processing. The processing component (the robot's "brain") is what allows a robot to make decisions based on the information gathered by its sensors. Input refers to how robots gather information through sensors, and output refers to how robots act through actuators. Actuators are specifically output devices that allow robots to take physical action, but they don't make decisions. If you selected a different answer, review the three parts of the input-processing-output model that define a robot.
