# 1.10.4 Activity 2 (Completed example to help you get started): 

### My Robot Design

**Robot Name**: CleanBot 2000  
**Task/Purpose:** Cleaning bedroom floors  
Sketch:

## Component List

### INPUT Components (Sensing)

| Component | Purpose (what it does) | Why my robot needs it |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Infrared distance sensors | Spots walls and furniture | Stops my robot from crashing into stuff |
| Dirt sensors | Finds the really dirty spots | Makes sure it spends extra time there |

### PROCESSING Components (Thinking)

| Component | Purpose (what it does) | Why my robot needs it |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Microcontroller | Thinks about the sensor info | Decides where to drive and when to turn the brush on |

### OUTPUT Components (Acting)

| Component | Purpose (what it does) | Why my robot needs it |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Wheel motors | Roll the robot around the room | Let it reach every corner of the floor |
| Rotating brush | Sweep dirt into the bin | Actually gets the floor clean |


### Step 4: Reflection

**How does my robot use input-processing-output to do its job?** My robot uses sensors (input) to spot walls and find dirty spots on the floor. Then the microcontroller (processing) thinks about that info and decides where to go and how fast to spin the brush. Finally, the motors and brush (output) make it move and clean the floor.

**What problems might it have and how can I fix them?**

**It might miss stuff** if shiny furniture confuses the sensors. I could fix that by adding bumpers or a tiny camera.

**It might get stuck** under couches or in corners. I’d add a height sensor or make it back up automatically.

**The battery might run out** before it’s done. I could give it a bigger battery or make it drive back to charge.

**Hair could jam the brush**, so I’d design it so you can pop it off and clean it easily.
