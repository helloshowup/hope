    <h1 style="color: #920205;">2.4.1 Hands-On Activity: Human vs. Robot Systems</h1>
<p>Now that you've explored how robots function as systems, it's time to connect what you've learned to something you're already familiar with—your own body!</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>Xxx</p>
<h3>Why We're Doing This</h3>
<p>Robots and humans have a lot in common when it comes to how we sense, think, and act. This activity will help you compare <strong>human body systems</strong> to <strong>robot components</strong>, so you can see how robots mimic (or differ from) the way people work.</p>
<h3>Instructions: Complete the Comparison Chart</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Open the Chart</strong>
   - Download or open the <strong>"Human vs. Robot Systems Comparison Chart"</strong> (linked above or in your course materials).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Look at Each Human System</strong>
   - You'll see body systems like the <strong>skeletal system</strong>, <strong>nervous system</strong>, <strong>digestive system</strong>, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match to Robot Systems</strong>
   - For each one, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does this body system do for humans?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What kind of robot system does the same job?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What parts or components help robots do that?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Where do you see this in real-world robots?</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use What You've Learned</strong>
   - Refer to your lesson notes about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input systems</strong> (sensors like cameras or bump sensors)</li>
<li><strong>Processing systems</strong> (microcontrollers and programs)</li>
<li><strong>Output systems</strong> (motors, grippers, screens)</li>
<li><strong>Power systems</strong> (batteries, solar panels)</li>
<li>Use the robot examples from earlier (like the delivery robot, industrial arm, or toy robot) to help fill in the "real robot" column.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write Simply and Clearly</strong>
   - Use short, clear phrases. Bullet points are okay!
   - Use your own words—don't just copy from the lesson.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p><strong>Human System:</strong> <em>Nervous System</em> <br />
<strong>Robot Function:</strong> Processes information and makes decisions <br />
<strong>Robot Components:</strong> Microcontroller, software, memory <br />
<strong>Real Robot Example:</strong> Industrial robot arm calculating movement path</p>
<h3>Reflection Time</h3>
<p>After filling out the chart, read the reflection questions at the bottom of the page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about what's hard for robots to copy from humans.</li>
<li>Imagine what cool systems robots could have that humans don't!</li>
<li>Jot down your answers in full sentences.</li>
</ul>
<h3>You're Done When:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every row in the chart has something written in each column.</li>
<li>You've answered all 4 reflection questions thoughtfully.</li>
</ul>
