<h1>Industrial Revolution in Robotics</h1>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the historical development of industrial robots from the 1960s to present and their impact on manufacturing.</li>
<li>Identify at least three different applications of robots in modern workplaces beyond factories.</li>
<li>Apply the input-processing-output model to explain how a specific robotic system works.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industrial Revolution in Robotics</h2>
<p>The introduction of robots into factories created a second industrial revolution beginning in the 1960s. Before robots, manufacturing required armies of workers performing repetitive, often dangerous tasks. Building on the development of the first programmable robots we discussed in Lesson 1.6, industrial applications quickly transformed manufacturing worldwide.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, robots transformed manufacturing around the world, especially in the automotive industry. Japan became a leader in industrial robotics, with companies like FANUC and Kawasaki developing increasingly sophisticated robot arms that could weld, paint, and assemble products. By the 1990s, it was impossible to build a car without robots handling many of the manufacturing steps.</p>
<p>This robotics revolution dramatically increased productivity and product quality while reducing costs. A modern car factory might have hundreds of robots working together, each specialized for specific tasks like welding, painting, or installing windshields. These industrial robots have completely changed how products are made and have created new types of jobs focused on programming and maintaining these mechanical workers.</p>
<h2>Factory Automation</h2>
<p>By the 1980s, industrial robots became more sophisticated and could work together in coordinated systems. In auto manufacturing plants, rows of robot arms would pass car bodies from one station to the next, with each robot performing a specific task. These robots could lift heavy objects, work in environments with toxic chemicals, and perform precise movements that would be difficult for human hands.</p>
<p>Today's factory robots can "see" using computer vision systems, adjust their movements based on what they detect, and even work safely alongside human workers. Modern collaborative robots (or "cobots") have sensors that detect when people are nearby, allowing them to slow down or stop to prevent accidents. This has allowed robots to move beyond dangerous or repetitive tasks to become true partners in the manufacturing process.</p>
<h2>Robots Enter the Workplace</h2>
<p>Robots aren't just for factories anymore! Since the 2000s, robots have moved into many different workplaces, taking on jobs that were once done only by humans. In warehouses, robots like Amazon's Kiva systems move shelves of products to human packers, helping workers fill orders faster. In hospitals, robot carts deliver medications and supplies throughout the building, and robot surgical systems help doctors perform operations with incredible precision.</p>
<p>Even restaurants have started using robots! Some sushi restaurants use robot systems to prepare rice and assemble simple dishes. In hotels, robot bellhops can deliver items to guest rooms, and cleaning robots vacuum hallways and public areas. These workplace robots don't usually look like humans—they're designed specifically for the jobs they need to do.</p>
<p>The expansion of robots into different workplaces has changed many jobs. While some worry that robots will replace human workers, history has shown that robots often take over the most repetitive or dangerous parts of jobs, allowing humans to focus on tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and personal interaction—things robots still aren't very good at!</p>
<p>Let's look at a smart home device like a voice assistant (such as Amazon Echo or Google Home) using our input-processing-output model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: Microphones listen for voice commands</li>
<li><strong>Processing</strong>: Computer chips analyze what you said and decide how to respond</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong>: Speakers play back answers or control other devices in your home</li>
</ul>
<p>This example shows how robots have become part of our everyday lives, not just in factories or science labs. Even though a voice assistant doesn't move around like robots in movies, it still fits our definition because it senses, processes, and acts on its environment.</p>
