<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A step-by-step set of instructions that solves a problem or completes a task.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Following a recipe to make cookies is an algorithm - you follow specific steps in order to get delicious cookies at the end!</p>
<h2>Block-based programming</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A way to code using visual puzzle-like pieces that snap together instead of typing text.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  In Scratch or LEGO MINDSTORMS, you drag and connect colorful blocks to make your robot move or play sounds.</p>
<h2>Bug</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A mistake or error in a program that makes it work incorrectly or crash.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If your robot turns right when you told it to turn left, your program has a bug that needs fixing.</p>
<h2>Conditional</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A programming statement that makes decisions using if-then logic.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  IF the robot's touch sensor is pressed, THEN make the robot stop and back up.</p>
<h2>Control structure</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Code that determines the order in which instructions run, like sequences, loops, and conditionals.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Using a loop to make your robot drive in a square by repeating 'move forward, turn right' four times.</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong>  "dee-BUG-ing"</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The process of finding and fixing errors in a program.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When your robot keeps crashing into walls, you debug by checking your distance sensor code.</p>
<h2>Decomposition</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Breaking a complex problem into smaller, simpler parts that are easier to solve.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Instead of programming 'clean the room' all at once, you break it into 'pick up toys', 'vacuum floor', etc.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Creating a 'make_square' function that your robot can use whenever it needs to drive in a square pattern.</p>
<h2>Graceful degradation</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A robot's ability to keep working when parts of its system fail, just with reduced capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  If a robot's camera stops working, it can still navigate using touch sensors instead of giving up completely.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Information that goes into a computer or robot, like sensor readings or button presses.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When you press buttons on a game controller, you're providing input that tells the game what to do.</p>
<h2>Input-Processing-Output (IPO) model</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A three-step pattern where robots take in information, think about it, then act on it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A smart thermostat takes in room temperature (input), decides if it's too hot (processing), then turns on AC (output).</p>
<h2>Logic error</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A mistake in a program that makes it run but produce incorrect results.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your robot follows all instructions but turns left when it should turn right because you mixed up directions.</p>
<h2>Logical operator</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Special words (AND, OR, NOT) that combine or flip conditions in programming decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  IF the robot sees a red light AND hears a beep, THEN it should stop moving.</p>
<h2>Loop</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A control structure that repeats a set of instructions multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Using a loop to make your robot blink its lights 10 times without writing the same code over and over.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The result or action produced by a computer or robot, like movement, sounds, or displays.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When your robot beeps and flashes lights after completing a task, those are outputs.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The thinking part where a robot makes decisions based on input information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When your robot compares the distance sensor reading to decide whether to stop or keep moving.</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Creating instructions that tell a computer or robot exactly what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Writing code to make your robot follow a line on the floor or avoid obstacles.</p>
<h2>Programming language</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A special language with rules that lets humans communicate instructions to computers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Scratch uses colorful blocks, while Python uses text commands to tell computers what to do.</p>
<h2>Runtime error</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A problem that happens while a program is running, causing it to crash or stop.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Your robot program crashes when it tries to divide by zero or access a sensor that isn't connected.</p>
<h2>Sensor</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A device that detects changes in the environment and sends this information to the robot.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A light sensor helps your robot follow a line by detecting the difference between light and dark surfaces.</p>
<h2>Sensor fusion</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Combining data from multiple sensors to get more reliable information.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A robot vacuum uses bumper sensors, cliff sensors, and cameras together to navigate safely around your home.</p>
<h2>Sequence</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Instructions that run in a specific order, one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  To make a sandwich, you follow a sequence: get bread, add peanut butter, add jelly, put slices together.</p>
<h2>Syntax error</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A mistake in how code is written that breaks the rules of the programming language.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Forgetting to close a bracket or misspelling a command will cause a syntax error.</p>
<h2>Threshold</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A specific value that triggers a change in a robot's behavior when crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  When light sensor reading goes below 30, the robot knows it's on the black line and should follow it.</p>
<h2>Variable</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  A container that stores information in a program that might change while the program runs.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  A score variable in a game keeps track of your points as you play and collect more.</p>
