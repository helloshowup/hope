# 6.10.4 Design Iteration and Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Apply design iteration principles to make targeted improvements to your robot
- Create a prioritization plan for robot design changes using the impact/effort matrix
- Verify that your robot meets requirements and validate its performance in real-world conditions

## Design Iteration Principles

After testing your robot and identifying problems, the next exciting step is making improvements. This isn't about starting over—it's about refining what you've already built. The best engineers know that great designs rarely happen on the first try. Instead, they evolve through a series of thoughtful adjustments based on real-world testing. Let's explore how to make your robot better through careful iteration.

Now that we've identified problems through testing, let's look at how to make improvements in a systematic way.

### Making Targeted Improvements

When you make targeted improvements, you change specific parts of your design based on test results, rather than starting from scratch. It's more like precise surgery than demolishing and rebuilding a house!

Start by connecting each problem directly to a specific improvement. For example:

- If tests show your robot is too slow, you might upgrade motors or reduce weight
- If battery life is too short, you might add a larger battery or optimize power usage in your code
- If sensors are giving inconsistent readings, you might reposition them or add shielding from interference

Make one change at a time whenever possible. This approach helps you identify which change fixed (or didn't fix) each problem. If you change five things at once and the robot improves, you won't know which change made the difference!

Keep your original design goals in mind when making improvements. Sometimes fixing one problem might create trade-offs with other aspects of performance. For example, adding a bigger battery might improve run time but also make your robot heavier and slower.

### Prioritizing Changes

Not all improvements have equal importance or ease of implementation. Prioritizing helps you focus your time and resources.

A helpful tool is the impact/effort matrix - a simple chart with four sections:

1. High impact, low effort: Do these first! (Quick wins)
2. High impact, high effort: Plan these with care (Major projects)
3. Low impact, low effort: Do if you have time (Easy fixes)
4. Low impact, high effort: Avoid these (Not worth it)

For example, if your garden-monitoring robot keeps getting stuck in mud:

- High impact, low effort: Adding wider wheels (quick win)
- High impact, high effort: Redesigning the entire movement system (major project)
- Low impact, low effort: Making the robot more colorful (easy but not helpful)
- Low impact, high effort: Building a new robot from scratch (not worth it)

Also consider dependencies between changes. Some improvements might need to happen in a specific order. For example, you might need to strengthen your robot's structure before adding heavier components.

Focus on fixing critical flaws before making optional enhancements. If your robot can't complete its basic task, making it look cooler or adding extra features should wait until the core functionality works.

### Documenting Design Evolution

Tracking how your design changes over time provides valuable insights. Create a design log that records:

- What version of the design you're working on (v1, v2, etc.)
- What specific changes you made in each version
- Why you made those changes (which problems they address)
- How the changes affected performance (with test results)
- Any unexpected consequences of the changes

Include photos or diagrams of each version if possible. This visual record makes it easier to see how your design has evolved and might help you identify patterns or issues.

Good documentation also helps if you need to "roll back" to a previous version because a change didn't work as expected. Instead of trying to remember how things were before, you'll have clear records to guide you.

## Verification and Validation

When your robot project nears completion, take time to evaluate whether your creation meets its intended purpose. This final phase goes beyond checking requirements—it ensures your robot works in real-world conditions. Let's explore how to confirm that your robot meets technical specifications and performs well in its intended environment.

This section covers methods for confirming that the improved design meets requirements and performs as expected in realistic conditions.

### Confirming Requirements Are Met

Verification is the process of checking that your robot meets all the specific requirements you established at the beginning of your project. Consider it a checklist to ensure nothing has been forgotten.

Start by reviewing your original design requirements. For each requirement, create a specific test that will verify whether it's been met. For example:

- If a requirement was "robot must be able to navigate around obstacles," your verification test might involve placing objects in the robot's path and confirming it avoids them.
- If a requirement was "robot must operate for at least 30 minutes on a single charge," your verification would involve timing a complete run cycle.

Create a simple verification table with columns for each requirement, the test method, and whether it passed or failed. This gives you a clear picture of which requirements have been satisfied and which still need work.

Remember that verification is objective - a requirement is either met or it isn't. This helps you make clear decisions about whether your robot is ready for real-world use.

### Validating Real-World Performance

Validation goes beyond checking specific requirements to evaluate how well your robot performs its intended function in realistic conditions. While verification asks "Did we build the robot right?", validation asks "Did we build the right robot?"

To validate your robot, test it in environments that match where it will be used. For example:

- If you've built a line-following robot for a competition, practice on courses similar to the competition track
- If you've built a robot to help around the house, test it in rooms with real furniture and obstacles

Validation often reveals unexpected challenges that didn't show up in controlled testing. Maybe your robot works well on smooth surfaces but struggles on carpet, or performs well in bright light but gets confused in shadows.

Collect feedback from potential users if possible. If others will be operating your robot, have them try it out and share their experiences. Their perspective might uncover usability problems you hadn't considered.

### Final Design Documentation

Thorough documentation of your final design serves multiple purposes: it helps others understand your work, allows you to recreate your robot if needed, and provides a foundation for future improvements.

Your final documentation should include:

1. Design overview: A high-level description of what your robot does and how it works
2. Detailed specifications: Dimensions, weight, materials, components used
3. Assembly instructions: Step-by-step guide with diagrams or photos
4. Code documentation: Code with explanations of key functions
5. Performance data: Results from your final tests showing how the robot performs
6. Design history: Brief summary of major changes made during development
7. Known limitations: Honest assessment of any remaining issues or constraints
8. Future improvements: Ideas for how the design could be enhanced further

Make your documentation clear enough that someone with similar skills could understand and recreate your robot. Use simple language, include plenty of visuals, and organize information logically.

Remember that good documentation is valuable even after your project is complete - it might help you or others build on your work in the future!

**CHECKPOINT:** How did your understanding of the problem change through the testing and improvement process? Consider how your perception of what makes an effective solution evolved based on empirical evidence rather than initial assumptions.
