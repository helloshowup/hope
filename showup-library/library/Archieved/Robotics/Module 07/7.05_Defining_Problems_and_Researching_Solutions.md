# Defining Problems and Researching Solutions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Write clear problem statements for robot tasks
- List the key parts of a good problem statement
- Use a simple template to create your own problem statements

## Lesson Podcast Discussion: Crafting Effective Problem Statements

In today's podcast, we explore how well-defined problem statements lead to better robotics solutions. When engineers clearly understand what they're trying to solve, they're much more likely to create effective solutions.

For example, compare these two problem statements:
- Poor: "We need a robot that does stuff in the classroom."
- Good: "We need a robot that can safely navigate around classroom furniture to deliver materials to student groups while operating for at least 2 hours on a single battery charge."

The first statement is vague and provides almost no guidance. The second clearly defines what the robot needs to do, where it will operate, and a specific performance requirement. Teams working with the second statement will have a much clearer direction and can evaluate whether their solutions actually solve the problem.

Well-defined problems save time, reduce frustration, and lead to more successful robotics projects. Throughout this lesson, we'll learn how to craft these clear problem statements and use them to guide our solution development.

## Defining the Problem

Before we can build a robot to solve a problem, we need to understand exactly what that problem is. Imagine trying to build a bridge without knowing what river it needs to cross or what kind of traffic it needs to support! The same applies to robotics - we need a clear picture of the problem before we can design an effective solution.

In robotics, a well-defined problem helps us determine what sensors our robot might need, what actions it should perform, and what success looks like. Without this clarity, we might build something that doesn't actually solve the real issue or misses important requirements.

## Elements of a Strong Problem Statement

A strong problem statement is like a roadmap for your robotics project. It should include several key elements that guide your design process:

First, it needs a clear description of the issue - what's happening that shouldn't be, or what isn't happening that should be? For example, "Students with mobility challenges cannot easily access books from the top shelves in our library."

Second, it should define the scope - what parts of the problem will your solution address, and what parts won't it address? For instance, "Our solution will focus on retrieving books from shelves, not on cataloging or reshelving them."

Third, include measurable success criteria - how will you know if your solution works? For example, "The robot should be able to retrieve a requested book within 2 minutes and deliver it safely to the student."

When these elements come together, they create a clear target for your design efforts and help everyone understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish.

## Problem Statement Template

Now that we understand the key elements, here's a simple template you can use to create your own problem statements:

"The problem is that [describe the issue] affecting [who is affected]. A successful solution would [measurable outcome] while [important constraints]."

For example:
"The problem is that students waste time walking to the recycling bins during class, affecting learning time. A successful solution would reduce classroom interruptions by 50% while keeping recycling properly sorted."

This template helps you organize your thoughts and ensures you cover all the important parts of a good problem statement.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you tried to solve a problem but weren't exactly sure what you needed to fix. Maybe it was building something, fixing a toy, or helping with a project at home. How did not having a clear problem make things harder? How might having a clear problem statement have helped you?

## Key Takeaways
- A good problem statement clearly describes what needs to be fixed, who it affects, and how you'll know your solution works.
- Include specific details about the problem, what your solution will and won't do, and how to measure success.
- Using the template "The problem is that [describe the issue] affecting [who is affected]. A successful solution would [measurable outcome] while [important constraints]" helps you create clear problem statements.
