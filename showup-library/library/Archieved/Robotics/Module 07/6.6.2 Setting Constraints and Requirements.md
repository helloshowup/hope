# 6.6.2 Setting Constraints and Requirements

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Differentiate between constraints and requirements in robot design
- Create a basic constraint map to visualize relationships between design limitations
- Translate stakeholder needs into specific design parameters for a robot

## From Stakeholder Needs to Design Boundaries

Now that we've identified our stakeholders and assessed their needs (as we explored in 6.6.1), we need to translate these insights into practical design parameters. This is where constraints and requirements come into play—they transform stakeholder needs into specific guidelines that will shape our robot design.

## Understanding Constraints

**Constraints** are the limitations your solution must work within. They act as guardrails for your creativity, keeping your ideas practical and achievable. Many constraints emerge from the stakeholder needs we identified in our earlier assessment.

In robot design, you'll encounter several important constraint types:

- **Physical constraints**: Size, weight, or the environment where the robot will operate
- **Technical constraints**: Available power sources, materials, or technology
- **Time constraints**: Deadlines for completion or performance speed requirements
- **Budget constraints**: How much money is available for building and maintaining the robot
- **Safety constraints**: Making sure the robot won't harm people or property

Consider our example from 6.6.1 about a robot for a school cafeteria. The stakeholder needs would translate into constraints such as: must operate with minimal noise during lunch periods, must move safely around students, must be cleanable to food-safety standards, and must fit through standard doorways.

## Establishing Requirements

**Requirements** are the specific things your solution must do or have. While constraints tell you what you can't do, requirements define what your robot must do to meet the needs we identified in our stakeholder analysis.

Requirements should be specific and measurable based on our needs assessment. For example:

- Instead of "the robot should help cafeteria staff" (vague need), specify "the robot must be able to transport up to 20 lunch trays at once" (clear requirement)
- Instead of "the robot should be easy to use" (general need), specify "the robot must be controllable via a touchscreen interface that can be learned in under 15 minutes" (measurable requirement)

Requirements address the "must-haves" identified in our needs assessment, ensuring our design will satisfy what matters most to our stakeholders.

## Constraint Mapping

Constraint mapping is a visual technique to understand how different limitations interact and where your solution space lies. This helps you identify potential conflicts before you start building.

To create a constraint map:
1. List all constraints (budget, time, technology, space, etc.)
2. Draw connections between related constraints
3. Identify which constraints are fixed and which might be flexible
4. Look for the "solution space" where all constraints can be satisfied

For example, if designing a robot arm for a classroom (one of our stakeholder environments from 6.6.1), your constraint map might show relationships like:

- Lower cost ↔ Limited functionality
- Higher weight ↔ More stability but less portability
- More complex design ↔ Higher learning curve for users

The area where all your constraints can be satisfied becomes your "solution space" - the range of possible designs that could work for your situation.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a robot you might design for your school or home. Building on the stakeholders you identified in the previous lesson, what are three constraints it would need to work within? What are two specific requirements it would need to meet?

## Balancing Constraints and Innovation

While constraints might seem limiting, they help focus creativity. Constraints often spark more innovative solutions than unlimited options would.

For example, if your needs assessment revealed budget concerns from your stakeholders, this limitation might lead you to discover clever ways to use everyday materials for your robot. A size constraint based on classroom space might inspire a folding mechanism that makes your robot more versatile.

If you encounter a difficult constraint, consider these questions:

- Is this constraint negotiable, or can it be discussed with stakeholders?
- Can we approach this problem differently to avoid the constraint?
- What if we turned this constraint into an advantage?

Remember that the most impressive robotics solutions often come from working creatively within tight constraints rather than having unlimited resources.

## Key Takeaways

- Constraints set boundaries for your design (like budget, size, or safety limits), while requirements define what your robot must do to meet stakeholder needs.
- Creating a constraint map helps visualize how different limitations interact, revealing your available "solution space" where all constraints can be satisfied.
- Working within constraints often leads to more creative and innovative solutions than having unlimited options.
