## Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

### Define the Problem
- How problem definition affects the design process:
  - Specific definitions provide clearer direction than vague goals
  - Well-defined problems help determine if final solutions are successful
  - Problem statements should include operational conditions and constraints
- Key elements of effective problem statements:
  - Specific tasks the robot must perform
  - Environmental conditions for operation
  - Resource limitations (time, materials, budget)
  - Physical constraints (size, weight, power)

### Research and Ideate
- Relationship between research and ideation:
  - Research informs the brainstorming process
  - Information gathering precedes idea generation
  - Both steps work together to create informed creativity
- Effective research strategies:
  - Analyzing existing solutions to similar problems
  - Investigating appropriate technologies and components
  - Studying the operational environment
  - Gathering user requirements and feedback
- Brainstorming principles:
  - Prioritizing quantity of ideas over immediate quality
  - Considering unusual approaches that might contain useful elements
  - Using sketches and discussions to develop concepts

### Design Solutions
- Evaluation criteria for selecting the best solution:
  - How well each approach addresses the original problem
  - Feasibility with available technology and resources
  - Potential challenges and weaknesses
- Components of comprehensive robot design plans:
  - Mechanical designs showing physical structure
  - Electrical schematics for circuits and connections
  - Programming flowcharts outlining code logic
  - Parts lists documenting required components

### Build and Test
- Relationship between building and testing:
  - Construction must follow design specifications
  - Testing validates whether requirements are met
  - Problems discovered represent valuable information
- Testing methodology considerations:
  - Creating specific tests aligned with original requirements
  - Systematically evaluating different aspects of performance
  - Documenting observations, measurements, and results

### Improve and Iterate
- Effective iteration strategies:
  - Making one change at a time to isolate effects
  - Testing after each modification
  - Documenting all changes and their results
- Types of improvements in robotics:
  - Minor adjustments (repositioning components)
  - Major redesigns (changing fundamental mechanisms)
  - Software modifications (altering control algorithms)
- Decision factors in the iteration process:
  - Balancing performance improvements against resource constraints
  - Determining when requirements have been sufficiently met
  - Recognizing when to continue versus when to conclude iteration

### Process Integration
- How the five steps interconnect:
  - Each step builds upon previous steps
  - The process may require revisiting earlier steps
  - Documentation throughout creates continuity
- Application of the process to different robotics challenges:
  - Navigation and obstacle avoidance
  - Object detection and manipulation
  - Environmental sensing and response
