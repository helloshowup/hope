# Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

## Collaborative Testing Approaches

- How collaborative testing methods can be applied by individuals:
  - Using "fresh eyes" testing to identify overlooked issues
  - Role-playing different perspectives (builder, tester, user)
  - Implementing structured testing protocols

- Testing protocol applications:
  - Function testing: Testing individual components before whole system integration
  - Boundary testing: Examining performance at extreme conditions
  - Failure testing: Creating intentional problems to evaluate robot response

- Documentation requirements for effective testing:
  - Test parameters and methodology
  - Success metrics and observations
  - Problem identification
  - Solution implementation and results

## Documentation and Design Portfolio Development

- Components of an effective design portfolio:
  - Problem statement and requirements analysis
  - Research foundation and precedent examination
  - Design evolution from initial sketches to final plans
  - Construction documentation at various stages
  - Code documentation with explanatory comments
  - Testing data collection and analysis
  - Design iteration based on testing results

- Evidence collection strategies:
  - Comparative documentation ("before and after")
  - Performance recording through video
  - Code version archiving
  - Quantitative data organization in tables
  - Failed design preservation with analysis
  - File organization systems and naming conventions

## Presentation Techniques

- Effective presentation structure:
  - Challenge introduction and contextual relevance
  - Visual aid integration for concept communication
  - Design process narrative development
  - Demonstration planning and execution
  - Learning outcomes and future improvements
  - Organization of key points for audience comprehension

- Presentation delivery considerations:
  - How to balance technical details with storytelling
  - Methods for demonstrating robot functionality
  - Techniques for communicating design decisions and rationale
  - Approaches for explaining testing methodology and results

- Relationship between documentation and presentation:
  - How portfolio elements translate to presentation components
  - Converting technical documentation into accessible explanations
  - Using evidence to support design claims during presentation
