# HARD Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Evaluative Thinking and Critical Analysis
- Evaluation of the effectiveness of different brainstorming methodologies in robotics design
- Analysis of when structured vs. unstructured brainstorming approaches would yield optimal results
- Judgment of trade-offs between collaborative and individual ideation techniques
- Assessment of how cognitive biases might influence the decision matrix process

## Complex Relationships and Systems Thinking
- Interconnections between problem definition, ideation techniques, and evaluation methods
- Relationship between team composition and effectiveness of specific collaborative techniques
- How the integration of diverse perspectives affects the quality of solutions in robotics design
- Systemic analysis of how evaluation criteria selection influences final design outcomes

## Abstract Concepts and Theoretical Frameworks
- Application of divergent vs. convergent thinking principles in robotics ideation
- How biomimicry (nature thinking) represents a cross-disciplinary approach to innovation
- Theoretical underpinnings of "flipping the problem" as a cognitive reframing technique
- Conceptual analysis of how weighted criteria in decision matrices reflect value hierarchies

## Predictive and Hypothetical Scenarios
- Prediction of how different brainstorming approaches might yield different types of robotics solutions
- Hypothetical analysis of how changing the weighting in decision matrices would alter outcomes
- Implications of prioritizing different criteria (feasibility vs. innovation) on long-term project success
- Forecasting potential implementation challenges based on ideation and selection methods

## Meta-Cognitive Analysis
- Critical examination of the limitations of decision matrices in capturing qualitative factors
- Evaluation of how the "Yes, and..." technique might overcome confirmation bias in team settings
- Analysis of when to trust intuitive judgment versus structured evaluation in design selection
- Assessment of how documentation methods during ideation impact knowledge retention and iteration
