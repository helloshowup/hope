  - Evaluating if criteria address both functional and constraint requirements

## Complex Relationships and Implications

- **Problem-Solution Alignment Analysis**
  - Evaluating whether proposed solutions actually address the defined problem
  - Analyzing potential unintended consequences of solution approaches
  - Determining if a solution addresses root causes versus symptoms

- **Systemic Problem Analysis**
  - Identifying interconnected factors that influence problem complexity
