- **Design evolution documentation as knowledge management**
  - How documentation serves as both historical record and predictive tool
  - The relationship between version control and understanding design trajectory
  - The value of documentation in enabling "rollback" decisions versus forward progress

## Verification and Validation
- **Distinction between verification and validation philosophies**
  - How verification ("Did we build the robot right?") differs conceptually from validation ("Did we build the right robot?")
  - The limitations of requirements-based testing in predicting real-world performance
  - The relationship between controlled testing environments and actual operating conditions

- **Comprehensive validation methodologies**
  - How user feedback reveals design assumptions that weren't explicitly tested
