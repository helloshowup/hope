# Easy Multiple-Choice Question Content for Engineering Design Process

## Define the Problem
- The first step in the engineering design process
- Involves clearly identifying what your robot needs to accomplish
- Requires identifying constraints or limitations
- A well-defined problem statement answers specific questions about:
  - What task the robot should perform
  - Conditions for operation
  - Available resources (time, materials, budget)
  - Size, weight, or power limitations
- Example: "I want to build a robot that can detect and pick up small objects from the floor"
- Writing down the problem definition helps keep projects focused

## Research and Ideate
- The second step in the engineering design process
- Involves gathering information about existing solutions
- Includes learning about relevant technologies
- Activities during research include:
  - Looking at how others solved similar problems
  - Learning about sensors, motors, or materials
  - Studying the environment where the robot will operate
- Brainstorming follows research
- The goal is to generate many different possible solutions

## Design Solutions
- The third step in the engineering design process
- Involves evaluating ideas from the previous step
- Requires developing detailed plans for promising solutions
- Typical robot design plans include:
  - Mechanical designs
  - Electrical schematics
  - Programming flowcharts
  - Parts lists

## Build and Test
- The fourth step in the engineering design process
- Involves constructing a prototype based on plans
- Building activities include:
  - Gathering materials and components
  - Assembling the mechanical structure
  - Connecting electronic components
  - Programming the robot's behavior
- Testing determines if the robot meets requirements
- Problems found during testing provide valuable information

## Improve and Iterate
- The fifth and final step in the engineering design process
- Uses test results to improve the design
- Few designs work perfectly the first time
- Involves identifying specific aspects needing improvement
- Requires making one change at a time and testing again
- May involve small adjustments or major redesigns
- Process continues until requirements are met or resources are exhausted
