# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Stakeholders
- People who will be affected by your robotics solution
- Direct users who will interact with the robot
- People who will benefit from the robot's work
- People who might be worried about the robot's operation
- People who will maintain or fix the robot

## Stakeholder Identification Questions
- Who will use the robot?
- Who will benefit from the robot's actions?
- Who might be worried about the robot operating in their space?
- Who will maintain or fix the robot?

## Stakeholder Example
- For a school cafeteria robot, stakeholders include:
  - Students
  - Cafeteria staff
  - Custodians
  - School administrators

## Constraints Definition
- Limitations your solution must work within
- Types of constraints:
  - Physical constraints (size, weight, environment)
  - Technical constraints (power sources, materials, technology)
  - Time constraints (deadlines, performance speed)
  - Budget constraints (money for building and maintaining)
  - Safety constraints (preventing harm to people or property)

## Requirements Definition
- Specific things your solution must do or have
- Examples of requirements:
  - "The robot must be able to climb stairs"
  - "The robot must operate for at least 3 hours on a single charge"
  - "The robot must be controllable by someone with limited hand mobility"

## Root Cause Analysis
- The "5 Whys" technique involves asking "why" repeatedly to dig deeper into a problem
- Helps find the real cause of a problem, not just symptoms

## Needs Assessment Components
- Gathering information from stakeholders
- Distinguishing between "needs" (must-haves) and "wants" (nice-to-haves)
- Prioritizing needs based on importance and impact

## Research Methods
- Finding existing solutions
- Examining commercial products
- Looking at open-source robotics projects
- Reviewing academic research papers
- Studying robotics competition entries

## Expert Consultation
- Potential experts to consult:
  - Teachers with robotics experience
  - Local engineers or programmers
  - College students studying robotics
  - Members of robotics clubs or teams
  - Professionals in related fields
