## Robot Design Challenges

### Challenge Types
- Line-following challenge
- Obstacle course challenge
- Object sorting challenge
- Custom challenge design

### Line-Following Challenge
- A line-following robot tracks and follows a line drawn on the ground
- The robot uses light sensors to "see" the line
- The line is usually black, and the background is usually white
- The robot must stay on the line even when it curves or makes sharp turns
- Success means the robot can follow the entire line without going off course
- This is similar to how self-driving cars follow lane markings

### Obstacle Course Challenge
- Robot must navigate through a path with barriers and terrain changes
- The robot might need to go around walls, climb small ramps, or squeeze through passages
- Robots need distance sensors or touch sensors
- Similar to how robots in warehouses or on other planets move around

### Object Sorting Challenge
- Robots identify different objects and sort them into correct categories
- Example: separating blue blocks from red blocks
- Robots need sensors to detect color, size, or shape
- Robots need a gripper arm or scoop to move objects
- Similar to recycling robots or factory robots

### Custom Challenge Design
- You can create your own robot challenge
- Need to define what problem your robot will solve
- Need to establish how you'll know if it succeeds
- Need to define the environment it will operate in
- Need to establish limitations or rules

### Engineering Design Process
- Engineers start by understanding the problem they need to solve
- A well-defined problem makes finding a solution easier
- Different challenges require different robot capabilities
