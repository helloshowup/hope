## Planning and Design Application
- The planning stage is like drawing a blueprint before building a house
- Good planning saves time and helps avoid problems later
- A robot design plan includes details about all parts of the robot
- Sketching what the robot will look like from different angles is part of planning

## Robot Components
- Motors: Control the wheels so the robot can turn
- Light sensors: Detect lines on the ground
- Controller board: Runs programs and connects parts
- Wheels: Move the robot smoothly on surfaces

## Success Criteria
- Success criteria are specific goals that help you know if your robot works well
- Success criteria should be measurable
- Success criteria answer: "How will I know if my robot is successful?"
- Success criteria should be written down before building begins

## Project Management Basics
- Project management helps organize time, materials, and tasks
- A timeline includes specific deadlines for each project stage
- Materials lists should be created before building starts
- Breaking down big tasks into smaller steps is recommended
- A project journal records daily activities and problem solutions

## Resources and Materials Management
- An inventory of all parts and materials is needed before starting
- Materials should be grouped by category
- A clean, organized workspace is important
- Electronic parts can be damaged by static electricity
- Many robot parts can be reused in future projects

## Timeline Development
- Start with the final deadline and work backward
- Project phases include planning, building, programming, testing, and documentation
- Specific milestones help check progress
- Buffer time should be included for unexpected problems
- A visual timeline chart helps stay on track
