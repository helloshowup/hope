# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Design Process vs. Trial-and-Error Basics

- **Definition of trial-and-error approach**
  - Starting to build without planning
  - Testing in the environment and making changes until it works
  - Example: immediately putting parts together for a maze robot without planning

- **Definition of design process approach**
  - Carefully planning a robot before building
  - Drawing diagrams and thinking about components needed
  - Example: planning what sensors and movements a maze robot needs before building

## Drawbacks of Trial-and-Error

- **Inefficiency issues**
  - Often time-consuming
  - May repeat the same mistakes multiple times
  - Miss obvious solutions due to random changes

- **Documentation problems**
  - Difficult to track what has been tried
  - Hard to know which changes actually helped performance
  - Makes learning from the process challenging

- **Resource limitations**
  - Can waste materials
  - May use up budget before finding a solution
  - Consumes more time than planned approaches

## Advantages of Systematic Design

- **Organizational benefits**
  - Provides a clear roadmap for the project
  - Helps stay focused throughout development
  - Especially useful for complex robots

- **Documentation benefits**
  - Creates records of problem definitions
  - Documents research findings
  - Preserves design plans and test results

- **Professional relevance**
  - Mirrors how professional engineers work
  - Prepares students for careers in engineering
  - Standard approach in the robotics industry

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Best situations for systematic design**
  - Complex projects with multiple components
  - Projects with limited resources or time
  - Team projects requiring communication
  - Projects where safety is critical

- **Appropriate times for trial-and-error elements**
  - Quick explorations during ideation
  - Simple adjustments during fine-tuning
  - Learning about unfamiliar components
  - When the cost of failure is very low

## Roomba Case Study Facts

- **Problem definition**
  - People dislike vacuuming
  - Need for automatic floor cleaning
  - Must work on different floor surfaces

- **Key design decisions**
  - Round shape to navigate around furniture
  - Combination of brushes and suction for cleaning
  - Sensors to detect and avoid stairs

- **Testing process**
  - Tested in mock home environments
  - Evaluated on various floor surfaces
  - Had real families test prototypes
