  - Examples of criteria categories:
    - "Can we build it?"
    - "Does it work well?"
    - "What resources do we need?"
    - "Is it easy to use?"
    - "Is it strong and reliable?"

- **Decision Matrix**

  - Steps to create one:
    1. Make a table with ideas across the top
    2. List criteria down the side
    3. Give each criterion an importance number (1-5)
    4. Score each idea on each criterion (1-5)
    5. Multiply scores by importance numbers
    6. Add up all scores for each idea
    7. Highest score wins

- **What to do if two ideas get the same score**
  - Add another important feature to judge them on
  - Build simple test versions of both
  - Combine the best parts from each idea

- Need to establish how you'll know if it succeeds
- Need to define the environment it will operate in
- Need to establish limitations or rules

### Engineering Design Process
