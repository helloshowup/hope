## Basic Facts About Engineering Design

- Engineering design is a creative and organized way to solve problems
- Engineering design follows specific steps rather than random guessing
- Engineering design in robotics helps create robots that can complete specific tasks

## The Five Steps of Engineering Design

- Step 1: Define the Problem - Clearly state what problem needs to be solved
- Step 2: Research & Brainstorm - Gather information and come up with possible solutions
- Step 3: Plan & Design - Select the best solution and create detailed plans
- Step 4: Build & Test - Create a prototype and see if it works
- Step 5: Improve - Make changes based on testing results and try again

## Benefits of Systematic Approach vs. Trial-and-Error

- Systematic design saves time and resources
- Systematic design helps consider multiple solutions
- Systematic design makes troubleshooting easier
- Systematic design records what works and what doesn't
- Trial-and-error makes random changes
- Trial-and-error often wastes resources

## Robotics Design Facts

- Robots are complex systems with many interacting parts
- When designing robots, engineers must consider:
  - Mechanical components (wheels, arms)
  - Electronic systems (sensors, motors)
  - Programming (instructions for the robot)

## Mars Rover Example

- NASA engineers designed Mars rovers using the engineering design process
- Mars rover challenges included:
  - Landing safely on Mars
  - Moving across rough terrain
  - Gathering scientific data
  - Communicating information back to Earth
