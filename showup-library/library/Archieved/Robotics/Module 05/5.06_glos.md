## Algorithm
**Definition:**  A step-by-step set of instructions that tells a computer or robot how to complete a task or solve a problem.
**Example:**  Following a recipe to bake cookies is like using an algorithm - you follow specific steps in order to get the result you want.

## Block-based Programming
**Definition:**  A visual way to code using colorful blocks that snap together like puzzle pieces instead of typing text commands.
**Example:**  In Scratch or LEGO MINDSTORMS, you drag and connect blocks to make your robot move forward or turn.

## Bug
**Definition:**  A mistake or error in a program that causes it to work incorrectly or crash.
**Example:**  If your robot keeps turning left when it should go straight, your program has a bug that needs fixing.

## Calibration
**Definition:**  The process of adjusting sensors so they give accurate readings in different environments.
**Example:**  Before a line-following competition, you might calibrate your robot's light sensor to work in the bright gym lighting.

## Code
**Definition:**  Instructions written in a language that computers or robots can understand.
**Example:**  You write code to tell your robot when to move forward, turn, or stop when it sees an obstacle.

## Conditional Statement
**Definition:**  A programming instruction that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.
**Example:**  IF it's raining THEN bring an umbrella ELSE wear sunglasses - this is how robots make decisions too!

## Debugging
**Definition:**  The process of finding and fixing errors or problems in a program.
**Example:**  When your robot keeps crashing into walls, you debug by checking your distance sensor code.

## Decomposition
**Definition:**  Breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts that are easier to solve.
**Example:**  To program a robot soccer player, you might break it down into: finding the ball, moving to the ball, and kicking the ball.

## Edge Case
**Definition:**  An unusual situation that might cause problems in your program and needs special handling.
**Example:**  What happens if your line-following robot reaches the end of the line? That's an edge case you need to plan for.

## Function
**Definition:**  A reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called upon.
**Example:**  You could create a 'dance' function that makes your robot spin and flash lights, then use it whenever you want.

## Input
**Definition:**  Information that goes into a computer or robot, often from sensors or user controls.
**Example:**  When you press a button on your robot, that button press is an input that tells it to start moving.

## Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Framework
**Definition:**  A model showing how robots take in information, think about it, and then do something as a result.
**Example:**  Your robot sees an obstacle (input), decides it needs to avoid it (processing), and turns left (output).

## Logic Error
**Definition:**  A mistake in a program where the code runs without crashing but doesn't do what you intended.
**Example:**  If you tell your robot to turn right when it should turn left, that's a logic error - the program works but does the wrong thing.

## Loop
**Definition:**  A programming instruction that repeats a section of code multiple times.
**Example:**  To draw a square, you could use a loop that repeats 'move forward, turn right 90 degrees' four times.

## Output
**Definition:**  The result or action produced by a computer or robot after processing information.
**Example:**  When your robot's program decides to turn on its lights or move its wheels, those actions are outputs.

## Processing
**Definition:**  The step where a robot's program interprets information and decides what to do next.
**Example:**  When your robot detects an obstacle, it processes this information to decide whether to stop, turn, or back up.

## Programming
**Definition:**  The process of creating instructions that tell a computer or robot what to do.
**Example:**  When you create a set of commands to make your LEGO robot navigate a maze, you're programming.

## Runtime Error
**Definition:**  A problem that occurs while a program is running, often causing it to crash or stop working.
**Example:**  If your robot tries to use a sensor that isn't connected, it will get a runtime error and might stop moving.

## Sensor
**Definition:**  A device that detects changes in the environment and sends this information to the robot's brain.
**Example:**  A light sensor helps your robot follow a black line on a white background by detecting the difference in brightness.

## Sequence
**Definition:**  A set of instructions performed in a specific order, one after another.
**Example:**  To make a peanut butter sandwich, you follow a sequence: get bread, spread peanut butter, add jelly, close sandwich.

## Syntax Error
**Definition:**  A mistake in how code is written that breaks the rules of the programming language.
**Example:**  Forgetting to close a bracket or misspelling a command creates a syntax error, like a grammar mistake in writing.

## Threshold Value
**Definition:**  A specific number that determines when a robot should change its behavior based on sensor readings.
**Example:**  If your light sensor reads below 50, follow the dark line; if above 50, look for the line again.

## Variable
**Definition:**  A container that stores information in a program, like a number, text, or sensor reading.
**Example:**  Your robot might use a variable called 'speed' to remember how fast it should move at different times.
