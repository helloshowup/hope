## **Common Sequence Errors and Solutions**

Even experienced programmers make mistakes when creating sequences. Let's explore common errors and how to fix them.

### **Typical Sequence Problems**
1. **Missing steps**: Skipping a necessary action in the sequence
2. **Incorrect order**: Putting steps in an illogical order
3. **Ambiguous instructions**: Using unclear directions that could be interpreted multiple ways
4. **Infinite loops**: Creating sequences that never end
- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently
- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement

### **Debugging Your Sequences**

**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code:
1. Test your sequence by walking through it step-by-step
2. Identify where things go wrong
3. Modify the sequence to fix the problem
4. Test again until it works correctly

For example, if your robot is supposed to navigate around a chair but keeps bumping into it, you might need to:
- Check if your turning angles are correct (90° vs 45°)
- Verify if your forward movement distances are appropriate
- Make sure you're not missing a step in your sequence

## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you followed directions that were out of order or had missing steps. What happened? How does this experience relate to the importance of creating precise, well-ordered algorithms in programming?

Why is the correct order important in a programming sequence?

A. It isn't important as long as all steps are included

B. It only matters for advanced programs

C. The computer won't run programs with steps in the wrong order

D. The wrong order can produce incorrect results
---answer---
The correct answer is D. The wrong order can produce incorrect results. Just like following a recipe, programming steps must be in the correct order to achieve the intended result. If you chose a different answer, remember that computers follow instructions exactly as given—they don't understand intent or rearrange steps to make sense of them.
