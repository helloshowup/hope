**Activity 1: Find the Bugs**

Review the following simple robot movement program that contains three different types of errors. Identify what type each error is (syntax, logic, or runtime) and how you would fix it:


function moveRobot() {
  forward(10);
  turn(90)
  forward(5;
  if (sensorValue > 50) {
    backwards(10);
  }
  turn(45);
  while (true) {
    forward(1);
  }
}


Try to find all three errors before checking the solution in your course materials!
