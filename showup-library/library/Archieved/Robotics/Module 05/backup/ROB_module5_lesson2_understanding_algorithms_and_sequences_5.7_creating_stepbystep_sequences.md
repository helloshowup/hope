## **Creating Step-by-Step Sequences**

Creating effective sequences requires breaking down problems into small, manageable steps. This process is called "**decomposition**" and is a fundamental programming skill.

### **Writing Clear Instructions**

When writing sequences, clarity is essential. Each step should:
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Contain only one action
- Use precise language
- Follow a logical order

Consider the difference between these instructions:
- Vague: "Make the robot move to the box"
- Clear: "Move the robot forward 3 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move forward 2 steps"
- Contain only one action

### **Logical Flow and Order**

The order of steps in a sequence matters tremendously. For example, trying to pour milk before opening the carton won't work! In programming, executing steps in the wrong order can produce completely incorrect results or cause the program to crash.

## Stop and reflect

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about making a cup of tea or coffee. What would happen if you performed the steps in a different order? Consider how changing the sequence (like adding sugar before the water) would affect the final result.
