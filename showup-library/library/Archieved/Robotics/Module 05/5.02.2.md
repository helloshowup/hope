# 5.2.2 Building Your First Programs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Create a basic sequence program using visual programming blocks
- Identify common sequence errors in visual programming
- Apply debugging techniques to fix problems in your code sequences

In visual programming environments like Scratch or Blockly, sequences are built by connecting blocks that represent different actions.

### Visual Programming Blocks

Visual programming uses colored blocks that snap together to form sequences. The blocks typically include:

- Motion blocks (move, turn)
- Control blocks (wait, repeat)
- Sensor blocks (detect obstacles)
- Output blocks (display, make sound)

Each block represents a single instruction, and the sequence reads from top to bottom.

<br/>
Think of these programming blocks like LEGO pieces. Just as you can connect different LEGO bricks to build a structure, you connect different code blocks to build a program. And just like LEGO, if you put the pieces together in the wrong way, your creation won't work as intended!

### Creating a Basic Sequence Program

Let's create a simple program for a robot to navigate around an obstacle:

1. Move forward 2 steps
2. Turn right 90 degrees
3. Move forward 3 steps
4. Turn left 90 degrees
5. Move forward 2 steps

<br/>
This sequence creates a path that moves around an imaginary obstacle in your way.

<br/>
To visualize this, imagine your robot is trying to navigate around a backpack on the classroom floor. The sequence above would guide the robot to move forward, turn right to avoid the backpack, move alongside it, turn left to get back on track, and continue forward—all without bumping into the obstacle.

### From Simple to Complex Algorithms

The same principles you use to create simple algorithms can be applied to more complex robotics challenges:

- A robot vacuum uses algorithms to map your home and clean efficiently
- A robot that follows a line on the floor uses an algorithm to detect the line and adjust its movement
- A robot arm in a factory uses algorithms to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes

As robots become more advanced, their algorithms include more steps and decision points, but they still follow the same basic principles of clear, ordered instructions.

<br/>
Did you know? NASA's Mars rovers use complex algorithms to navigate the Martian surface. When the rover encounters a rock, its algorithm helps it decide whether to go around the obstacle or over it, based on the rock's size and the surrounding terrain. Even though these algorithms are much more sophisticated than our simple examples, they still follow the same fundamental principles we're learning!

## Activity: Building a Simple Sequence

Using a visual programming environment (or drawing on paper), create a sequence of commands that would guide a robot to draw a square. Your program should include movement commands (forward, backward) and turning commands (right, left). Think carefully about the order of commands and how many times each action needs to be performed. Test your sequence by tracing through it step by step to verify it works correctly.

## Common Sequence Errors and Solutions

Even experienced programmers make mistakes when creating sequences. Let's explore common errors and how to fix them.

### Typical Sequence Problems
1. **Missing steps**: Skipping a necessary action in the sequence
2. **Incorrect order**: Putting steps in an illogical order
3. **Ambiguous instructions**: Using unclear directions that could be interpreted multiple ways
4. **Infinite loops**: Creating sequences that never end

<br/>
These errors are similar to problems you might encounter when following a recipe. If the recipe forgets to mention "preheat the oven" (missing step), tells you to frost the cake before baking it (incorrect order), says "add some sugar" without specifying how much (ambiguous instruction), or tells you to "stir until perfect" without clear stopping criteria (infinite loop), you won't get the intended result!

### Debugging Your Sequences

**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code:

1. Test your sequence by walking through it step-by-step
2. Identify where things go wrong
3. Modify the sequence to fix the problem
4. Test again until it works correctly

<br/>
For example, if your robot is supposed to navigate around a chair but keeps bumping into it, you might need to:

- Check if your turning angles are correct (90° vs 45°)
- Verify if your forward movement distances are appropriate
- Make sure you're not missing a step in your sequence

Professional programmers spend about 50% of their time debugging code! When engineers at companies like Google or Microsoft create new software, they constantly test and fix their algorithms to make sure everything works correctly. Debugging is not a sign of failure—it's a normal and important part of the programming process.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you followed directions that were out of order or had missing steps. What happened? How does this experience relate to the importance of creating precise, well-ordered algorithms in programming?

## Key Takeaways

- Visual programming uses blocks that snap together like LEGO pieces to create sequences of instructions that run from top to bottom, allowing you to control robots with simple commands.
- When building sequences, common errors include missing steps, incorrect order, unclear instructions, and infinite loops - all of which can be fixed through debugging.
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors by testing your sequence step-by-step, identifying problems, making changes, and testing again until your program works correctly.
