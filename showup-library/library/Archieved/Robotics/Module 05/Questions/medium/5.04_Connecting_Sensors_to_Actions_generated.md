## Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

### Sensor-Based Programming Concepts
- How the Input-Processing-Output (IPO) framework functions in robotic systems
  - Input: Sensors collect environmental data
  - Processing: Program interprets data and makes decisions
  - Output: Actuators perform actions based on decisions

### Conditional Programming Applications
- How "if-then-else" structures enable robots to make decisions based on sensor readings
- How multiple conditions create more complex decision pathways:
  ```
  if (distance_sensor < 5) {
      back_up();
  } else if (distance_sensor < 15) {
      turn_right();
  } else {
      move_forward();
  }
  ```
