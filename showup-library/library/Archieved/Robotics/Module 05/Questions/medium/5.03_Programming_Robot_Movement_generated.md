## MEDIUM-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

### Understanding Basic Movement Commands
- How different programming environments might represent the same movement concepts (e.g., `move(100)` vs `forward(100)`)
- The relationship between movement commands and real-world directions
- How robots interpret movement commands differently based on environmental factors (carpet vs tile)
- Why robots need precise movement commands rather than general instructions

### Creating Movement Patterns
- How to combine basic commands to create specific geometric shapes
- The relationship between angle measurements and resulting shapes (90° for squares, 120° for triangles)
- How movement patterns change based on the robot's environment or purpose
- Applications of movement patterns in real-world scenarios (security robots, delivery robots)

### Combining Multiple Movements
