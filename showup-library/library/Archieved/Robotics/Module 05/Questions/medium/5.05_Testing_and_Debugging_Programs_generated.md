## Medium-Level Content for Multiple-Choice Questions

### Types of Programming Errors
- How logic errors differ from syntax errors
  - Logic errors produce incorrect results despite syntactically correct code
  - Logic errors are typically harder to detect than syntax errors
- Examples of logic errors in robotics
  - Programming a robot to turn at incorrect angles (80° vs 90°)
  - Setting sensor thresholds inappropriately
  - Testing conditions in the wrong order
- Runtime error characteristics
  - Occur during program execution rather than before running
  - Cause programs to crash or stop executing
  - Examples include division by zero or accessing non-existent variables

### The Debugging Process
- How to systematically reproduce problems
  - Identifying specific conditions that trigger the error
  - Creating consistent test scenarios that demonstrate the bug
- Techniques for locating error sources
  - Using print statements to track variable values
  - Commenting out sections to isolate problem areas
  - Working backwards from where incorrect behavior appears
- Effective error fixing approaches
  - Making single, focused changes rather than multiple simultaneous fixes
  - Testing after each individual change
  - Relationship between clearly defined expected behavior and debugging efficiency

### Testing Strategies
- Input testing categories and applications
  - Normal expected values vs boundary values
  - How to test boundary conditions in line-following robots
  - Invalid input handling considerations
- Edge case identification and importance
  - Unusual but possible scenarios like sensor returning zero
