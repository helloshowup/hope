## Types of Programming Errors
- **Syntax Errors**
  - Spelling and grammar mistakes in code
  - Examples: missing brackets, misspelled commands, missing punctuation
  - Most programming environments detect these immediately

- **Logic Errors**
  - Code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results
  - Examples: wrong formula, infinite loop, testing conditions in wrong order
  - In robotics: telling robot to turn right when it should turn left

- **Runtime Errors**
  - Problems that occur while the program is running
  - Examples: dividing by zero, referring to nonexistent variables
  - Cause programs to crash or stop executing

## The Debugging Process
- Four steps to debug a program:
  - Step 1: Reproduce the problem consistently
  - Step 2: Identify expected vs. actual behavior
  - Step 3: Locate the source of the error
  - Step 4: Fix the error and test one change at a time

## Testing Scenarios
- **Input Testing Types**
  - Normal expected values
  - Boundary values (minimum and maximum)
  - Invalid inputs

- **Edge Cases**
  - Unusual but possible scenarios
  - Examples: sensor returns zero, robot reaches barrier, low battery

- **Incremental Testing**
  - Write small piece of functionality
  - Test thoroughly
  - Add next feature when current one works correctly

## Program Improvement Strategies
- **Refactoring for Clarity**
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Break long functions into smaller ones
  - Add explanatory comments

- **Documentation**
  - Explain what the program does
  - Document assumptions or limitations
  - Note special cases or considerations

## Test Plan Components
- Basic functionality tests
- Sensor tests
- Environmental tests
- Edge case tests
