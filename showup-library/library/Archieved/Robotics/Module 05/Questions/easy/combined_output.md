## What is Programming?
- Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers/machines
- Code is a set of instructions written in languages computers understand
- Programming is like writing a recipe for a robot to follow
- Programming requires precise instructions (unlike human communication)
- Programming follows logical patterns and sequences

## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- Input: Sensors detect the environment (light sensors, touch sensors, cameras)
- Processing: The robot's program interprets sensor data and decides actions
- Output: The program produces results (movement, displays, sounds, other actions)
- This framework shows how robots interact with their environment

## Example: School Security System
- Input: Motion sensor detects movement in hallway after hours
- Processing: System checks if it's during authorized hours
- Processing: System checks if a security code was entered
- Output: System might turn on lights, sound alarm, alert security

## Key Programming Concepts: Variables
- Variables are containers that store information
- Variables can hold numbers, text, or more complex data
- In robotics, variables might store sensor readings, motor speeds, or coordinates
- Example: A robot vacuum tracks battery level in a variable called "batteryPower"

## Key Programming Concepts: Conditions
- Conditions allow programs to make decisions based on criteria
- "If-then-else" statements help robots respond to their environment
- Example: "If front sensor detects obstacle, then turn right, else continue forward"

## Key Programming Concepts: Loops
- Loops allow programs to repeat actions multiple times
- Loops are essential for repetitive tasks
- Example: A robot arm repeatedly picking items from a conveyor belt

## Key Programming Concepts: Functions
- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
- Functions help organize code and prevent repetition
- Functions are like pre-programmed moves a robot can perform

## Block-Based Programming
- Uses colorful blocks instead of typing text commands
- Blocks fit together like puzzle pieces
- Similar to building with LEGO bricks
- Blocks won't connect if the logic doesn't make sense

## Benefits of Block-Based Programming
- Reduces syntax errors
- Provides visual feedback
- Helps focus on concepts rather than typing
- Allows immediate testing of code
- Examples include LEGO MINDSTORMS, VEX Blocks, micro:bit MakeCode

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Algorithm Concepts
- An **algorithm** is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task or solve a problem
- Algorithms are like recipes that tell you exactly what to do and in what order
- Algorithms are the foundation of how computers process information
- Computers need precise, ordered steps to follow

## Real-World Algorithm Examples
- Everyday algorithms include:
  - Tying shoes
  - Brushing teeth
  - Making a sandwich
- Technology algorithms include:
  - Racing games calculating when cars should slow down
  - School security systems deciding when to lock doors
  - Music apps suggesting songs based on listening history
  - Traffic lights controlling signal timing

## Algorithm Components
- Each step in an algorithm should:
  - Be specific and unambiguous
  - Contain only one action
  - Use precise language
  - Follow a logical order

## Order in Algorithms
- The order of steps in a sequence matters tremendously
- Executing steps in the wrong order can produce incorrect results
- Example: pouring milk before opening the carton won't work

## Visual Programming Basics
- Visual programming uses colored blocks that snap together
- Common block types include:
  - Motion blocks (move, turn)
  - Control blocks (wait, repeat)
  - Sensor blocks (detect obstacles)
  - Output blocks (display, make sound)
- Blocks are connected from top to bottom

## Common Sequence Errors
- Missing steps: Skipping a necessary action
- Incorrect order: Putting steps in an illogical order
- Ambiguous instructions: Using unclear directions
- Infinite loops: Creating sequences that never end

## Debugging
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code
- Professional programmers spend about 50% of their time debugging code

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Robot Movement Commands
- **forward(distance)**: Moves the robot forward by the specified distance
- **backward(distance)**: Moves the robot backward by the specified distance  
- **left(degrees)**: Rotates the robot left by the specified number of degrees
- **right(degrees)**: Rotates the robot right by the specified number of degrees
- **wait(seconds)**: Pauses the robot's execution for the specified number of seconds

## Simple Movement Patterns
- **Line pattern** consists of:
  - Moving forward
  - Waiting
  - Moving backward

- **Square pattern** consists of:
  - Moving forward
  - Turning left 90 degrees
  - Repeating four times

- **Triangle pattern** consists of:
  - Moving forward
  - Turning left 120 degrees
  - Repeating three times

## Common Movement Errors
- Incorrect distances or angles
- Sequence errors (commands in wrong order)
- Missing commands
- Timing issues

## Debugging Process Steps
- Observe the robot's actual behavior
- Identify where deviation occurs
- Hypothesize about the cause
- Test by making a single change
- Repeat until fixed

## Real-World Applications
- Robot vacuums move differently on carpet versus tile floors
- School security robots patrol hallways
- Hospital delivery robots navigate corridors to deliver medications

# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Sensor Concepts
- Sensors act as the "eyes," "ears," and "sense of touch" for robots
- Sensors convert physical phenomena like light, sound, or pressure into electrical signals
- In programming terms, sensors provide the **inputs** that drive decision-making
- Without sensors, a robot would be like a person trying to navigate with eyes closed and ears plugged

## Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Framework
- **Input**: Sensors collect data from the environment
- **Processing**: The robot's program interprets the data and makes decisions
- **Output**: Actuators (motors, lights, speakers) perform actions based on decisions
- Example: automatic doors at a grocery store use motion sensors (input), control system (processing), and motors (output)

## Conditional Statements
- Conditional statements are typically "if-then-else" structures
- They allow robots to make decisions based on sensor readings
- Basic structure: if (sensor_value meets condition) {do_something();} else {do_something_else();}
- Example: "If there's an obstacle less than 10 centimeters away, turn right; otherwise, keep moving forward"

## Threshold Values
- Thresholds are specific values that trigger different actions
- Example: A light sensor might return values from 0 (darkness) to 1023 (bright light)
- A threshold of 500 might separate "dark line" from "light background"
- Thresholds are similar to temperature settings on a thermostat

## Testing Approaches
- Start with controlled inputs to verify basic functionality
- Test edge cases at the boundaries of threshold values
- Create realistic test scenarios similar to intended environment
- Use incremental development starting with simple behaviors

## Common Sensor Challenges
- Environmental conditions like lighting can affect sensor performance
- Sensors may need regular recalibration to maintain accuracy
- Power fluctuations can affect sensor readings
- Calibration helps robots adjust to specific conditions

- **Runtime Errors**
  - Problems that occur while the program is running
  - Examples: dividing by zero, referring to nonexistent variables
  - Cause programs to crash or stop executing

## The Debugging Process
- Four steps to debug a program:
  - Step 1: Reproduce the problem consistently
  - Step 2: Identify expected vs. actual behavior
  - Step 3: Locate the source of the error
  - Step 4: Fix the error and test one change at a time

## Testing Scenarios
- **Input Testing Types**
  - Normal expected values
  - Boundary values (minimum and maximum)
  - Invalid inputs

- **Edge Cases**
  - Unusual but possible scenarios
  - Examples: sensor returns zero, robot reaches barrier, low battery

- **Incremental Testing**
  - Write small piece of functionality
  - Test thoroughly
  - Add next feature when current one works correctly

## Program Improvement Strategies
- **Refactoring for Clarity**
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Break long functions into smaller ones
  - Add explanatory comments

- **Documentation**
  - Explain what the program does
  - Document assumptions or limitations
  - Note special cases or considerations
