# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## What is Programming?
- Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers/machines
- Code is a set of instructions written in languages computers understand
- Programming is like writing a recipe for a robot to follow
- Programming requires precise instructions (unlike human communication)
- Programming follows logical patterns and sequences

## Input-Processing-Output Framework
- Input: Sensors detect the environment (light sensors, touch sensors, cameras)
- Processing: The robot's program interprets sensor data and decides actions
- Output: The program produces results (movement, displays, sounds, other actions)
- This framework shows how robots interact with their environment

## Example: School Security System
- Input: Motion sensor detects movement in hallway after hours
- Processing: System checks if it's during authorized hours
- Processing: System checks if a security code was entered
- Output: System might turn on lights, sound alarm, alert security

## Key Programming Concepts: Variables
- Variables are containers that store information
- Variables can hold numbers, text, or more complex data
- In robotics, variables might store sensor readings, motor speeds, or coordinates
- Example: A robot vacuum tracks battery level in a variable called "batteryPower"

## Key Programming Concepts: Conditions
- Conditions allow programs to make decisions based on criteria
- "If-then-else" statements help robots respond to their environment
- Example: "If front sensor detects obstacle, then turn right, else continue forward"

## Key Programming Concepts: Loops
- Loops allow programs to repeat actions multiple times
- Loops are essential for repetitive tasks
- Example: A robot arm repeatedly picking items from a conveyor belt

## Key Programming Concepts: Functions
- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
- Functions help organize code and prevent repetition
- Functions are like pre-programmed moves a robot can perform

## Block-Based Programming
- Uses colorful blocks instead of typing text commands
- Blocks fit together like puzzle pieces
- Similar to building with LEGO bricks
- Blocks won't connect if the logic doesn't make sense

## Benefits of Block-Based Programming
- Reduces syntax errors
- Provides visual feedback
- Helps focus on concepts rather than typing
- Allows immediate testing of code
- Examples include LEGO MINDSTORMS, VEX Blocks, micro:bit MakeCode
