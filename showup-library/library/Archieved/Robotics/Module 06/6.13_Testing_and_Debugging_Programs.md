# **Testing and Debugging Programs**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Name the three main types of coding errors
- Tell how each error type is different
- Find and fix simple errors in robot code

### **Lesson Podcast Discussion: The Importance of Systematic Debugging**

This podcast explores how a structured debugging approach helps programmers efficiently identify and solve problems in their code.

## **Common Programming Errors**

When programming robots, several types of errors commonly occur. Understanding these error types helps you identify and fix them quickly.

### **Syntax Errors**

**Syntax errors** occur when your code doesn't follow the rules of the programming language. These are usually caught by the compiler or interpreter before your program runs. Examples include:
- Missing punctuation (like semicolons or parentheses)
- Misspelled commands
- Incorrect capitalization
- Using incorrect formatting

Think of syntax errors like spelling or grammar mistakes in writing. Just as your teacher might mark these errors in your essay, the computer marks these errors in your code. For example, if you wrote `forwrd()` instead of `forward()`, the computer would show a syntax error because it doesn't recognize the misspelled command.

### **Logic Errors**

**Logic errors** are mistakes in the program's design that cause it to behave incorrectly. These errors don't prevent the program from running but cause incorrect results. Examples include:
- Using the wrong operator (+ instead of -)
- Incorrect sequence of commands
- Faulty conditional statements (if/else)
- Infinite loops

Logic errors can be tricky because your program runs without error messages, but it doesn't do what you want. Imagine you're giving directions to a friend: "Turn left at the stop sign, then right at the traffic light." If you meant to say "Turn right at the stop sign," your friend would follow your directions perfectly but end up in the wrong place. That's similar to a logic error in programming.

### **Runtime Errors**

**Runtime errors** occur while your program is running. These can cause your program to crash or produce unexpected results. Examples include:
- Dividing by zero
- Accessing variables or functions that don't exist
- Running out of memory
- Trying to perform impossible actions (like telling a robot to move through a wall)

Runtime errors happen when your code tries to do something impossible. It's like if you tried to divide 10 by 0 on your calculator - the calculator would show an error because division by zero isn't possible. Similarly, if your robot program tries to move through a wall, you'll get a runtime error because the robot can't physically do that.

## Key Takeaways
- Syntax errors are like spelling mistakes in your code that the computer catches before your program runs.
- Logic errors make your program run but produce incorrect results because the steps are in the wrong order or use the wrong operations.
- Runtime errors happen during program execution when your code tries to do something impossible, like dividing by zero or moving through walls.
