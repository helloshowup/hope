## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Break down big tasks into small, clear steps
- Explain what an algorithm is using your own words
- Build a simple program using blocks in order

## Breaking Down Complex Tasks
Complex problems become manageable when broken into smaller steps. For example, the task "make a sandwich" might seem simple, but to program a robot to do it would require dozens of precise instructions: open bread bag, remove two slices, open peanut butter jar, pick up knife, etc.

When breaking down complex tasks, it helps to think like a robot that has no prior knowledge. Imagine explaining how to tie shoelaces to someone who has never seen shoes before. You'd need to explain what laces are, where to find them, how to hold them, and the exact motions needed to create a knot. This level of detail is what makes algorithms work for computers, which can't fill in gaps or make assumptions like humans can.

### Different Approaches to the Same Problem

There's often more than one way to solve a problem! Let's look at two different algorithms for sorting books on a shelf:

**Algorithm 1: Bubble Sort Approach**
1. Start at the beginning of the shelf
2. Compare the first two books
3. If they're out of order, swap them
4. Move to the next pair of books
5. Repeat until you reach the end
6. Start over from the beginning until no swaps are needed

**Algorithm 2: Selection Sort Approach**
1. Find the book that should be first (like the one that starts with "A")
2. Put that book in the first position
3. Find the book that should be second
4. Put that book in the second position
5. Continue until all books are in place

Both algorithms solve the same problem but in different ways. The first might be easier for a person, while the second might be more efficient for a robot with a camera that can scan all books at once!

## **Activity 1: Break Down a Daily Task**
Choose a simple daily task like tying your shoes or making a bowl of cereal. Write out every single step required to complete this task, being as detailed and precise as possible. Try to be so specific that someone who has never done this task before could follow your instructions perfectly. After writing your steps, check for any assumptions or missing details that might confuse your "computer."

## Building Your First Programs
Now that we understand algorithms as step-by-step instructions, let's translate this knowledge into actual programs using our visual programming environment.

### Block-Based Sequence Programming
In our visual programming environment, each instruction is represented by a **block**. To create a sequence:
1. Drag the blocks you need from the toolbox
2. Connect them in the correct order from top to bottom
3. Make sure each block has the correct parameters set
4. Run your program to see if it works as expected

The computer executes these blocks in order, starting from the top and moving downward, just like reading a book.

Block-based programming makes it easy to visualize your algorithm. Each block represents one instruction, and the shape and color of the blocks help you understand what they do. For example, movement blocks might be blue, while action blocks might be green. When blocks are connected, they form a sequence that the computer follows exactly as arranged.

Let's say we want to program a character to walk in a square pattern. Our sequence might look like this:
- Move forward 10 steps
- Turn right 90 degrees
- Move forward 10 steps
- Turn right 90 degrees
- Move forward 10 steps
- Turn right 90 degrees
- Move forward 10 steps

By connecting these blocks in order, we've created a simple algorithm that makes our character trace a square!

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How would changing the order of steps (like putting jelly on before opening the bread) affect the final outcome? Consider how the order of operations impacts the results of even simple algorithms.
