# Sequencer game scrambled instructions

**This lesson could be followed by this game:**
Sequencer game: Students are presented with a series of scrambled instructions for a helper robot (like a robot that should deliver medicine to a patient). They must arrange these instructions in the correct order to create a working algorithm. For example, instructions might include "Check if patient needs medicine," "Navigate to patient's room," "Pick up medicine from storage," "Deliver medicine to patient," and "Return to charging station." Students must determine the logical sequence that would allow the robot to successfully complete its helper task.
