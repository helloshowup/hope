# 7.13 Glossary For Module 8 

## Algorithm
**Definition:**  A step-by-step set of instructions that solves a problem or completes a task.

**Example:**  Following a recipe to make cookies is an algorithm - you follow specific steps in order to get delicious cookies at the end!

## Block-based programming
**Definition:**  A way to code using visual puzzle-like pieces that snap together instead of typing text.

**Example:**  In Scratch or LEGO MINDSTORMS, you drag and connect colorful blocks to make your robot move or play sounds.

## Bug
**Definition:**  A mistake or error in a program that makes it work incorrectly or crash.

**Example:**  If your robot turns right when you told it to turn left, your program has a bug that needs fixing.

## Conditional
**Definition:**  A programming statement that makes decisions using if-then logic.

**Example:**  IF the robot's touch sensor is pressed, THEN make the robot stop and back up.

## Control structure
**Definition:**  Code that determines the order in which instructions run, like sequences, loops, and conditionals.

**Example:**  Using a loop to make your robot drive in a square by repeating 'move forward, turn right' four times.

## Debugging
**Pronunciation:**  "dee-BUG-ing"

**Definition:**  The process of finding and fixing errors in a program.

**Example:**  When your robot keeps crashing into walls, you debug by checking your distance sensor code.

## Decomposition
**Definition:**  Breaking a complex problem into smaller, simpler parts that are easier to solve.

**Example:**  Instead of programming 'clean the room' all at once, you break it into 'pick up toys', 'vacuum floor', etc.

## Function
**Definition:**  A reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called.

**Example:**  Creating a 'make_square' function that your robot can use whenever it needs to drive in a square pattern.

## Graceful degradation
**Definition:**  A robot's ability to keep working when parts of its system fail, just with reduced capabilities.

**Example:**  If a robot's camera stops working, it can still navigate using touch sensors instead of giving up completely.

## Input
**Definition:**  Information that goes into a computer or robot, like sensor readings or button presses.

**Example:**  When you press buttons on a game controller, you're providing input that tells the game what to do.

## Input-Processing-Output (IPO) model
**Definition:**  A three-step pattern where robots take in information, think about it, then act on it.

**Example:**  A smart thermostat takes in room temperature (input), decides if it's too hot (processing), then turns on AC (output).

## Logic error
**Definition:**  A mistake in a program that makes it run but produce incorrect results.

**Example:**  Your robot follows all instructions but turns left when it should turn right because you mixed up directions.

## Logical operator
**Definition:**  Special words (AND, OR, NOT) that combine or flip conditions in programming decisions.

**Example:**  IF the robot sees a red light AND hears a beep, THEN it should stop moving.

## Loop
**Definition:**  A control structure that repeats a set of instructions multiple times.

**Example:**  Using a loop to make your robot blink its lights 10 times without writing the same code over and over.

## Output
**Definition:**  The result or action produced by a computer or robot, like movement, sounds, or displays.

**Example:**  When your robot beeps and flashes lights after completing a task, those are outputs.

## Processing
**Definition:**  The thinking part where a robot makes decisions based on input information.

**Example:**  When your robot compares the distance sensor reading to decide whether to stop or keep moving.

## Programming
**Definition:**  Creating instructions that tell a computer or robot exactly what to do.

**Example:**  Writing code to make your robot follow a line on the floor or avoid obstacles.

## Programming language
**Definition:**  A special language with rules that lets humans communicate instructions to computers.

**Example:**  Scratch uses colorful blocks, while Python uses text commands to tell computers what to do.

## Runtime error
**Definition:**  A problem that happens while a program is running, causing it to crash or stop.

**Example:**  Your robot program crashes when it tries to divide by zero or access a sensor that isn't connected.

## Sensor
**Definition:**  A device that detects changes in the environment and sends this information to the robot.

**Example:**  A light sensor helps your robot follow a line by detecting the difference between light and dark surfaces.

## Sensor fusion
**Definition:**  Combining data from multiple sensors to get more reliable information.

**Example:**  A robot vacuum uses bumper sensors, cliff sensors, and cameras together to navigate safely around your home.

## Sequence
**Definition:**  Instructions that run in a specific order, one after another.

**Example:**  To make a sandwich, you follow a sequence: get bread, add peanut butter, add jelly, put slices together.

## Syntax error
**Definition:**  A mistake in how code is written that breaks the rules of the programming language.

**Example:**  Forgetting to close a bracket or misspelling a command will cause a syntax error.

## Threshold
**Definition:**  A specific value that triggers a change in a robot's behavior when crossed.

**Example:**  When light sensor reading goes below 30, the robot knows it's on the black line and should follow it.

## Variable
**Definition:**  A container that stores information in a program that might change while the program runs.

**Example:**  A score variable in a game keeps track of your points as you play and collect more.
