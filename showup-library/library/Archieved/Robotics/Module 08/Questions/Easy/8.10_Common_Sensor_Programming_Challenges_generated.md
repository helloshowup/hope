# Easy Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Sensor Concepts
- Sensors function as the "eyes and ears" of robots
- Sensors collect vital information from the environment
- Sensors allow robots to interact with the real world

## Common Sensor Reliability Issues
- **Noise and Fluctuations**: Random variations in sensor readings
- **Environmental Interference**: 
  - Lighting conditions affect vision sensors
  - Magnetic fields disturb compass sensors
- **Cross-Sensitivity**: Sensors responding to multiple environmental factors
  - Example: Temperature affecting humidity readings

## Examples of Sensor Problems
- Distance sensors giving different readings (30cm, 32cm, 29cm) for stationary objects
- Line-following robots getting confused by different floor surfaces
- Robots working well in classrooms but struggling in new locations

## Solutions for Unreliable Sensor Data
- **Filtering Techniques**: 
  - Taking multiple readings
  - Calculating averages of readings
  - Using median values from multiple readings
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Designing programs to function when sensor data is unreliable

## Types of Sensors Used Together
- Distance sensors: Detect walls and large objects from far away
- Touch sensors: Detect when the robot bumps into something
- Light sensors: Help identify different surfaces or lines to follow

## Backup Strategies
- Safe mode: Slowing down or stopping when sensors detect conflicting information
- Backup behaviors: Switching to other sensors if main sensors fail
- Confidence levels: Assigning "trust scores" to different sensor readings
