# EASY Multiple-Choice Question Content

## Basic Facts and Definitions
- Timing is crucial when combining robot movements
- Sequential timing: Waiting for one movement to complete before starting another
- Parallel timing: Having multiple parts of the robot move simultaneously
- Delayed execution: Programming pauses between movements
- Wait or delay commands pause execution for a specific amount of time

## Common Movement Issues
- Distance errors: Robot moves too far or not far enough
- Turning errors: Robot doesn't turn at the expected angle
- Environmental factors: Wheel slippage or surface changes affecting movement
- Battery levels: Lower power can reduce movement accuracy

## Robot Movement Basics
- Robots can follow paths by combining basic moves
- Speed affects turning
- Movement blocks can be simple and reusable
- Testing is essential for robotics programming
- Robots often need adjustments to work properly in the real world

## Square Path Components
- To create a square path: Forward, Left, Forward, Left, Forward, Left, Forward, Left
- A square path requires four sides
- Each turn in a square path is 90 degrees

## Assistive Robot Functions
- Assistive robots help people with limited mobility
- They need to move smoothly without jerky motions
- They must navigate carefully around furniture and through doorways
- They adjust speed based on their current task
- They respond to different floor surfaces
