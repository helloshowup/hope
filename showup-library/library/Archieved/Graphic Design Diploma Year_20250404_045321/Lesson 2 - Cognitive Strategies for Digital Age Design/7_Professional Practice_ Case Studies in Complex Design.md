# Professional Practice: Case Studies in Complex Design

# IDEO's Approach to Multi-Stakeholder Design Projects

Design projects rarely involve just a client and designer anymore. The reality is messier – you'll need to navigate the competing needs of multiple stakeholders while still delivering innovative solutions. IDEO, one of the world's leading design consultancies, has mastered this balancing act. Let's look at how their reflective approaches and collaborative techniques can help you orchestrate complex stakeholder relationships in your own design work.

## Reflective Models in Multi-Stakeholder Design

### The Human-Centred Design Triangle

IDEO positions every design challenge at the intersection of three key considerations:
- **Desirability** (what people want)
- **Feasibility** (what is technically possible)
- **Viability** (what is financially sustainable)

This approach helps designers balance competing priorities. Take IDEO's redesign of Singapore's patient experience for the Ministry of Health. They had to engage:
- Patients from diverse demographics
- Medical staff across specialisations
- Hospital operations teams
- Government health officials
- Insurance representatives

By mapping these stakeholders against the triangle, IDEO identified where priorities aligned and where trade-offs needed negotiation – something you'll face in almost any complex design project.

### The Five Whys Technique

IDEO uses "The Five Whys" to dig beneath surface-level stakeholder requests:

> When hospital administrators asked for "more efficient patient processing," IDEO designers repeatedly asked "why?" five times. This revealed the actual need wasn't just efficiency but reducing patient anxiety through better information flow – something that wouldn't have emerged without deeper questioning.

This technique stops you from solving the wrong problem, particularly important when different stakeholders have competing priorities.

## Collaborative Practices for Complex Projects

### Visualisation as Stakeholder Alignment

IDEO uses visual thinking to create shared understanding among diverse stakeholders who often speak different "languages" (technical, business, user-focused).

For their work with Ford, IDEO created experience maps that translated complex technical requirements, business constraints, and user needs into visual formats everyone could understand. These visualisations became boundary objects – tools that bridged communication gaps between engineering, marketing, and executive teams.

As graphic designers, your visual communication skills put you in a perfect position to create these kinds of alignment tools.

### Prototype-Driven Conversations

Rather than getting stuck in abstract discussions, IDEO uses tangible prototypes to focus stakeholder input. For their collaboration with PillPack (now Amazon Pharmacy), they created quick prototypes of medication management systems that gave healthcare providers, patients, and technical teams something concrete to respond to.

The project juggled multiple stakeholders:
- Patients with complex medication regimens
- Pharmacists with workflow requirements
- Insurance companies with compliance needs
- Regulatory bodies with safety standards

IDEO created a "stakeholder value map" showing how each group's needs could be met through interconnected design decisions. The resulting system satisfied regulatory requirements while delivering an intuitive patient experience.

### Co-Creation Sessions

Instead of presenting finished concepts, IDEO runs workshops where stakeholders actively participate in the design process. During their partnership with Planned Parenthood, they brought together healthcare providers, patients, administrators, and community advocates to collectively reimagine the patient experience through guided design activities.

## Over to You

Think about a design project you're working on or interested in:
- Who are all the stakeholders involved, beyond the immediate client?
- How might you visually map their relationships and influences?
- What kind of prototype could serve as a "boundary object" to facilitate communication across different stakeholder groups?
- How might applying "The Five Whys" technique reveal deeper motivations behind a client's initial brief?

## Connecting to Your Design Practice

The approaches we've explored build directly on the iterative design tools covered previously. As you prepare for upcoming exploration of Systematic Design Problem Analysis, consider how IDEO's reflective and collaborative practices provide frameworks for applying the GROW model (Goals, Reality, Options, Will) to complex design challenges.

By studying how design leaders like IDEO orchestrate multi-stakeholder projects, you're developing skills you'll need for managing the complex professional relationships that define contemporary graphic design practice – skills that will set your portfolio apart when you're ready to enter the industry.
