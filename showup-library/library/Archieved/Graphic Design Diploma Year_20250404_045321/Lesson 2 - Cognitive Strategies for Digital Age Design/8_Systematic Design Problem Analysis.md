# Systematic Design Problem Analysis

# Systematic Analysis in Design: The GROW Model

The design world loves a good problem-solving method. Building on what we've explored about IDEO's collaborative approaches, let's examine the GROW model – a practical analytical approach that can help you tackle complex design challenges with more confidence and structure.

## The GROW Model for Design Problem-Solving

Though originally developed for coaching, the GROW model has been adopted by many design professionals as a way to bring clarity to their process. It complements the creative approaches you've been developing rather than replacing them.

### G - Goal

Start by clearly defining what you're actually trying to achieve:

* What specific problem does your design need to solve?
* How will you measure whether your solution works?
* Who are the stakeholders, and what do they expect?

**Example:** If you're redesigning a food delivery app, your goal might be: "Create an interface that reduces order completion time by 30% while maintaining brand consistency and improving user satisfaction ratings."

This step stops you jumping straight to visual solutions before you've properly understood what you're trying to accomplish.

### R - Reality

Now analyse the current situation thoroughly:

* Which existing design elements are working or failing?
* What constraints are you facing (technical limitations, budget, timeline)?
* What user research or analytics shed light on the current situation?

**Example:** For the food delivery app, your reality check might reveal that user testing shows confusion at checkout, analytics indicate 40% abandonment at payment, and the client insists on keeping their established colour palette.

Understanding these constraints grounds your creative solutions in practical reality – something clients always appreciate.

### O - Options

This is where you explore multiple potential solutions:

* What different approaches could address the problems you've identified?
* Which precedents or case studies might offer inspiration?
* How might different design directions satisfy various stakeholders?

**Example:** Your options might include simplifying the checkout flow to a single page, implementing a progress indicator, creating a streamlined guest checkout, or redesigning the payment confirmation interface.

This stage encourages you to think broadly before committing to a direction – a skill that separates professionals from amateurs.

### W - Way Forward

Finally, make decisions and plan implementation:

* Which option(s) will you pursue and why?
* What specific design deliverables will you create?
* How will you measure success?

**Example:** For the app redesign, your way forward might be implementing a streamlined checkout with visual progress indicators, creating wireframes for stakeholder approval, followed by high-fidelity prototypes for user testing.

## Systematic Analysis in Real Design Projects

Let's see how professional designers apply this kind of thinking in practice:

**Case Study: Pentagram's Redesign for The Nature Conservancy**

* **Goal:** Create a visual identity that positions the organisation as modern and impactful while honouring its conservation heritage.

* **Reality:** The existing logo looked dated; stakeholders disagreed about how much change was appropriate; the identity needed to work globally across multiple applications.

* **Options:** The team explored various approaches, from subtle updates to complete reimagining, testing each against stakeholder expectations and practical constraints.

* **Way Forward:** They developed a flexible system centred around a simplified leaf icon that could adapt across applications while maintaining brand recognition. The implementation included a comprehensive style guide and digital asset library.

This systematic approach ensured that creative decisions were anchored in strategic thinking—exactly what you'll need to demonstrate in your professional portfolio. Have you noticed how the best design work always seems to have this kind of thinking behind it?

## Over to You

Think about a design project you're currently working on:

* How would you define its goal in specific, measurable terms?
* What reality constraints are you facing that might not be immediately obvious?
* What three distinct approaches could you explore before committing to a direction?
* How would you document your decision-making process to present to a client?

Try applying the GROW model to this project and note how it changes your approach. Share your experience in our next virtual meetup.

## Looking Ahead

Next, we'll build on these systematic analysis approaches by exploring the "5 Whys" technique—a method for digging deeper into design problems and uncovering root causes rather than just addressing symptoms. This will further enhance your professional problem-solving toolkit as you prepare for increasingly complex design challenges.

## Key Takeaways

* The GROW model provides a structured approach for tackling design problems systematically
* Professional designers blend creative thinking with analytical methods
* Documenting your analytical process adds value to your design solutions
* Systematic approaches help manage stakeholder expectations and justify design decisions
