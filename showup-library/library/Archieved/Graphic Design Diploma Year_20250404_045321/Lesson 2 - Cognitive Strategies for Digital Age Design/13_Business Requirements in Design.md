# Business Requirements in Design

<explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for second-year HND Graphic Design students:

1. Removed the formulaic "Welcome to..." introduction and replaced it with a more engaging, direct opening that connects to the students' professional aspirations
2. Changed American spelling to British (color → colour, etc.)
3. Added the "Over to You" heading for the reflection section as specified
4. Reduced the overuse of "comprehensive," "framework," and "ensure" which were flagged as AI patterns
5. Added more conversational elements and varied sentence structures
6. Incorporated more industry-specific language and practical examples relevant to graphic design students
7. Made the tone more personable while maintaining professionalism
8. Added some rhetorical questions to engage the reader
9. Streamlined some explanations to be more direct and practical
10. Incorporated more design-specific terminology that would resonate with the target learners

# Translating Business Objectives into Design Requirements

Translating business objectives into actionable design requirements is a vital skill that sets professional designers apart. As you prepare for your graphic design career, you'll frequently need to interpret what clients want to achieve and transform those goals into visual solutions that deliver results.

This builds directly on your previous work with stakeholder analysis methods, helping you bridge the gap between business aims and creative execution—something that employers and clients value tremendously.

## Understanding the Business-Design Connection

Great design always serves a business purpose. When clients brief you on a project, they rarely speak in design terminology. Instead, they talk about increasing sales, improving brand recognition, or engaging new audiences. Your job? Translating these commercial objectives into design requirements that guide your creative process.

> **Connection to Previous Learning:** Remember that Power/Interest grid you worked with earlier? Those high-power, high-interest stakeholders are typically the ones setting the business objectives you'll need to translate into visual solutions.

## Design Brief Development Guide

A solid design brief is your project roadmap, connecting business goals to design decisions. Here's a practical way to develop one:

1. **Project Overview**: What are you creating and why?
   - Brief description of the project scope
   - Context of the design challenge

2. **Business Objectives**: What does the client actually want to achieve?
   - Specific, measurable goals
   - How success will be measured

3. **Target Audience**: Who needs to be reached?
   - Audience demographics and psychographics
   - Their needs, preferences and pain points

4. **Key Messages**: What needs to be communicated?
   - Essential information to convey
   - Tone and voice that align with the brand

5. **Design Requirements**: How will you meet the business goals?
   - Visual elements that support business objectives
   - Functional requirements the design must satisfy

6. **Success Metrics**: How will you know if it worked?
   - KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to determine success
   - How performance will be tracked

7. **Timeline and Deliverables**: What will you produce and when?
   - Key milestones and deadlines
   - Specific files and formats required

## Business Requirement Analysis: Real-World Examples

Let's look at how this works across three different scenarios you might encounter:

### Scenario 1: Promotional Campaign for Product Launch

**Business Objective**: Increase awareness and drive initial sales of a new eco-friendly water bottle, targeting 10,000 units sold in the first quarter.

**Design Requirements**:
- Create visuals highlighting the product's sustainable materials and three key differentiating features
- Develop a consistent visual language that works across digital and print touchpoints
- Design with a colour palette that stands out from competitors while maintaining brand alignment
- Include clear call-to-action elements directing to purchase channels
- Ensure all materials include promotional pricing and limited-time offer messaging
- Incorporate QR code linking to product demonstration video
- Design for eco-friendly production methods to align with product values

### Scenario 2: Rebranding a Local Bakery

**Business Objective**: Reposition a family-owned bakery to appeal to health-conscious millennials while retaining loyal customers, aiming to increase foot traffic by 25%.

**Design Requirements**:
- Develop a logo that balances tradition (for existing customers) with contemporary elements (for new audience)
- Create a colour palette that feels contemporary yet warm and inviting
- Design packaging that highlights organic ingredients and sustainable practices
- Create signage that improves storefront visibility from the main street
- Establish a typography system that communicates both artisanal quality and modern health focus
- Include visual elements that can be easily adapted for social media content
- Create photography guidelines that showcase product quality and craftsmanship

### Scenario 3: Social Media Graphics for Non-Profit

**Business Objective**: Increase donation conversion rates by 15% and volunteer sign-ups by 20% through improved social media engagement.

**Design Requirements**:
- Create templates for impact statistics that clearly visualise the organisation's work
- Design shareable graphics that prompt emotional connection to the cause
- Develop a consistent visual system that works across different social platforms
- Include flexible space for varying text lengths while maintaining visual hierarchy
- Make sure all graphics incorporate clear pathways to volunteer or donate
- Design for accessibility with high contrast and readable typography
- Optimise all designs for mobile viewing where most engagement occurs

## Over to You

Think about a recent design project you've completed for your portfolio:
- What were the underlying business objectives (or what could they have been)?
- Try rewriting the brief using the approach above, focusing on translating business goals into specific design requirements.
- Which of the three scenarios above most closely relates to your design interests, and why?

Share your thoughts in our next virtual meetup, or upload your revised brief to the learning platform for peer feedback.

## Looking Ahead

Next time, we'll build on these concepts by providing a detailed template for systematically translating objectives into requirements. You'll also get KPI alignment checklists to make sure your designs deliver measurable results. We'll work through one of these scenarios in detail to show you how to create a requirements document that serves as both a creative guide and an accountability tool.

Remember: The most successful designers aren't just visually skilled—they're strategic partners who understand how their work drives business results. That's the difference between being a designer and becoming an invaluable creative professional.
