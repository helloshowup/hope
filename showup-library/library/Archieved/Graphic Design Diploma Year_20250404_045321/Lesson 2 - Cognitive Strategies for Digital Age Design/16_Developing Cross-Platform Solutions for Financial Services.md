# Developing Cross-Platform Solutions for Financial Services

# Prototyping Inclusive Financial Interfaces Across Devices

Taking your banking app redesign to the next level requires mastering cross-device prototyping. This practical guide builds directly on your initial wireframes and research, transforming those conceptual ideas into functional, inclusive prototypes—precisely the kind of skills that will strengthen your professional portfolio and impress potential employers.

## Creating Responsive Components in Figma

For financial interfaces to work effectively across smartphones, tablets and desktops while serving diverse user groups, responsive design isn't just nice to have—it's fundamental. Let's explore techniques that demonstrate your technical proficiency.

### Step-by-Step Component Creation

1. **Set up your responsive frames**
   Begin by creating frames for each device size (mobile, tablet, desktop). Use Figma's frame presets to ensure industry-standard dimensions.

2. **Establish component variants**
   For key elements like navigation bars and transaction cards:
   * Create a base component
   * Add properties for different states (default, hover, active)
   * Add responsive variants using the Properties panel
   * Document accessibility considerations for each variant

   > **Example:** For a transaction history card, create variants that display differently on mobile (compact view) versus desktop (expanded view), while maintaining consistent information hierarchy that works for both younger and older users.

3. **Implement auto-layout for flexibility**
   Apply auto-layout to components to ensure they respond appropriately when content changes or when viewed on different devices.

## Cross-Device Navigation Patterns

Navigation presents particular challenges in financial apps where users need quick access to critical information regardless of their device or technical comfort level.

### Implementation Process

1. **Map user journeys across devices**
   Document how users might start a task on one device and complete it on another. This shows your understanding of real-world user behaviour.

2. **Create consistent navigation landmarks**
   Design navigation elements that maintain consistent positioning and functionality across devices while adapting to different screen sizes:
   
   * **Mobile:** Prioritise bottom navigation for thumb-friendly access to primary functions
   * **Tablet:** Implement a hybrid approach with collapsible side navigation
   * **Desktop:** Employ expanded horizontal navigation with dropdown menus

3. **Implement progressive disclosure**
   Use this technique to simplify complex financial information:
   * Show essential information first
   * Allow users to expand for more details
   * Consider how this serves both tech-savvy users and those who prefer simpler interfaces

## Accessible Design System Development

Let's formalise our accessibility considerations into a proper design system—a skill that's increasingly valued by professional design teams.

### Key Components

* **Colour contrast verification** - Document WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all text elements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
* **Typography scaling** - Implement a responsive type system that maintains readability across devices
* **Focus states** - Create clear visual indicators for keyboard navigation
* **Touch targets** - Size appropriately for users with varying dexterity (minimum 44×44px)
* **Alternative text** - Include fields for descriptive text in your component documentation

## Documenting Your Process

Strong documentation sets professional designers apart and will strengthen your portfolio:

1. Create a systematic approach to versioning your designs
2. Document specific changes made in response to user feedback
3. Maintain a decision log explaining the rationale behind major design choices
4. Use Figma comments to track ongoing discussions about specific elements

## Over to You

Before our next session, experiment with creating a responsive transaction card component that works across three device sizes. Consider:

1. How does information hierarchy change between devices?
2. What accessibility features are essential for financial information?
3. How might you accommodate both younger users who want data visualisation and older users who might prefer tabular information?

Document your process and decisions—this documentation will form a valuable addition to your professional portfolio, demonstrating both your technical skills and your thoughtful approach to inclusive design.

## Looking Forward

Next, we'll explore "Financial App Design System Templates," providing practical resources to implement these concepts systematically, including component libraries and accessibility checklists that will help you create comprehensive design systems for your own financial interface projects.

### Summary of Changes:

* Removed the word "module" when self-referencing to make the content feel more conversational and less like a formal course structure
* Simplified the introduction and conclusion sections to be more direct and action-oriented
* Maintained the practical, hands-on approach that aligns with the learner profile's preference for visual and practical learning
* Preserved all the technical content and portfolio-building elements that are crucial for the target learner's professional development
