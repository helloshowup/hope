# Reimagining a Financial App for Multiple Generations

<Explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for HND Graphic Design learners:

1. Removed the formulaic "Welcome to" introduction and replaced it with a more engaging, direct opening that gets straight to the point
2. Converted American spelling to British (e.g., color → colour, organize → organise)
3. Added the "Over to You" heading for the reflection section
4. Varied sentence structures to feel less formulaic and more natural
5. Reduced overuse of AI buzzwords like "ensure," "comprehensive," and "robust"
6. Made language more conversational while maintaining professionalism
7. Added more concrete examples that design students can relate to
8. Simplified some complex sentences while preserving technical content
9. Created more natural transitions between sections
10. Added some rhetorical questions to engage learners directly

# Cross-Generational Banking App Redesign: Prototyping for Diverse Users

This practical exploration tackles advanced prototyping techniques through a real-world design challenge. As second-year graphic design students preparing for professional careers, you'll regularly face projects requiring you to balance diverse user needs. This builds directly on your previous work with business requirements, showing how those requirements translate into actionable prototyping decisions.

Your challenge: redesign a banking app that effectively serves both tech-savvy Gen Z users and older demographics with varying digital comfort levels. This scenario mirrors the complex briefs you'll encounter in professional practice and provides an excellent opportunity to develop your prototyping skills in Adobe XD.

## The Cross-Generational Banking Challenge

Imagine FinanceFirst Bank has commissioned you to redesign their mobile banking application. Their business requirements include:

- Increasing mobile banking adoption among users 55+
- Retaining their growing Gen Z customer base
- Reducing customer service calls related to app navigation by 30%
- Supporting multiple device sizes with a consistent experience
- Meeting WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

This highlights a common design tension you'll face in your career: creating interfaces that feel intuitive to digital natives while remaining accessible to those with different technology comfort levels.

## Synthesising User Research in Adobe XD

Before creating wireframes, we need to organise and analyse our user research effectively:

1. **Create a Research Synthesis Board in Adobe XD:**
   - Set up an artboard titled "Research Synthesis"
   - Import user interview highlights as colour-coded sticky notes (blue for Gen Z, orange for 55+)
   - Use Adobe XD's grouping feature to cluster insights by theme

2. **Develop User Personas:**
   - Create visual persona profiles for two key users:
     - **Maya (22):** Digital native who banks exclusively through mobile apps
     - **Robert (67):** Transitioning from in-branch to digital banking

3. **Create a Comparative Needs Matrix:**
   - Map different user priorities side by side:
     - Gen Z: Quick biometric logins, instant transfers, modern aesthetics
     - Older users: Clear navigation, explicit confirmation steps, larger touch targets

## Developing Persona-Based Wireframes

Using our research insights, let's create initial wireframes that address different user needs:

1. **For Maya's User Journey:**
   - Streamlined authentication with biometric options
   - Prominent P2P (person-to-person) payment features
   - Data visualisation for spending patterns
   - Minimalist visual design with bold typography

2. **For Robert's User Journey:**
   - Clear labelling and explicit navigation
   - Step-by-step transaction flows with confirmation screens
   - Prominent help features and tooltips
   - Visual confirmation for completed actions

**Key Insight:** We're not creating separate apps but identifying design patterns that can adapt to different user preferences within a single cohesive application. Think about how apps like Monzo or Starling have managed this balance.

## Setting Up a Multi-Device Design System

A solid design system ensures consistency across devices while accommodating different user needs:

1. **Establish a Component Library:**
   - Create a practical UI kit with flexible components
   - Design adaptive navigation patterns that transform appropriately by device
   - Develop a responsive grid system for phone, tablet, and desktop views

2. **Implement a Scalable Typography System:**
   - Define a type scale that maintains readability across devices
   - Check for sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
   - Create text styles that can scale without breaking layouts

3. **Design Flexible Interactive Elements:**
   - Create components with multiple states (default, hover, active, focused)
   - Make sure touch targets exceed minimum size requirements
   - Design consistent feedback mechanisms for all interactions

## Implementing Accessibility in Your Prototype

Accessibility benefits all users and is crucial for professional design work:

1. **Colour and Contrast:**
   - Test your colour palette for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using Adobe XD's accessibility tools
   - Create alternative themes for users with different visual needs
   - Make sure information isn't conveyed by colour alone

2. **Navigation and Structure:**
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
   - Design clear focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Create logical tab order for all interactive elements

3. **Interaction Design:**
   - Provide multiple ways to complete key tasks
   - Design clear error states with helpful recovery options
   - Include options to adjust text size and reduce motion

## Over to You

Consider these questions as you approach your own prototyping work:

- How might you balance competing user needs without creating entirely separate interfaces?
- What specific components would benefit most from adaptive design based on user preferences?
- How would you test your prototype with diverse user groups?
- What metrics would you use to determine if your design successfully serves both demographics?

Try creating a simple prototype for a single banking function (like checking an account balance) that works well for both younger and older users. Share your approach in our next virtual meetup.

## Looking Ahead

Next, we'll explore "Developing Cross-Platform Solutions for Financial Services." This will build on this foundation by implementing responsive components in Figma, creating an accessible design system specifically for financial interfaces, and documenting iteration cycles based on user feedback. You'll learn techniques for prototyping micro-interactions that enhance usability for different user groups.

Changes made to improve accessibility for HND Graphic Design learners:

- Removed references to "module" and replaced with more direct language to avoid institutional terminology
- Added brief explanations for technical acronyms (WCAG, P2P) to support learners who may be unfamiliar with these terms
- Simplified the introduction and conclusion to be more direct and action-oriented
- Maintained the practical, career-focused approach that aligns with the learners' motivation to prepare for professional work
- Preserved all hands-on activities and visual learning elements that match the learners' preferred learning style
