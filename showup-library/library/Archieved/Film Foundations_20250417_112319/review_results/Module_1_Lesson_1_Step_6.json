You've provided detailed instructions and a learner profile, but the actual content that needs editing is missing from your message. There's a placeholder that mentions \"three versions of content\" and \"French Surrealism,\" but the actual text to be edited isn't included.\n\nTo proceed with making the requested minor edits, I would need you to share the specific learning content that requires revision. Once you provide that material, I can carefully review it and make targeted changes to improve accessibility for your first-year students at Open Window South Africa Higher Education.\n\nPlease share the content you'd like me to edit, and I'll be happy to help according to the guidelines you've outlined.",
