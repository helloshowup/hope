Instead, there's only a placeholder message indicating that the original content wasn't shared. Without the actual educational content to edit, I can't perform the requested task of making it more human-like and suitable for first-year creative arts students at Open Window South Africa.\n\nThe placeholder message itself contains some AI patterns like the use of \"ensure\" and a somewhat formulaic structure, but there's no substantial content about Soviet Montage to edit according to your requirements (removing \"essential,\" changing to British spelling, renaming reflection practices to \"Over to You,\" etc.).\n</Analysis>\n\nI notice there seems to be a technical issue - the actual content about Soviet Montage that needs editing wasn't included in your message. What I received was only a placeholder response explaining what would be done if content were provided, rather than the actual educational material that needs editing.\n\nIf you could share the original Soviet Montage content that needs to be made more human-like and accessible for first-year creative arts students, I'd be happy to apply all the requested changes:\n- Removing formulaic AI introductions\n- Changing American to British spelling\n- Replacing all instances of \"essential\" with more natural alternatives\n- Ensuring reflection practices are labeled as \"Over to You\"\n- Making the content more engaging and human-like for your Open Window students\n\nPlease share the content you'd like edited, and I'll apply these changes right away.",
