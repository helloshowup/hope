# Historical Film Movements 

I notice that you haven't provided the actual learning content that needs to be edited. Your message contains instructions for how I should approach the editing task and a detailed learner profile, but the content itself appears to be missing.

To complete this task as requested, I would need:

1. The actual learning material text that requires editing
2. Any specific concerns about the current content that you'd like addressed

Once you provide the content that needs editing, I can make the appropriate minor edits to improve accessibility for your first-year Open Window students while maintaining the core substance of the material.
