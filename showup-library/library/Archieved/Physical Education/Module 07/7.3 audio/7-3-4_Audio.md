The Accuracy Game takes your skills to the next level by challenging you to land objects precisely on targets rather than just hitting them. This activity is inspired by games like cornhole or beanbag toss that you might play at a backyard barbecue or school field day. The difference is in how we score - landing completely on target requires much more control than simply making contact.

What makes this game especially fun is how you can adjust the difficulty to match your skill level. If you're finding it too challenging, use larger targets or move closer. As you improve, try the harder options to push yourself. Remember that even professional athletes started as beginners - consistent practice is what transforms a novice into an expert!

**Setup:**
1. Place 3 paper plates or draw 3 circles (6-inch diameter) on the ground
2. Space them 1 foot apart in a triangle formation
3. Mark throwing positions at 3, 5, and 7 feet away

**Activity Steps:**
1. Throw 5 objects at each target (15 total throws)
2. Score as follows:
- Object lands completely on target = 3 points
- Object partially on target = 1 point
- Object touches but rolls off = 0 points
3. Record your score out of 45 possible points
4. Practice at each distance until you score at least 30 points
