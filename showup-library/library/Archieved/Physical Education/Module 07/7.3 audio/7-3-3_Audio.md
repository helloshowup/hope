Content to be covered:

The Target Challenge is similar to games you might have played at carnivals or fairs, where you aim at objects to win prizes. The difference is that you'll be tracking your improvement over time, which makes this both a game and a training exercise.

As you practice this activity, you'll notice that your brain starts to automatically calculate the right amount of force needed for different distances. This is called "motor learning" - your body is building muscle memory that will make these skills feel more natural over time. Don't get discouraged if you miss at first - even professional athletes practice these fundamentals regularly!

**Setup:**
1. Place 5 targets (bottles, boxes) in a row, spaced 6 inches apart
2. Mark throwing lines at 3, 6, and 9 feet from targets
3. Assign point values: closest targets = 1 point, middle targets = 3 points, farthest targets = 5 points

**Activity Steps:**
1. Start at the 3-foot line and throw 10 times, recording your score
2. Move to the 6-foot line when you can hit targets 7 out of 10 times
3. Move to the 9-foot line when you can hit targets 5 out of 10 times from 6 feet
4. Compare rolling versus pitching by doing 10 of each and recording scores

**Progress Tracking:**
Create a simple chart with columns for:

- Distance (3ft, 6ft, 9ft)
- Method (Roll, Pitch)
- Score (out of possible 50 points)
- Date
