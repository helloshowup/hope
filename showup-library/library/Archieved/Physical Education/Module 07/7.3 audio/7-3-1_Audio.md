Before we dive into the specific steps, let's understand why rolling is such an important skill. Whether you're playing bowling with friends or participating in lawn games at a family picnic, a good rolling technique helps you control both direction and speed. Many students find rolling easier to master than throwing, making it a great starting point for developing accuracy.

Think about rolling a ball like aiming a remote-controlled car - you need the right amount of power and the correct angle to reach your target. The technique we'll practice uses your whole body, not just your arms, to create a smooth, controlled motion that you can adjust based on distance and the object you're using.

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent
2. Hold your object (sock ball, soft ball) with both hands
3. Focus your eyes on your target
4. Swing the object back between your legs
5. Shift your weight to your back foot
6. Swing forward, releasing the object close to the ground
7. Follow through with your swing while keeping your eyes on the target
