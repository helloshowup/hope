Content to be covered:
The Knock-Down Challenge brings together everything you've learned about pitching and rolling in a game that's both fun and challenging. This activity is similar to bowling or carnival games where you knock down pins or bottles. The pyramid setup creates different levels of difficulty - the top bottle is harder to hit but knocking it down might help you take out others below it!

This game is perfect for seeing how your skills are improving over time. When you first start, you might need several throws to knock everything down. But as your accuracy and control improve, you'll find yourself clearing the pyramid in fewer attempts. Try challenging yourself to beat your previous record, or adapt the game by using different objects or distances to keep it interesting as your skills develop.

**Setup:**
1. Stack 6 empty plastic bottles or toilet paper rolls in a pyramid (3 on bottom, 2 in middle, 1 on top)
2. Mark throwing positions at 4, 7, and 10 feet away
3. Place a piece of tape on the floor as your boundary line

**Activity Steps:**
1. Start at the 4-foot line
2. Count how many throws it takes to knock down all items
3. Reset and try again, attempting to use fewer throws
4. Move back to the next distance when you can knock everything down in 3 or fewer throws
5. Record your best score at each distance
