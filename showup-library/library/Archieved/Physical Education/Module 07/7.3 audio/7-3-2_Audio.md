Script title: Underhand Pitching Steps

Content to be covered:
Underhand pitching is one of the most versatile throwing techniques you'll learn. It's the same motion used in softball pitching, horseshoes, and even when tossing a ball to a younger sibling or pet. The beauty of underhand pitching is how it combines accuracy with a gentle delivery - perfect for when you need control more than speed.

Unlike overhand throws that can be hard to aim, underhand pitching gives you excellent control over both direction and distance. Pay special attention to your follow-through - just like professional softball pitchers, pointing your hand toward your target after release helps guide the object exactly where you want it to go. With practice, you'll develop a natural feel for how much power to use for different distances.

For successful pitching:

1. Stand with your stronger foot slightly forward
2. Hold the object in your stronger hand
3. Keep your eyes locked on your target
4. Swing your arm back
5. Step forward with your opposite foot as you swing your arm forward
6. Release the object with a smooth motion
7. Follow through with your arm pointing toward the target

**Grip Testing Activity:**
1. Try three different grips on the same object:
- Loose grip: Hold with fingertips only
- Medium grip: Hold with fingers wrapped around
- Firm grip: Squeeze the object while throwing
2. Throw 5 times with each grip
3. Note which grip worked best for different objects
