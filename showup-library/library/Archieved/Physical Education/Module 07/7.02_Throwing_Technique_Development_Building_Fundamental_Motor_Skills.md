# 7.2  Throwing Technique Development: Building Fundamental Motor Skills

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Show the basic steps of a good throw
- Try three types of throws (overhand, underhand, and sidearm)
- Hit targets using the right throw for each task

## Materials Needed
- Open space (at least 10 feet long)
- Containers for targets (buckets, laundry baskets, cardboard boxes)
- Throwing objects (rolled socks, tennis balls, bean bags, small stuffed animals, foam balls)
- Paper plates or paper circles (for wall targets)
- Tape (for marking positions and securing targets)
- Small towel or mat (to mark throwing position)
- Paper and pencil (for tracking progress)
- Hoop or paper plate with string (for moving target)
- Pillow or towel (for soft landing area)

Throwing appears in countless sports and activities - from basketball to cricket to backyard games of catch. When you master proper throwing technique, you'll participate more confidently in physical activities and enjoy them more. This guide covers throwing mechanics, different throwing styles, and practical ways to improve your accuracy.

Before diving into specific techniques, it's important to understand that throwing is a full-body movement, not just an arm action. Think about how baseball players wind up their entire body before releasing a pitch, or how a basketball player uses their legs to add power to a chest pass. Your whole body works together to create an effective throw.

Learning proper throwing mechanics might feel awkward at first, especially if you've developed your own style over time. But with practice, these fundamental movements will become second nature, helping you throw with greater accuracy, distance, and less strain on your body. Let's break down the key elements of a good throw:

### Grip and Finger Placement

Finding the right grip is like choosing the right tool for a job - it sets you up for success before you even start the throwing motion.

- Spread your fingers across the back of the ball or object
- Position your thumb and index finger in a "V" shape
- Hold firmly but not too tightly - your hand shouldn't strain

### Stance and Body Position

Just like a house needs a solid foundation, your throw needs a stable starting position to generate power and accuracy.

- Place your feet shoulder-width apart
- Position your non-throwing side foot slightly forward
- Turn your non-throwing shoulder toward your target
- Keep knees slightly bent for balance

### Arm Motion and Follow-Through

The smooth path your arm takes during a throw is similar to how a whip creates speed - the energy travels from your body through your arm to the object.

- Position the ball near your ear for overhand throws
- Step toward your target with your front foot
- Move your throwing arm forward with your elbow at shoulder height
- Let go of the ball when your arm points at the target
- Continue your arm movement after release
- Your hand should finish near your opposite hip

### Weight Transfer

Think of weight transfer like a seesaw - as one side goes down, the other rises up, creating a natural flow of energy through your body.

- Move your weight from back foot to front foot during the throw
- This movement creates power in your throw

Just as a carpenter selects different tools for different jobs, athletes choose specific throwing styles based on their needs. In basketball, you might use an overhand throw for a long pass down the court, but switch to an underhand style when shooting a free throw. Each throwing technique has its own advantages and ideal situations.

As you practice these different throws, you'll start to develop an instinct for which one works best in different scenarios. Don't worry if some feel more natural than others at first - that's completely normal! With practice, you'll build confidence in all three styles and know exactly when to use each one. Here are some various throwing techniques you can use:

### Overhand Throw

The overhand throw is probably what comes to mind first when you think about throwing. It's the motion you see baseball pitchers use, with their arm arcing high above their shoulder before releasing the ball with power and precision. This technique gives you the most distance and speed, making it perfect for reaching targets that are far away. When you're playing catch with friends in the park or trying to throw a ball across a field, this is typically your go-to option. Used in baseball, cricket, and whenever you need distance.

- Hold the ball above your shoulder
- Step forward with your opposite foot (if you throw with your right hand, step with your left foot)
- Bring your arm forward quickly and release
- Keep your elbow high for maximum power

### Underhand Throw

The underhand throw might remind you of skipping stones across a pond or rolling a bowling ball down the lane. This gentle, sweeping motion starts low and follows a natural arc upward, making it easier to control exactly where your object will land. While it won't give you the same power as an overhand throw, it offers precision that's hard to match with other techniques. Perfect for short, accurate throws in bowling or rounders.

- Hold the ball below your waist
- Swing your arm forward in a smooth arc
- Release when your arm points at your target
- Focus on accuracy rather than power

### Sidearm Throw

The sidearm throw feels a bit like swinging a tennis racket horizontally across your body. Instead of going over or under, your arm moves parallel to the ground, creating a unique trajectory that can surprise opponents. This technique is particularly useful when you need to throw around obstacles or when you want to create a skipping effect, like when throwing a flat stone across water. Helpful when throwing around obstacles or in games like dodgeball.

- Hold the ball at waist height
- Swing your arm horizontally across your body
- Keep your elbow bent until release
- Practice regularly - this throw takes time to master

## Practicing Throws Indoors and Outdoors

You don't need a large field or gym to practice your throwing skills. With a little creativity, you can adapt your practice to fit any space, whether you're inside on a rainy day or outside in your backyard. The games from lesson 7.1 can be easily modified to help you develop your throwing techniques.

For indoor practice, Mini-Basketball is perfect for developing your accuracy with different throwing styles. Use rolled socks or a soft foam ball as your "basketball" and set up a laundry basket or cardboard box as your target. Try using all three throwing techniques we've learned - you might find that an underhand throw works best for close shots, while an overhand throw gives you better accuracy from farther away. Mark different shooting spots with tape to create varying levels of challenge.

Hallway Bowling can be adapted to practice your underhand throw technique. Set up toilet paper rolls or plastic bottles as pins at one end of your hallway, and use your underhand throw to roll a soft ball or sock bundle toward them. Focus on the smooth arc of your arm and consistent release point. For an extra challenge, try to knock down specific pins rather than all of them at once, which requires even greater precision.

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the last time you played a throwing game - which of the three throwing styles (overhand, underhand, or sidearm) did you naturally use, and why do you think that style felt most comfortable for that situation?
