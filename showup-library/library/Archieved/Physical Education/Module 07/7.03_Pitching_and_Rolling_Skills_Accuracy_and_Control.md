# 7.3 Pitching and Rolling Skills: Accuracy and Control

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Throw and roll objects with the right form
- Hit targets from short and long distances
- Make your own targets for practice at home

## Materials Needed

- Rolled-up socks (3-4 pairs for multiple throws)
- Small, soft balls (tennis balls, rubber balls)
- Bean bags or small stuffed animals
- Paper balls (made from crumpled newspaper covered with tape)
- Household items for targets (empty water bottles, cardboard boxes, paper plates)
- Blanket or towel (to stop rolling objects)
- Tape, socks, or other markers (to mark throwing positions)
- Practice journal or paper (for recording progress and reflections)
- Plastic bottles or toilet paper rolls (for pyramid stacking)

**Equipment Alternatives:**
- No bean bags? Fill a sock with rice or beans and tie it closed
- No paper plates? Cut circles from cardboard boxes or draw circles on newspaper

These pitching and rolling skills are fundamental to many sports - bowling, softball, cricket, and various target games. Think about how a baseball pitcher carefully aims for the strike zone, or how a bowler rolls with precision to knock down pins. These aren't just fun activities; they're building blocks for athletic development that you'll use throughout your life.

Mastering these skills will significantly improve your hand-eye coordination and spatial awareness. When you practice throwing and rolling with accuracy, you're training your brain to judge distances better and coordinate your movements more precisely. These abilities will help you not just in PE class, but in everyday activities like catching a falling object or even playing video games that require quick reactions!

Before we dive into the specific steps, let's understand why rolling is such an important skill. Whether you're playing bowling with friends or participating in lawn games at a family picnic, a good rolling technique helps you control both direction and speed. Many students find rolling easier to master than throwing, making it a great starting point for developing accuracy.

Think about rolling a ball like aiming a remote-controlled car - you need the right amount of power and the correct angle to reach your target. The technique we'll practice uses your whole body, not just your arms, to create a smooth, controlled motion that you can adjust based on distance and the object you're using.

<br/>
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent
2. Hold your object (sock ball, soft ball) with both hands
3. Focus your eyes on your target
4. Swing the object back between your legs
5. Shift your weight to your back foot
6. Swing forward, releasing the object close to the ground
7. Follow through with your swing while keeping your eyes on the target

**Object Testing Activity:**
1. Roll three different objects (sock ball, tennis ball, paper ball) toward a target
2. Roll each object 5 times
3. Record which object rolled straightest and which was easiest to control
4. Note how the weight affected direction and speed in your practice journal

**Troubleshooting Common Problems:**
- Ball curves to the right: Try releasing with both hands exactly at the same time
- Ball bounces too much: Release closer to the ground
- Not enough power: Bend knees more and use a fuller backswing

## Underhand Pitching Technique

---audioinstructionsEND---

Underhand pitching is one of the most versatile throwing techniques you'll learn. It's the same motion used in softball pitching, horseshoes, and even when tossing a ball to a younger sibling or pet. The beauty of underhand pitching is how it combines accuracy with a gentle delivery - perfect for when you need control more than speed.

Unlike overhand throws that can be hard to aim, underhand pitching gives you excellent control over both direction and distance. Pay special attention to your follow-through - just like professional softball pitchers, pointing your hand toward your target after release helps guide the object exactly where you want it to go. With practice, you'll develop a natural feel for how much power to use for different distances.

For successful pitching:

<br/>
1. Stand with your stronger foot slightly forward
2. Hold the object in your stronger hand
3. Keep your eyes locked on your target
4. Swing your arm back
5. Step forward with your opposite foot as you swing your arm forward
6. Release the object with a smooth motion
7. Follow through with your arm pointing toward the target

**Grip Testing Activity:**
1. Try three different grips on the same object:

- Loose grip: Hold with fingertips only
- Medium grip: Hold with fingers wrapped around
- Firm grip: Squeeze the object while throwing
2. Throw 5 times with each grip
3. Record which grip gave you the most accuracy
4. Note which grip worked best for different objects

**Troubleshooting Common Problems:**
- Throws going too high: Lower your release point
- Not enough power: Step forward more deliberately
- Poor accuracy: Keep your eyes fixed on the target throughout the entire throw

### Target Challenge

Now that you've learned the basic techniques, it's time to put them into practice with some fun challenges! The Target Challenge is similar to games you might have played at carnivals or fairs, where you aim at objects to win prizes. The difference is that you'll be tracking your improvement over time, which makes this both a game and a training exercise.

As you practice this activity, you'll notice that your brain starts to automatically calculate the right amount of force needed for different distances. This is called "motor learning" - your body is building muscle memory that will make these skills feel more natural over time. Don't get discouraged if you miss at first - even professional athletes practice these fundamentals regularly!

**Setup:**
1. Place 5 targets (bottles, boxes) in a row, spaced 6 inches apart
2. Mark throwing lines at 3, 6, and 9 feet from targets
3. Assign point values: closest targets = 1 point, middle targets = 3 points, farthest targets = 5 points

**Activity Steps:**
1. Start at the 3-foot line and throw 10 times, recording your score
2. Move to the 6-foot line when you can hit targets 7 out of 10 times
3. Move to the 9-foot line when you can hit targets 5 out of 10 times from 6 feet
4. Compare rolling versus pitching by doing 10 of each and recording scores

**Progress Tracking:**
Create a simple chart with columns for:

- Distance (3ft, 6ft, 9ft)
- Method (Roll, Pitch)
- Score (out of possible 50 points)
- Date

### Accuracy Game

---audioinstructionsEND---

The Accuracy Game takes your skills to the next level by challenging you to land objects precisely on targets rather than just hitting them. This activity is inspired by games like cornhole or beanbag toss that you might play at a backyard barbecue or school field day. The difference is in how we score - landing completely on target requires much more control than simply making contact.

What makes this game especially fun is how you can adjust the difficulty to match your skill level. If you're finding it too challenging, use larger targets or move closer. As you improve, try the harder options to push yourself. Remember that even professional athletes started as beginners - consistent practice is what transforms a novice into an expert!

**Setup:**
1. Place 3 paper plates or draw 3 circles (6-inch diameter) on the ground
2. Space them 1 foot apart in a triangle formation
3. Mark throwing positions at 3, 5, and 7 feet away

**Activity Steps:**
1. Throw 5 objects at each target (15 total throws)
2. Score as follows:

- Object lands completely on target = 3 points
- Object partially on target = 1 point
- Object touches but rolls off = 0 points
3. Record your score out of 45 possible points
4. Practice at each distance until you score at least 30 points

**Difficulty Options:**
- Easier: Use larger targets or move closer
- Harder: Use smaller targets or stand on one foot while throwing

### Knock-Down Challenge

The Knock-Down Challenge brings together everything you've learned about pitching and rolling in a game that's both fun and challenging. This activity is similar to bowling or carnival games where you knock down pins or bottles. The pyramid setup creates different levels of difficulty - the top bottle is harder to hit but knocking it down might help you take out others below it!

This game is perfect for seeing how your skills are improving over time. When you first start, you might need several throws to knock everything down. But as your accuracy and control improve, you'll find yourself clearing the pyramid in fewer attempts. Try challenging yourself to beat your previous record, or adapt the game by using different objects or distances to keep it interesting as your skills develop.

**Setup:**
1. Stack 6 empty plastic bottles or toilet paper rolls in a pyramid (3 on bottom, 2 in middle, 1 on top)
2. Mark throwing positions at 4, 7, and 10 feet away
3. Place a piece of tape on the floor as your boundary line

**Activity Steps:**
1. Start at the 4-foot line
2. Count how many throws it takes to knock down all items
3. Reset and try again, attempting to use fewer throws
4. Move back to the next distance when you can knock everything down in 3 or fewer throws
5. Record your best score at each distance

**Troubleshooting:**
- If items won't stay stacked, place them on a book or tray
- If objects roll away too far, set up against a wall
- If you're struggling with accuracy, focus on hitting the bottom row first
