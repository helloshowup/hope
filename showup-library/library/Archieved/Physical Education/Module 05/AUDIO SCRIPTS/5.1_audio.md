Script title: How to Sort Foods by Nutrients activity guide
File name: 5-1-1.mp3
Content to be covered:
### Setup Instructions:
1. Clear a space on a table or floor where you can sort food items
2. Gather 10-15 food items from your kitchen (or food packaging, or printed pictures of foods)
3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready to record your findings
4. Optional: Have a device ready to look up nutrition information

### Activity Steps:
1. Draw three circles on your paper and label them "Mainly Carbs," "Mainly Protein," and "Mainly Fats"
2. Pick up each food item one by one and decide which group it belongs in
3. Place the item (or its name) in the appropriate circle
4. For mixed foods like pizza or sandwiches, think about the main ingredient (pizza crust is mainly carbs)
5. After sorting all items, check your answers using:

- Food package labels (look at which nutrient has the highest grams)
- An online food database like MyFitnessPal or the USDA Food Database
- A food guide chart (included below)

### Example of Completed Activity:

- Mainly Carbs: Apple, bread, rice, pasta, potato, banana
- Mainly Protein: Chicken, eggs, tuna, tofu, Greek yogurt
- Mainly Fats: Olive oil, butter, avocado, nuts, cheese

Don't worry if you get stuck during this activity â€“ even nutrition scientists sometimes debate about how to classify certain foods! Many of the foods we eat daily are combinations of different nutrients. For example, whole milk contains both protein and fat, while beans have both protein and carbs. If you're unsure, try looking at the food label or asking an adult at home. Remember, the goal isn't to get everything perfectly right, but to start thinking about what's in your food and how it helps your body.

- Can't decide where a food belongs? Many foods contain multiple nutrients. Place it between circles or in the group with its highest nutrient content.
- No food items available? Use food packaging, draw foods, or print pictures from the internet.
- Not sure about a food's nutrients? Look at the Nutrition Facts label - the nutrient with the highest grams is usually the main type.
