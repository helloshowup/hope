# 5.3 Fuelling Your Body for Physical Activity

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Show how the MyPlate model helps you eat a mix of good foods
- Pick snacks that give you energy before you play or work out
- Choose foods that help your body feel better after being active

## Materials Needed

- Two similar snack items with nutrition labels (or access to online images of nutrition labels)
- Paper and pencil or digital note-taking app
- Drawing supplies (pencil, markers, or crayons)

Your body works hard during physical activity. The foods you eat before playing basketball, running in PE class, or riding bikes with friends affect both how well you perform and how you feel afterward. Eating the right foods at the right times gives you energy to play longer, helps build stronger muscles, and speeds up how quickly you recover.

## The MyPlate Model

Have you ever wondered what a perfectly balanced meal looks like? The MyPlate model gives us a simple picture to follow. Think of it as a food map that shows you how to fill your plate at each meal. The colorful design divides your plate into sections - kind of like pizza slices - showing how much space each food group should take up. This isn't just something adults made up - it's based on what scientists have learned about keeping our bodies healthy and strong, especially when we're active and growing.

<br/>
Let's look at what goes on your plate:

- **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and berries provide quick energy and important vitamins
- **Vegetables**: Carrots, broccoli, and spinach contain minerals and vitamins that keep your body working properly
- **Grains**: Bread, pasta, and rice fuel your activities with long-lasting energy (brown and whole grain versions work best)
- **Protein**: Chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts help repair and build your muscles
- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain calcium that strengthens your bones

When you include foods from each group in your meals, your body gets all the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and active.

## Pre-Workout Snacks

Think of your body like a car that needs gas before a long trip. Without fuel in the tank, you might run out of energy halfway through your game or workout. But not all snacks work the same way! Some give you a quick burst of energy that disappears fast (like eating candy), while others provide steady energy that lasts through your whole activity. The best pre-workout snacks combine both quick and long-lasting energy sources, without being so big that they make your stomach feel heavy when you move around.

<br/>
Eating a small snack 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body fuel to perform well. Try these pre-workout snacks:

- **Banana with peanut butter**: Bananas provide quick energy while peanut butter adds protein that helps that energy last
- **Apple slices with cheese**: The fruit gives immediate energy while cheese adds staying power
- **Yogurt with berries**: This combination digests easily and provides both quick and sustained energy
- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These complex carbohydrates release energy steadily during your activity

Keep your pre-workout snack small - just enough to fuel you without feeling heavy in your stomach. If you eat too much right before exercise, you might feel uncomfortable or get a stomach ache.

## Post-Workout Refuelling

After you finish playing sports or exercising, your body is kind of like a construction site. All that running, jumping, and moving creates tiny tears in your muscles (don't worry - this is normal!). Your body needs the right building materials to repair these tears, which actually makes your muscles stronger than before. That's why what you eat after exercise matters so much.

<br/>
The 30-minute window right after activity is super important - scientists call it the "recovery window" because your body is extra good at absorbing nutrients during this time. It's like your muscles have special doors that open wide right after exercise, making it easier for good nutrients to get inside and help with repairs.

<br/>
Your body needs specific nutrients after exercise to recover properly. Eating within 30 minutes after finishing activity helps your muscles rebuild stronger. Good recovery foods include:

- **Chocolate milk**: This tasty drink contains an excellent ratio of carbohydrates to protein that helps muscles recover
- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The lean meat repairs muscle tissue while the wrap replenishes energy stores
- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Blending these ingredients creates an easy-to-digest mix of proteins and carbs
- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: This Middle Eastern combo provides plant protein and energy-restoring carbohydrates

Drink plenty of water after sweating! Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster and prevents dehydration, which can cause headaches and tiredness.

## Reading Food Labels

Have you ever picked up a food package and wondered what all those numbers and percentages really mean? Food labels are like secret codes that tell you exactly what's inside your snacks and meals. Learning to crack this code is a super useful skill - almost like having X-ray vision at the grocery store! Instead of just trusting what the front of the package says ("Super Healthy!" or "Energy Boost!"), the nutrition label on the back tells the real story.

<br/>
Many foods that seem healthy might actually be packed with added sugars or unhealthy fats. For example, some granola bars have almost as much sugar as a candy bar! By knowing how to read labels, you can compare similar foods and make better choices for your active body.

<br/>
Understanding food labels helps you make smarter food choices. Here's what to look for:

- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)
- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body
- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair
- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones
- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources
- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed
