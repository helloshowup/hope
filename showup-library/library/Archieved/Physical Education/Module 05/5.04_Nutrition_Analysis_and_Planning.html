<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track what you eat for one day and sort foods into groups</li>
<li>Create a SMART goal to make one food choice better</li>
<li>Make a plan to beat common eating hurdles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nutrition tracking worksheet (printable PDF or create your own using notebook paper)</li>
<li>Pen or pencil</li>
<li>Timer or phone/clock for meal timing</li>
<li>Optional: smartphone for taking pictures of meals</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've learned about food groups and nutrition basics, we'll take a closer look at YOUR personal eating habits and develop nutrition goals that will boost your energy and help you feel great!</p>
<p><strong>Setup Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>1\ Print the nutrition tracking worksheet or create a simple table in your notebook with columns for: Time, Food/Drink, Amount, Food Group, and How I Felt<br />
2\ Keep your tracking sheet somewhere easily accessible (like on the refrigerator or in your backpack)<br />
3\ Set reminders on your phone or place sticky notes where you'll see them to help you remember to record meals</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Food Tracking (1 day)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Record everything you eat and drink for ONE day on your tracking sheet</li>
<li>For each item, write down:</li>
<li>WHAT you ate (be specific - "turkey sandwich with cheese and lettuce" not just "sandwich")</li>
<li>WHEN you ate it (actual time)</li>
<li>HOW MUCH you ate (example: 1 cup, 2 slices, 1 medium apple)</li>
<li>HOW you felt afterward (energized, tired, still hungry, satisfied, etc.)</li>
<li>Take pictures of your meals if that helps you remember details</li>
<li>If you forget to record something, add it as soon as you remember</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Food Group Analysis</strong><br />
- After your tracking day, review your food log and follow these steps:<br />
  1\ Label each food item with its MyPlate group: Fruits (F), Vegetables (V), Grains (G), Protein (P), Dairy (D), or Other (O)<br />
  2\ Count how many servings you had from each group and record the totals<br />
  3. Compare your totals to these daily targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruits: 1.5-2 cups</li>
<li>Vegetables: 2-3 cups</li>
<li>Grains: 5-7 ounces (at least half should be whole grains)</li>
<li>Protein: 5-6 ounces</li>
<li>Dairy: 3 cups<br />
  4\ Highlight or circle foods that gave you energy<br />
  5\ Put an X next to foods that made you feel tired or sluggish</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example of Completed Food Tracking:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Time: 7:30am | Food/Drink: Bowl of cereal with milk and banana | Amount: 1 cup cereal, Â½ cup milk, 1 medium banana | Food Groups: G, D, F | How I Felt: Energized until about 10am
Time: 10:15am | Food/Drink: Chocolate chip granola bar | Amount: 1 bar | Food Groups: G, O | How I Felt: Quick energy but hungry again by 11:30
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Goal Setting</strong><br />
- Look at your food group analysis and identify ONE specific area that needs improvement. Examples:<br />
  - Not enough vegetables<br />
  - Too many sugary snacks<br />
  - Skipping breakfast<br />
  - Not drinking enough water<br />
- Complete the "SMART Goal Builder" section on your worksheet by filling in each part:<br />
  - Specific: Exactly what will you do?<br />
  - Measurable: How will you track it?<br />
  - Achievable: Is this realistic for your situation?<br />
  - Relevant: How will this help your health?<br />
  - Time-bound: When will you start/finish?<br />
- Examples of strong SMART goals:<br />
  - "I will add a fruit or vegetable to my after-school snack at least 4 days this week"<br />
  - "I will replace my sugary breakfast cereal with oatmeal topped with fruit 3 mornings this week"<br />
  - "I will fill my water bottle each morning and finish it before lunch, then refill and finish before dinner"<br />
- Weak goals to avoid:<br />
  - "I will eat healthier" (too general)<br />
  - "I will never eat junk food again" (not realistic)<br />
  - "I will eat 10 vegetables every day" (too ambitious to start)</p>
<h2>Common Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<p>Making changes to your eating habits isn't always easy. Most students run into a few bumps along the way, and that's totally normal! Think of these challenges like hurdles in a race - with the right technique, you can jump right over them. The key is to spot these hurdles before they trip you up and have a game plan ready.</p>
<p><br/><br />
Your daily routine probably already feels pretty packed with school, homework, activities, and hanging out with friends. Adding new food habits might seem impossible at first. But remember, small changes can make a big difference! The solutions below come from real middle schoolers who found ways to eat better even with busy schedules, limited cooking skills, and other everyday challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge: No time because of homework and activities</strong><br />
- <strong>Practical Solution:</strong> Sunday prep session - spend 15 minutes washing and cutting fruits and vegetables, then store in containers in the refrigerator<br />
- <strong>Quick Grab Options:</strong> <br />
  - Pre-portion trail mix into small containers or bags<br />
  - Stock your backpack with fruit that doesn't need refrigeration (apples, bananas)<br />
  - Keep single-serve nut butter packets to pair with crackers or fruit</p>
<p><strong>Challenge: Limited access to kitchen or cooking tools</strong><br />
- <strong>No-Cook Meal Ideas:</strong><br />
  - Sandwich wrap: tortilla + lunch meat + cheese + lettuce (roll up and eat)<br />
  - Protein box: hard-boiled eggs + cheese cubes + crackers + carrot sticks<br />
  - Breakfast parfait: layer yogurt + cereal + berries in a cup<br />
- <strong>Kitchen Tools for Beginners:</strong><br />
  - If you can use a microwave: Learn to make scrambled eggs in a mug, instant oatmeal with fruit, or microwave baked potato<br />
  - If you can use a toaster: Try whole grain toast with avocado, peanut butter and banana, or melted cheese</p>
<p><strong>Challenge: Weather keeps you inside</strong><br />
- <strong>Indoor Movement Ideas:</strong><br />
  - Create a 5-minute workout routine (10 jumping jacks, 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups, repeat)<br />
  - Follow along with a YouTube exercise video appropriate for your space<br />
  - Walk up and down stairs for 5 minutes<br />
- <strong>Brain-Boosting Indoor Day Foods:</strong><br />
  - Make a smoothie with yogurt, frozen berries, and spinach (the spinach taste disappears!)<br />
  - Try a warm bowl of oatmeal with walnuts and cinnamon<br />
  - Snack on oranges or bell peppers (high in vitamin C for immune support)</p>
<p><strong>Challenge: Just not feeling motivated</strong><br />
- <strong>Motivation Boosters:</strong><br />
  - Create a "foods I've tried" checklist and give yourself a non-food reward after trying 5 new healthy foods<br />
  - Start a simple journal noting how different foods affect your energy for activities you enjoy<br />
  - Take "before and after" photos of healthy meals you prepare<br />
  - Use a simple star chart and give yourself a star each day you meet your nutrition goal</p>

            <p><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Have you noticed how certain foods make you feel throughout the day? Think about a time when you felt really energetic after eating something, or when you felt tired or sluggish after a meal. What might this tell you about how food affects your body?</p>

<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p>Now that you've set your SMART goal, let's turn it into reality with a clear plan!</p>
<p><br/><br />
1. Complete your "Nutrition Action Plan" worksheet with these specific sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your SMART goal at the top</li>
<li>List these 3 concrete steps with specific details:</li>
<li>Step 1: What I'll do tomorrow (be specific)</li>
<li>Step 2: What I'll do in 3 days</li>
<li>Step 3: What I'll do in 1 week</li>
<li>Support person: Write the name of someone who can help (parent, sibling, friend) and exactly how they can help (examples: "Mom can buy fruits when shopping" or "Brother can remind me to pack my snack")</li>
<li>Progress tracking: Choose ONE of these methods:</li>
<li>Draw a simple chart with days of the week and check off when you meet your goal</li>
<li>Use a notes app on your phone to record daily progress</li>
<li>Take daily photos of meals that match your goal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example of a Completed Action Plan:</strong></p>
<pre><code>SMART Goal: I will include a vegetable with dinner at least 5 days this week.
&lt;br/&gt;
Step 1 (Tomorrow): I will ask my dad to include carrots with dinner tomorrow night.
Step 2 (In 3 days): I will learn how to microwave frozen broccoli to add to my plate.
Step 3 (In 1 week): I will try one new vegetable that I haven't eaten before.
&lt;br/&gt;
Support person: Dad can help by making sure we have vegetables in the house.
&lt;br/&gt;
Progress tracking: I will put a star on the kitchen calendar each day I eat a vegetable with dinner.
&lt;br/&gt;
Potential roadblock: We might order pizza one night.
Solution: I will ask for a side salad or add some carrot sticks to my meal.
