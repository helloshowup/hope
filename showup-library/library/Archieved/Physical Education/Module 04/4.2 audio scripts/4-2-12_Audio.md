Content to be covered:
Squats are one of the most functional exercises you can do because they mimic the movement of sitting down and standing up that we use throughout our daily lives.

**Squats**: 
  - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
  - Extend arms forward for balance if needed
  - Bend knees and push hips back as if sitting in a chair
  - Lower until thighs are parallel to floor (or as far as comfortable)
  - Push through heels to stand back up
  - Complete 10-15 repetitions
  - **Success check**: Knees should track over toes without collapsing inward
  - **Modification**: Use a chair behind you as a depth guide or support
