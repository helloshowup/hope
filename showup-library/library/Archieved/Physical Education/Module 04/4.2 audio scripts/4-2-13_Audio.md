Lunges are excellent for building leg strength while also improving your balance and coordination through controlled movement.

**Lunges**: 
  - Stand with feet hip-width apart
  - Step forward with right foot
  - Lower your body until both knees form 90-degree angles
  - Front knee should be over ankle, back knee hovering above floor
  - Push through front heel to return to standing
  - Alternate legs, completing 6-8 repetitions per leg
  - **Success check**: Your torso stays upright throughout the movement
  - **Modification**: Hold onto a chair or wall for balance if needed
