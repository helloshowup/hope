Content to be covered:
Calf raises target the muscles in the back of your lower legs that help you push off the ground when walking, running, or jumping.

**Calf Raises**: 
  - Stand with feet hip-width apart near a wall or chair for balance if needed
  - Rise onto your toes as high as possible
  - Lower heels back to floor with control
  - Complete 15-20 repetitions
  - **Success check**: Movement should be controlled, not bouncy
  - **Challenge option**: Try single-leg calf raises once double-leg becomes easy
