Content to be covered:
Shoulder taps are a great exercise that not only works your shoulders but also challenges your core stability as you balance in the position.

**Shoulder Taps**: 
  - Begin in a modified push-up position (on knees for beginners, full position for advanced)
  - Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees/feet
  - Lift one hand to tap the opposite shoulder while keeping hips steady
  - Return hand to floor and repeat with other hand
  - Complete 5 taps per side for beginners, 10-15 for advanced
  - **Success check**: Your hips shouldn't twist or rock side-to-side during taps
  - **Troubleshooting**: If your hips rotate, widen your hand position or try the knee version
