   - Roll your shoulders forward 5 times in complete circles

Now let's move to your neck, which often gets stiff from looking down at phones or tablets. This stretch can be done sitting or standing, making it perfect for when you need a quick break during homework time. If you ever feel dizzy during this stretch, stop and return to the center position.

2. **Neck Stretch:**
   - Stand or sit with a straight back
   - Slowly tilt your head toward your right shoulder until you feel a gentle stretch
   - Hold for 15 seconds while breathing normally
   - Return to center, then tilt toward your left shoulder
   - Success check: You should feel a gentle pull along the side of your neck without pain

Next up is the hamstring stretch, which helps the muscles in the back of your legs. Many kids have tight hamstrings from sitting a lot or from growth spurts. Don't worry if you can't reach your toes - just reach as far as is comfortable for you. The stretch happens in your leg, not in how far your hands go!

3. **Hamstring Stretch:**
   - Sit on your mat with your right leg extended straight, toes pointing up
   - Bend your left leg so your left foot touches your right inner thigh
   - Keeping your back straight (not rounded), reach toward your right toes
   - Hold where you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh for 15-30 seconds
   - Switch legs and repeat
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in the back of your thigh, not your lower back

Script title: Quadriceps Stretch
File name: 4-3-4.mp3
Content to be covered:
The quadriceps stretch works the front of your thighs - these are the big muscles you use when climbing stairs or riding a bike. If balancing is hard for you, it's totally fine to hold onto something sturdy like a chair, wall, or even a doorframe. Remember, good balance takes practice, so don't get frustrated if you wobble at first!

4. **Quadriceps Stretch:**
   - Stand next to a wall or chair for support
   - Balance on your left leg, using the support if needed
   - Bend your right knee and grab your right ankle with your right hand
   - Gently pull your heel toward your buttocks
   - Keep your knees close together and stand tall
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in the front of your thigh

Script title: Calf Stretch
File name: 4-3-5.mp3
Content to be covered:
This calf stretch is super important if you play sports or do activities that involve running and jumping. If you don't have a wall available, you can also do this stretch on a step (like at the bottom of a staircase) by letting your heel hang off the edge. Just make sure you have something to hold onto for safety!

5. **Calf Stretch:**
   - Face a wall and place your hands on it at shoulder height
   - Step back with your right foot, keeping it flat on the floor
   - Bend your left knee slightly while keeping your right leg straight
   - Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your right calf
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in your calf muscle, not your Achilles tendon (the cord just above your heel)

Script title: Side Stretch
File name: 4-3-6.mp3

Our final stretch targets the sides of your body, which often get overlooked but are important for twisting movements in sports and everyday activities. This stretch feels especially good after sitting for a long time. If you have limited space, you can do this stretch sitting on the edge of your bed or a chair.

6. **Side Stretch:**
   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Raise your right arm overhead
   - Lean your upper body to the left until you feel a stretch along your right side
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch sides
   - Success check: You should feel a smooth stretch along your side without twisting forward or backward
