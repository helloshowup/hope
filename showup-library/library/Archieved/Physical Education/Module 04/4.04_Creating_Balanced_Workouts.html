        <h1 style="color: #920205;">4.4 Creating Balanced Workouts: Design Your Own Exercise Routine</h1>
<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:<br />
- Explain why each part of a workout keeps you safe and healthy<br />
- Show how to do five basic exercises that build strength<br />
- Create your own 15-minute workout plan that you can do at home</p>
<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clear space (about 6 feet by 6 feet)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting Up Your Home Workout Space</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">Before starting, prepare your workout area:<br />
- Clear a space about 6 feet by 6 feet (about the size of a bathroom)<br />
- Make sure the floor is non-slippery<br />
- Have water nearby for hydration<br />
- Wear comfortable clothes that let you move freely<br />
- Remove any objects that could cause injury if you bump into them</p>
<p style="color: #920205;">If space is limited, focus on exercises that can be done in place rather than those requiring movement across a room.<br />
Before starting, prepare your workout area:<br />
- Clear a space about 6 feet by 6 feet (about the size of a bathroom)<br />
- Make sure the floor is non-slippery (use a yoga mat or towel if needed)<br />
- Have water nearby for hydration<br />
- Wear comfortable clothes that let you move freely<br />
- Remove any objects that could cause injury if you bump into them</p>
<p style="color: #920205;">If space is limited, focus on exercises that can be done in place rather than those requiring movement across a room.</p>
<h2>Warm-Up</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">Your body needs time to prepare for exercise. A good warm-up:<br />
- Raises your heart rate with light movement like jogging in place, jumping jacks, or dancing<br />
- Wakes up your muscles with arm circles, leg swings, and gentle twists<br />
- Gets your joints ready with ankle rotations and knee lifts<br />
- Takes about 3-5 minutes and involves your whole body</p>
<p style="color: #920205;">Skipping warm-ups often leads to injuries. Those few minutes make the rest of your workout safer and more effective.</p>
<p style="color: #920205;"><strong>Warm-Up Activity</strong>: Complete this 3-minute sequence to prepare your body:<br />
1\ March in place for 30 seconds<br />
2\ Do 10 arm circles forward and 10 backward<br />
3\ Perform 10 knee lifts on each leg<br />
4\ Do 10 ankle rotations on each foot<br />
5\ Finish with 30 seconds of jumping jacks or marching in place</p>
<h2>Strength Training</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">Strength training builds muscle power and is essential for a balanced workout. Regular strength training improves posture, increases strength, and helps your body use energy better. Here are some exercises you can do without equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Push-ups (regular or on your knees)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Squats (lowering your body as if sitting down)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Lunges (stepping forward with bent knees)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Plank holds (maintaining a straight body position)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Superman lifts (raising arms and legs while lying on your stomach)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Do 2 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise. Rest 30-60 seconds between sets. </p>
<p><strong>Exercise Modifications:</strong><br />
- If push-ups are too difficult: Do them against a wall or with knees on the floor<br />
- If squats hurt your knees: Don't go as deep or hold onto a chair for support<br />
- If balance is challenging during lunges: Keep one hand on a wall or chair<br />
- If plank is too hard: Hold the position for shorter time or use your knees<br />
- If Superman hurts your back: Lift just arms or just legs, not both together</p>
<p><strong>Strength Training Activity</strong>: Choose 3 exercises from the list. Perform 2 sets of each with appropriate rest. Record which version you did and how many repetitions you completed.</p>
<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p>Stretching maintains healthy muscles and joints while improving everyday movement. When you stretch:<br />
- Hold each stretch 20-30 seconds without bouncing<br />
- Keep breathing deeply<br />
- Feel a gentle stretch, never pain</p>
<p>Try these basic stretches:<br />
- Hamstring stretch (seated toe reach)<br />
- Quad stretch (standing, pulling foot toward buttocks)<br />
- Butterfly stretch (seated with feet together)<br />
- Shoulder stretch (arm across chest)<br />
- Child's pose (kneeling forward reach)</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting Common Stretching Problems:</strong><br />
- If you can't reach your toes: Bend your knees slightly or reach for your shins instead<br />
- If you can't balance during standing stretches: Hold onto a wall or chair<br />
- If your muscles shake: Back off slightly until the shaking stops<br />
- If you feel pain (not just stretching): Stop and try a different stretch</p>
<h2>Cool-Down</h2>
<p>A proper cool-down gradually returns your body to its resting state. Stopping exercise suddenly can make you dizzy or lightheaded. Your cool-down should include:<br />
- Slow walking or gentle marching<br />
- Deep breathing (inhale through nose, exhale through mouth)<br />
- Light stretching for tight muscles<br />
- A moment to check in with how your body feels</p>
<p><strong>Cool-Down Activity</strong>: After your workout, spend 3 minutes doing the following:<br />
1\ Walk slowly in place for 1 minute<br />
2\ Take 5 deep breaths while raising arms up and down<br />
3\ Stretch any muscles that feel tight, holding each stretch for 20 seconds<br />
4\ Stand still and notice how your body feels different from before the workout</p>
<h2>Sample Workout for Beginners</h2>
<p>Now that you understand each component, here's a complete workout you can try at home:</p>
<p><strong>Warm-Up (5 minutes)</strong><br />
- 1 minute: March in place<br />
- 1 minute: Arm circles (forward and backward)<br />

- 2 sets of 10 lunges (5 each leg, rest 30 seconds between sets)<br />
- 2 sets of 20-second plank holds (rest 30 seconds between sets)</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility (5 minutes)</strong><br />
- Hamstring stretch (30 seconds each leg)<br />
- Quad stretch (30 seconds each leg)<br />
- Shoulder stretch (30 seconds each arm)<br />
- Lower back stretch (30 seconds)</p>
<p><strong>Cool-Down (3 minutes)</strong><br />

<h2>Design Your Own Workout</h2>
<p>Taking what you've learned, it's time to create your own 15-minute workout. Follow these steps:<br />
INSERT FILE </p>
<p>1\ Choose 2-3 warm-up activities (total 3-5 minutes)<br />
2\ Select 3 strength exercises (total 5-7 minutes)<br />
3\ Pick 2-3 stretches for flexibility (total 3-5 minutes)<br />
4\ Plan a 2-minute cool-down</p>
<p><strong>Example of a Completed Workout Plan:</strong></p>
<pre><code>MY 15-MINUTE WORKOUT
Warm-Up (4 minutes):
- Marching in place (1 minute)
- Arm circles (1 minute)
- Knee lifts (1 minute)
- Jumping jacks (1 minute)
Strength (7 minutes):
- Push-ups against wall: 2 sets of 10
- Squats holding onto chair: 2 sets of 12
- Superman lifts (arms only): 2 sets of 10
Flexibility (3 minutes):
- Hamstring stretch (30 seconds each leg)
- Shoulder stretch (30 seconds each arm)
- Child's pose (30 seconds)
Cool-Down (2 minutes):
- Walking in place (1 minute)
- Deep breathing (1 minute)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Your Turn</strong>: Use the template to design your own 15-minute workout. Include all four components (warm-up, strength, flexibility, cool-down). If you need equipment alternatives, try:<br />
- Water bottles or canned food instead of weights<br />
- A sturdy chair for balance support<br />
- A towel instead of a yoga mat<br />
- Stairs for step-ups<br />
- A backpack with books for added resistance</p>

            <p><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Think about the physical activities you already enjoy doing, like playing sports, riding bikes, or dancing. How do those activities include some of the four workout components we've learned about (warm-up, strength, flexibility, and cool-down)? Which components might be missing from your favorite activities?</p>
