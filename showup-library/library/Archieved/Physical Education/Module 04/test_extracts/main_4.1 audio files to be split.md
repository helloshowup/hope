Script title: Understanding Major Muscle Groups
File name: 4-1-1.mp3
Content to be covered:
Your body contains more than 600 muscles, but we'll focus on six main groups that handle most movements:

1. **Arms**: Your biceps run along the front of your upper arm while your triceps cover the back. Bend your arm and feel your biceps tighten. Now straighten it and notice your triceps activate instead.

2. **Shoulders**: Your deltoids form a cap over the top of each shoulder. These muscles lift your arms forward, sideways, and backward.

3. **Chest**: Your pectoral muscles span across your chest. They activate when you push a door open or do a push-up.

4. **Back**: Your latissimus dorsi spread across your back like wings. These muscles work when you pull a door closed or do a pull-up.

5. **Core**: Your abdominal muscles in front and lower back muscles behind stabilize your body, help you bend, and protect your spine.

6. **Legs**: Your quadriceps cover the front of your thighs, hamstrings run along the back, and calf muscles power your lower legs. These muscles carry you everywhere you go.

Script title: How to Perform Push-Ups Safely
File name: 4-1-4.mp3
Content to be covered:
**What you'll need:**
- A clear space about 6 feet long and 3 feet wide
- A timer or clock with a second hand
- A wall for modified push-ups (if needed)
- A towel or exercise mat (optional)

**Setup instructions:**
1. Clear the space of any objects that might get in your way
2. Place your mat or towel on the floor if you're using one
3. Set your timer nearby where you can easily see it

**Activity steps:**
1. Choose the push-up version that matches your current ability:
   - **Level 1 (Beginner)**: Wall push-ups - Stand facing a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart, place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, and bend your elbows to bring your chest toward the wall
   - **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: Knee push-ups - Position yourself on hands and knees, hands slightly wider than shoulders, lower your chest toward the floor
   - **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Standard push-ups - Support your weight on hands and toes, body straight from head to heels

2. Perform 5 repetitions of your chosen push-up style, focusing on using maximum effort for each one
3. Rest for 30 seconds between each push-up
4. Pay attention to which muscles you feel working the hardest

**Self-assessment:**
- Were you able to maintain good form for all 5 repetitions?
- Which muscles did you feel working the most? (likely chest, shoulders, and arms)
- Rate your effort level from 1-5, with 5 being maximum effort
- If you completed Level 1 or 2 easily, consider trying the next level next time

**Troubleshooting tips:**
- If your wrists hurt, try doing the push-ups on your knuckles or with hands on a raised surface
- If you feel pain in your shoulders or back, check that your hands are positioned directly under your shoulders
- If you can't complete all 5 repetitions, take longer rest periods or try an easier variation
