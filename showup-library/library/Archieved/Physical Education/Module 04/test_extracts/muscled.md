## The Major Muscle Groups 
Create an explainer voiceover abou the below: 

Your body contains more than 600 muscles, but we'll focus on six main groups that handle most movements:

1. **Arms**: Your biceps run along the front of your upper arm while your triceps cover the back. Bend your arm and feel your biceps tighten. Now straighten it and notice your triceps activate instead.

2. **Shoulders**: Your deltoids form a cap over the top of each shoulder. These muscles lift your arms forward, sideways, and backward.

3. **Chest**: Your pectoral muscles span across your chest. They activate when you push a door open or do a push-up.

4. **Back**: Your latissimus dorsi spread across your back like wings. These muscles work when you pull a door closed or do a pull-up.

5. **Core**: Your abdominal muscles in front and lower back muscles behind stabilize your body, help you bend, and protect your spine.

6. **Legs**: Your quadriceps cover the front of your thighs, hamstrings run along the back, and calf muscles power your lower legs. These muscles carry you everywhere you go.
