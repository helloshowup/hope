### For Your Arms
your biceps run along the front of your upper arms while your triceps cover the back. You might remember how we identified these muscles - when you bend your arm, you can feel your biceps tighten up. Now let's explore some exercises that will help strengthen both these important arm muscles through simple movements you can do anywhere.

**Wall Push-ups**: 
  - Stand arm's length from a wall with feet shoulder-width apart
  - Place hands flat against the wall at shoulder height and shoulder-width apart
  - Bend your elbows to bring your chest toward the wall, then push back
  - Complete 8-10 repetitions
  - **Success check**: Your body should stay straight from head to heels throughout the movement
  - **Too easy?** Move your feet farther from the wall to increase difficulty
