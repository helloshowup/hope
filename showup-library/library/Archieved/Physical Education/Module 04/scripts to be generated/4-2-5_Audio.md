Content to be covered:
Push-ups are one of the most well-known bodyweight exercises and for good reason - they effectively work your chest, shoulders, and arms all at once.

 **Push-ups**: 
  - Start in plank position with hands slightly wider than shoulders
  - Keep body straight from head to heels
  - Lower your chest toward the floor by bending elbows
  - Push back up to starting position
  - Complete 5-10 repetitions
  - **Success check**: Your body should move as one unit without sagging in the middle
