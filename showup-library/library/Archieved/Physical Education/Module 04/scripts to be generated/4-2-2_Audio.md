Content to be covered:
Chair dips are a great exercise for strengthening your triceps - those muscles on the back of your upper arms that help you push things away from your body.

**Chair Dips**: 
  - Find a sturdy chair that doesn't slide (place against wall if needed)
  - Sit on the chair's edge with hands gripping the edge beside your hips
  - Walk feet forward and slide hips off the chair
  - Lower your body by bending elbows to about 90 degrees, then push up
  - Complete 5-8 repetitions
  - **Success check**: Keep shoulders down away from ears; elbows should point behind you
  - **Troubleshooting**: If your chair slides, place it against a wall or use a heavier piece of furniture
