Content to be covered:
The bird-dog exercise gets its name because you'll look a bit like a hunting dog pointing at a bird - it's great for building core stability and balance.

**Bird-dog**: 
  - Begin on hands and knees, hands under shoulders and knees under hips
  - Extend right arm forward while extending left leg backward
  - Keep your back flat and hips level (don't tilt sideways)
  - Hold for 2 seconds, return to start position
  - Repeat with left arm and right leg
  - Complete 5 repetitions on each side
  - **Success check**: Your back stays flat without arching or sagging
  - **Troubleshooting**: If balancing is difficult, start by lifting just the arm, then just the leg, before combining
