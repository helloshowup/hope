Content to be covered:
The plank is one of the most effective core exercises because it works multiple muscles at once while teaching your body to maintain proper alignment.

**Plank**: 
  - Position yourself on forearms and toes, elbows under shoulders
  - Keep body in straight line from head to heels
  - Hold this position, starting with 10 seconds
  - **Progress tracker**: Record your time and try to add 5 seconds each day
  - **Success check**: Your back shouldn't sag or arch upward
  - **Modification**: Do the plank on your knees instead of toes if needed
