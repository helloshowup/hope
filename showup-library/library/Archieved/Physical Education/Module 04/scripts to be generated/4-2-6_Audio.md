Content to be covered:
Modified push-ups are a perfect starting point if regular push-ups feel too challenging, allowing you to build chest strength gradually.

**Modified Push-ups**: 
  - Same form but with knees on the floor
  - Keep your back straight from head to knees
  - Complete 8-12 repetitions
  - **Progress tracker**: Once you can do 15 knee push-ups with good form, try a standard push-up
