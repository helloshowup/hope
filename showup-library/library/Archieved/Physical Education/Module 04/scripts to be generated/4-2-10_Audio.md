Curl-ups are a safer alternative to traditional sit-ups that focus on strengthening your abdominal muscles without straining your neck or back.

**Curl-ups**: 
  - Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on floor
  - Place hands on thighs
  - Curl your upper body until fingertips reach your knees
  - Lower back down with control
  - Complete 10-15 repetitions
  - **Success check**: Your movement should be smooth without jerking or using momentum
