Content to be covered:
**What you'll need:**
- A clear space about 6 feet long and 3 feet wide
- A timer or clock with a second hand
- A wall for modified push-ups (if needed)
- A towel or exercise mat (optional)

**Setup instructions:**
1. Clear the space of any objects that might get in your way
2. Place your mat or towel on the floor if you're using one
3. Set your timer nearby where you can easily see it

**Activity steps:**
1. Choose the push-up version that matches your current ability:
   - **Level 1 (Beginner)**: Wall push-ups - Stand facing a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart, place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, and bend your elbows to bring your chest toward the wall
   - **Level 2 (Intermediate)**: Knee push-ups - Position yourself on hands and knees, hands slightly wider than shoulders, lower your chest toward the floor
   - **Level 3 (Advanced)**: Standard push-ups - Support your weight on hands and toes, body straight from head to heels

2. Perform 5 repetitions of your chosen push-up style, focusing on using maximum effort for each one
3. Rest for 30 seconds between each push-up
4. Pay attention to which muscles you feel working the hardest

**Self-assessment:**
- Were you able to maintain good form for all 5 repetitions?
- Which muscles did you feel working the most? (likely chest, shoulders, and arms)
- Rate your effort level from 1-5, with 5 being maximum effort
- If you completed Level 1 or 2 easily, consider trying the next level next time

**Troubleshooting tips:**
- If your wrists hurt, try doing the push-ups on your knuckles or with hands on a raised surface
- If you feel pain in your shoulders or back, check that your hands are positioned directly under your shoulders
- If you can't complete all 5 repetitions, take longer rest periods or try an easier variation
