        <h1 style="color: #920205;">4.2 Bodyweight Training: Using Your Body to Get Stronger!</h1>
<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Explain why bodyweight exercises are a good way to get stronger</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Show how to do at least 3 different bodyweight exercises correctly</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Create a short workout using your favorite bodyweight exercises</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exercise mat or folded blanket (optional)</li>
<li>Water bottle</li>
<li>Clock, watch, or phone timer</li>
<li>Sturdy chair (for chair dips)</li>
<li>Small pieces of paper (for Exercise Cards activity)</li>
<li>Notebook or paper (for tracking progress)</li>
<li>Pen or pencil</li>
</ul>
<p>Your body works as natural exercise equipment! Bodyweight training relies on your own weight to challenge your muscles. During push-ups, your arms lift a portion of your body weight. When performing squats, your leg muscles control lowering and raising your body.</p>
<p><br/><br />
The real advantage? These exercises require no equipment and fit almost anywhere in your day. You can do them while watching television, before bedtime, or in any small space at home to strengthen your muscles.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your Home Exercise Space</h2>
<p>Before starting, create a safe exercise area:<br />
1\ <strong>Clear a space</strong>: Remove any furniture, toys, or objects that might get in your way or cause trips<br />
2\ <strong>Surface check</strong>: Find a carpeted area or use an exercise mat (a folded blanket works too!)<br />
3\ <strong>Water station</strong>: Keep a water bottle nearby to stay hydrated<br />
4\ <strong>Clothing</strong>: Wear comfortable clothes that let you move freely<br />
5\ <strong>Timer</strong>: Have a clock, watch, or phone timer ready to track exercise time</p>
<p><br/><br />
If you don't have much space, that's okay! Most of these exercises need only enough room to lie down with arms extended.</p>
<h2>Awesome Bodyweight Exercises You Can Try</h2>
<p>Remember in Lesson 3.3 when we learned about the major muscle groups in our bodies? Now we're going to put that knowledge into action! In this lesson, we'll build on what you already know about muscles by showing you specific exercises that target each area.</p>
<p>You won't need any fancy equipment for these exercises - just your own body and a little bit of space. We'll start with simple versions that anyone can do, then show you how to make them harder as you get stronger. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a collection of exercises you can mix and match to create your own workout routine that fits your schedule and the space you have available.</p>

<h3>For Your Arms</h3>
<p>In our last lesson, we learned that your biceps run along the front of your upper arms while your triceps cover the back. You might remember how we identified these muscles - when you bend your arm, you can feel your biceps tighten up. Now let's explore some exercises that will help strengthen both these important arm muscles through simple movements you can do anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Wall Push-ups</strong>: <br />
  - Stand arm's length from a wall with feet shoulder-width apart<br />
  - Place hands flat against the wall at shoulder height and shoulder-width apart<br />
  - Bend your elbows to bring your chest toward the wall, then push back<br />
  - Complete 8-10 repetitions<br />
  - <strong>Success check</strong>: Your body should stay straight from head to heels throughout the movement<br />
  - <strong>Too easy?</strong> Move your feet farther from the wall to increase difficulty</p>

</h3>
<p>Chair dips are a great exercise for strengthening your triceps - those muscles on the back of your upper arms that help you push things away from your body.</p>
<p><strong>Chair Dips</strong>: <br />
  - Find a sturdy chair that doesn't slide (place against wall if needed)<br />
  - Sit on the chair's edge with hands gripping the edge beside your hips<br />
  - Walk feet forward and slide hips off the chair<br />
  - Lower your body by bending elbows to about 90 degrees, then push up<br />
  - Complete 5-8 repetitions<br />
  - <strong>Success check</strong>: Keep shoulders down away from ears; elbows should point behind you<br />
  - <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: If your chair slides, place it against a wall or use a heavier piece of furniture</p>
<h3>For Your Shoulders</h3>
<p>In our previous lesson, we identified the deltoid muscles that form a cap over the top of each shoulder. These important muscles help you lift your arms forward, sideways, and backward. The following exercises will specifically target these shoulder muscles to help you build strength in this area that's used for so many everyday movements, from reaching for objects on high shelves to carrying your backpack.</p>

<p>Shoulder taps are a great exercise that not only works your shoulders but also challenges your core stability as you balance in the position.</p>
<p><strong>Shoulder Taps</strong>: <br />
  - Begin in a modified push-up position (on knees for beginners, full position for advanced)<br />
  - Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees/feet<br />
  - Lift one hand to tap the opposite shoulder while keeping hips steady<br />
  - Return hand to floor and repeat with other hand<br />
  - Complete 5 taps per side for beginners, 10-15 for advanced<br />
  - <strong>Success check</strong>: Your hips shouldn't twist or rock side-to-side during taps<br />
  - <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: If your hips rotate, widen your hand position or try the knee version</p>
<h3>For Your Chest</h3>
<p>Remember from our previous lesson that your pectoral muscles span across your chest? These are the muscles that activate when you push a door open. Now we'll learn some exercises that specifically target these chest muscles, helping you build strength for pushing movements that you use in everyday activities, from moving furniture to pushing a shopping cart.</p>

<p><strong>Modified Push-ups</strong>: <br />
  - Same form but with knees on the floor<br />
  - Keep your back straight from head to knees<br />
  - Complete 8-12 repetitions<br />
  - <strong>Progress tracker</strong>: Once you can do 15 knee push-ups with good form, try a standard push-up</p>
<h3>For Your Back</h3>
<p>The latissimus dorsi muscles that spread across your back like wings. These powerful muscles work when you pull a door closed or do activities that involve pulling motions. The following exercises will help strengthen these important back muscles that support good posture and help protect your spine during daily activities.</p>

<h3>For Your Core (Abs and Lower Back)</h3>
<p>Your core includes both the abdominal muscles in front and the lower back muscles behind. These muscles work together to stabilize your body, help you bend in different directions, and protect your spine. A strong core is essential for good posture and helps prevent back pain, which is why the following exercises are so important for overall fitness.</p>

<h2>Doing It Right (and Making It Work for You)</h2>
<h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3>
<p>If an exercise feels too challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the number of repetitions (try 5 instead of 10)</li>
<li>Take longer rest breaks between exercises (30-60 seconds)</li>
<li>Use modified versions (knee push-ups instead of standard ones)</li>
<li>Decrease how long you hold positions (5 seconds instead of 10)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an exercise seems too simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase repetitions (try 15 instead of 10)</li>
<li>Extend how long you hold positions (20 seconds instead of 10)</li>
<li>Reduce rest time between exercises (15-30 seconds)</li>
<li>Progress to more difficult versions (standard push-ups instead of wall push-ups)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Troubleshooting Common Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of balance</strong>: Widen your stance or hold onto a stable object for support</li>
<li><strong>Wrist discomfort during push-ups</strong>: Try performing them on fists or with hands on books/blocks</li>
<li><strong>Back pain during core exercises</strong>: Focus on keeping your core tight and back flat</li>
<li><strong>Knee discomfort during squats/lunges</strong>: Reduce depth or try chair squats instead</li>
