# 4.3 Flexibility Training

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Name the main types of stretching
- Show how to do key stretches safely

## Materials Needed
- Exercise mat (or alternatives: folded blanket, beach towel, non-slip rug, or carpeted area)
- Sturdy chair or wall for balance support
- Comfortable clothing that allows free movement
- Water bottle
- Open space (at least 6 feet by 6 feet)

Flexibility helps your body move better, prevents injuries, and can make you feel more relaxed. It's just as necessary as building strong muscles and having good endurance. Let's learn different stretching methods, safety tips, and try some useful stretches that will benefit your body.

## Types of Stretching
You can stretch your muscles in several ways:

**Static Stretching:** Slowly stretch a muscle and hold the position for 15-30 seconds. When you reach for your toes and stay there, that's static stretching. This works well for increasing your overall flexibility.

**Dynamic Stretching:** These are moving stretches without holding positions. Arm circles and leg swings are good examples. Use these before playing sports or being active.

**Ballistic Stretching:** This uses bouncing or jerking movements during a stretch. This isn't safe for middle school students because it can damage your muscles.

## Guidelines for Safe and Effective Stretching
Stay safe while stretching by following these rules:

1. **Always warm up first!** Walk or jog in place for 5 minutes before you start stretching.
2. **Stretching shouldn't hurt.** You should feel a gentle pull, but never pain.
3. **Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds** and breathe normally.
4. **Keep movements smooth** - bouncing can hurt you.
5. **Keep breathing** during your stretches.
6. **Work both sides** of your body equally.
7. **Stop immediately** if something hurts.

## Setting Up Your Stretching Space
Before you begin stretching at home:

1. **Clear a space** at least 6 feet by 6 feet where you can move freely.
2. **Find a non-slip surface** - a carpet, exercise mat, or even a folded blanket works well.
3. **Have a sturdy chair or wall nearby** for balance during standing stretches.
4. **Wear comfortable clothes** that allow you to move freely.
5. **Remove distractions** - turn off the TV and put your phone away.
6. **Have water nearby** to stay hydrated.

If you don't have an exercise mat, alternatives include:
- A folded blanket or beach towel
- A non-slip rug
- A carpeted area of your home

## Key Flexibility Exercises
Now that we understand the basics, let's explore some helpful stretches to improve your flexibility:

### Audio Instructions: Shoulder Rolls

---audioinstructionsEND---

Let's start with a simple stretch that anyone can do, no matter how flexible you are. Shoulder rolls are perfect for releasing tension after sitting at a desk or using a computer. If you have tight shoulders from carrying a heavy backpack, this stretch will feel especially good!

1. **Shoulder Rolls:**
   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Roll your shoulders forward 5 times in complete circles
   - Roll your shoulders backward 5 times
   - Success check: Your shoulders should feel looser, with no pain during the movement

### Audio Instructions: Neck Stretches

---audioinstructionsEND---

Now let's move to your neck, which often gets stiff from looking down at phones or tablets. This stretch can be done sitting or standing, making it perfect for when you need a quick break during homework time. If you ever feel dizzy during this stretch, stop and return to the center position.

2. **Neck Stretch:**
   - Stand or sit with a straight back
   - Slowly tilt your head toward your right shoulder until you feel a gentle stretch
   - Hold for 15 seconds while breathing normally
   - Return to center, then tilt toward your left shoulder
   - Success check: You should feel a gentle pull along the side of your neck without pain

### Audio Instructions: Hamstring Stretch

---audioinstructionsEND---

Next up is the hamstring stretch, which helps the muscles in the back of your legs. Many kids have tight hamstrings from sitting a lot or from growth spurts. Don't worry if you can't reach your toes - just reach as far as is comfortable for you. The stretch happens in your leg, not in how far your hands go!

3. **Hamstring Stretch:**
   - Sit on your mat with your right leg extended straight, toes pointing up
   - Bend your left leg so your left foot touches your right inner thigh
   - Keeping your back straight (not rounded), reach toward your right toes
   - Hold where you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh for 15-30 seconds
   - Switch legs and repeat
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in the back of your thigh, not your lower back

### Audio Instructions: Quadriceps Stretch
https://api.learnstage.com/media-manager/api/access/exceled/default/lms/courses/1648/podcasts/4-3-4.mp3
---audioinstructionsEND---

The quadriceps stretch works the front of your thighs - these are the big muscles you use when climbing stairs or riding a bike. If balancing is hard for you, it's totally fine to hold onto something sturdy like a chair, wall, or even a doorframe. Remember, good balance takes practice, so don't get frustrated if you wobble at first!

4. **Quadriceps Stretch:**
   - Stand next to a wall or chair for support
   - Balance on your left leg, using the support if needed
   - Bend your right knee and grab your right ankle with your right hand
   - Gently pull your heel toward your buttocks
   - Keep your knees close together and stand tall
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in the front of your thigh

### Audio Instructions:Calf Stretch

---audioinstructionsEND---\

This calf stretch is super important if you play sports or do activities that involve running and jumping. If you don't have a wall available, you can also do this stretch on a step (like at the bottom of a staircase) by letting your heel hang off the edge. Just make sure you have something to hold onto for safety!

5. **Calf Stretch:**
   - Face a wall and place your hands on it at shoulder height
   - Step back with your right foot, keeping it flat on the floor
   - Bend your left knee slightly while keeping your right leg straight
   - Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your right calf
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in your calf muscle, not your Achilles tendon (the cord just above your heel)

### Audio Instructions: Side Stretch

---audioinstructionsEND---

Our final stretch targets the sides of your body, which often get overlooked but are important for twisting movements in sports and everyday activities. This stretch feels especially good after sitting for a long time. If you have limited space, you can do this stretch sitting on the edge of your bed or a chair.

6. **Side Stretch:**
   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Raise your right arm overhead
   - Lean your upper body to the left until you feel a stretch along your right side
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch sides
   - Success check: You should feel a smooth stretch along your side without twisting forward or backward

## Common Stretching Challenges and Solutions

Everyone faces challenges when stretching, especially when you're just starting out. Don't worry if something feels difficult at first - your body needs time to become more flexible. Here are some common problems you might run into and how to fix them:

**Challenge:** Losing balance during standing stretches
**Solution:** Position yourself closer to a wall or sturdy furniture for support, or try the stretch in a seated position

**Challenge:** Not feeling the stretch in the right place
**Solution:** Make small adjustments to your position and focus on the specific muscle you're targeting

**Challenge:** Experiencing pain instead of a gentle pull
**Solution:** Immediately reduce the intensity of your stretch; only stretch to the point of mild tension

**Challenge:** Limited flexibility making stretches difficult
**Solution:** Use modified versions (examples provided in the activity section below)
