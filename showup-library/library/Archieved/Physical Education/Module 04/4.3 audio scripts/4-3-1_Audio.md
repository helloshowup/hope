Let's start with a simple stretch that anyone can do, no matter how flexible you are. Shoulder rolls are perfect for releasing tension after sitting at a desk or using a computer. If you have tight shoulders from carrying a heavy backpack, this stretch will feel especially good!

   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Roll your shoulders forward 5 times in complete circles
   - Roll your shoulders backward 5 times
   - Success check: Your shoulders should feel looser, with no pain during the movement
