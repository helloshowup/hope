Content to be covered:
Our final stretch targets the sides of your body, which often get overlooked but are important for twisting movements in sports and everyday activities. This stretch feels especially good after sitting for a long time. If you have limited space, you can do this stretch sitting on the edge of your bed or a chair.

6. **Side Stretch:**
   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
   - Raise your right arm overhead
   - Lean your upper body to the left until you feel a stretch along your right side
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch sides
   - Success check: You should feel a smooth stretch along your side without twisting forward or backward
