Content to be covered:
Next up is the hamstring stretch, which helps the muscles in the back of your legs. Many kids have tight hamstrings from sitting a lot or from growth spurts. Don't worry if you can't reach your toes - just reach as far as is comfortable for you. The stretch happens in your leg, not in how far your hands go!

3. **Hamstring Stretch:**
   - Sit on your mat with your right leg extended straight, toes pointing up
   - Bend your left leg so your left foot touches your right inner thigh
   - Keeping your back straight (not rounded), reach toward your right toes
   - Hold where you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh for 15-30 seconds
   - Switch legs and repeat
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in the back of your thigh, not your lower back
