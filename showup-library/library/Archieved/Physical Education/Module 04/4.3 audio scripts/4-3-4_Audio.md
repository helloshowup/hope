Content to be covered:
The quadriceps stretch works the front of your thighs - these are the big muscles you use when climbing stairs or riding a bike. If balancing is hard for you, it's totally fine to hold onto something sturdy like a chair, wall, or even a doorframe. Remember, good balance takes practice, so don't get frustrated if you wobble at first!

   - Stand next to a wall or chair for support
   - Balance on your left leg, using the support if needed

   - Gently pull your heel toward your buttocks
   - Keep your knees close together and stand tall
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs
