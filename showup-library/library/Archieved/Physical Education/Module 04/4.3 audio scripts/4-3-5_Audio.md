Script title: Calf Stretch
File name: 4-3-5.mp3
Content to be covered:
This calf stretch is super important if you play sports or do activities that involve running and jumping. If you don't have a wall available, you can also do this stretch on a step (like at the bottom of a staircase) by letting your heel hang off the edge. Just make sure you have something to hold onto for safety!

5. **Calf Stretch:**
   - Face a wall and place your hands on it at shoulder height
   - Step back with your right foot, keeping it flat on the floor
   - Bend your left knee slightly while keeping your right leg straight
   - Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your right calf
   - Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs
   - Success check: You should feel the stretch in your calf muscle, not your Achilles tendon (the cord just above your heel)
