# Narrative Models in Film: Vladimir Propp's Character Archetypes and Narrative Functions

Stories form the backbone of human communication across cultures and time. As creative practitioners, understanding narrative structures gives you a significant advantage in crafting compelling work that resonates with audiences. Russian folklorist Vladimir Propp noticed fascinating patterns in storytelling—recurring character types and plot elements that appear across vastly different tales. Let's explore how these patterns show up in films you know and how you can harness them in your own creative projects.

## Propp's Character Archetypes
Propp identified recurring character types that appear across different stories. These archetypes aren't rigid categories but flexible roles that help structure narratives:

1. **The Hero**: The protagonist who drives the story forward. They often undergo transformation and growth.
   * *Examples*: Shuri in *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever*, Miles Morales in *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*

2. **The Villain**: The antagonist who creates obstacles and challenges for the hero.
   * *Examples*: Erik Killmonger in *Black Panther*, Thanos in *Avengers: Infinity War*

3. **The Dispatcher**: The character who sends the hero on their journey or quest.
   * *Examples*: Nick Fury in the Marvel films, Morpheus in *The Matrix*

4. **The Helper**: Characters who assist the hero throughout their journey.
   * *Examples*: Samwise Gamgee in *The Lord of the Rings*, Hermione and Ron in *Harry Potter*

5. **The Princess/Prize**: The object of the hero's quest (not necessarily a person).
   * *Examples*: The vibranium in *Black Panther*, the One Ring in *The Lord of the Rings*

6. **The Donor**: A character who provides the hero with something magical or valuable.
   * *Examples*: Q in James Bond films, Ollivander giving Harry his wand in *Harry Potter*

7. **The Father**: Often represents authority or establishes rules within the story world.
   * *Examples*: King T'Chaka in *Black Panther*, Uncle Ben in *Spider-Man*

8. **The False Hero**: Appears to be helpful but may have ulterior motives.
   * *Examples*: Cypher in *The Matrix*, Hans in *Frozen*

## Propp's Narrative Functions
Beyond character types, Propp identified common plot elements or "functions" that appear in many stories. Here are ten key functions with film examples:

1. **Absence**: The hero leaves their familiar environment.
   * *Example*: T'Challa leaving Wakanda to pursue Klaue in *Black Panther*

2. **Interdiction**: The hero receives a warning or prohibition.
   * *Example*: Peter Parker being told "with great power comes great responsibility"

3. **Violation**: The hero breaks the warning or rule.
   * *Example*: Ariel in *The Little Mermaid* visiting the surface despite her father's warnings

4. **Reconnaissance**: The villain gathers information about the hero.
   * *Example*: Killmonger researching Wakanda's defences in *Black Panther*

5. **Delivery**: The villain gains information about the hero.
   * *Example*: Thanos learning the locations of the Infinity Stones in *Avengers: Infinity War*

6. **Trickery**: The villain attempts to deceive the hero.
   * *Example*: Loki's many deceptions throughout the Thor and Avengers films

7. **Complicity**: The hero unwittingly helps the villain.
   * *Example*: Dr. Strange giving Thanos the Time Stone in *Avengers: Infinity War*

8. **Villainy**: The villain causes harm or creates a lack.
   * *Example*: Thanos' snap eliminating half of all life in *Avengers: Infinity War*

9. **Mediation**: The hero discovers the villainy and decides to act.
   * *Example*: Neo accepting his role as "The One" in *The Matrix*

10. **Beginning of Counteraction**: The hero takes direct action against the villain.
    * *Example*: The Avengers assembling to defeat Thanos in *Endgame*

## Application to Your Creative Work
How can you use these patterns in your own work? Here are some practical applications:

1. **Analysis**: When watching films or reading stories, spot these elements to deepen your understanding of narrative mechanics.

2. **Creation**: Use these structures as flexible frameworks for your projects—whether you're working in film, animation, game design, or other media.

3. **Subversion**: Once you understand these patterns, you can intentionally break or twist them for surprising and original effects.

4. **Cultural Context**: How do these archetypes appear in South African storytelling? Consider how traditional narratives might use similar or different structures.

## Over to You
Think about a South African film or a film you've recently watched. Can you identify:
- Three character archetypes from Propp's model?
- Three narrative functions from the list above?
- How might the film have been different if these elements were changed?

## Conclusion
Propp's character archetypes and narrative functions offer valuable tools for understanding and creating stories. You can use these insights to analyse existing works and to craft your own compelling narratives. Remember that these are flexible frameworks rather than rigid rules—they're meant to spark your creativity, not constrain it.

In your upcoming assignments, try applying Propp's models to your own creative projects. You might be surprised at how understanding these fundamental narrative structures can transform your storytelling abilities.
