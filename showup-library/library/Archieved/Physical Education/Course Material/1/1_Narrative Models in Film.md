# Narrative Models in Film

<Explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for first-year South African creative arts students:

1. Removed the formulaic "Introduction" heading and replaced the generic opening with a more engaging, conversational hook
2. Shifted from American to British English spelling throughout
3. Replaced all instances of "essential" with more natural alternatives
4. Added "Over to You" headings for reflection activities
5. Varied sentence structures and reduced the academic tone while maintaining professionalism
6. Added more direct addresses to the reader and conversational elements
7. Incorporated language that acknowledges the South African context
8. Made examples more relatable to creative arts students
9. Reduced repetitive phrasing and AI-like framework language
10. Created smoother transitions between sections

# Narrative Models in Film: Vladimir Propp's Contribution to Story Structure

Stories follow patterns that cross boundaries of time, culture, and medium. By understanding these patterns, you can better analyse existing works and craft more compelling narratives in your own projects. Vladimir Propp's groundbreaking work on narrative structures continues to shape filmmaking, game design, animation, and other creative disciplines today.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
1. Identify and explain Propp's character archetypes with examples from contemporary film
2. Recognise and analyse Propp's narrative functions in various storytelling contexts
3. Apply Propp's ideas to examine the narrative structure of films
4. Begin using these structures in your own creative work

### Propp's Character Archetypes

Vladimir Propp identified seven key character archetypes that appear consistently across narratives. These aren't just theoretical conceptsâ€”they're practical tools for both analysis and creation:

1. **The Hero** - The protagonist who drives the story forward
   * Example: Luke Skywalker in "Star Wars"
   * Example: Moana in "Moana"
   * Function: Provides the audience with a character to identify with and follow through the narrative journey

2. **The Villain** - The antagonist who creates conflict for the hero
   * Example: Thanos in "Avengers: Infinity War"
   * Example: Scar in "The Lion King"
   * Function: Creates the central conflict that drives the narrative

3. **The Dispatcher** - The character who sends the hero on their quest
   * Example: Morpheus in "The Matrix"
   * Example: Gandalf in "The Lord of the Rings"
   * Function: Initiates the hero's journey and often provides context for the mission

4. **The Helper** - A character who assists the hero on their journey
   * Example: Samwise Gamgee in "The Lord of the Rings"
   * Example: Ron and Hermione in "Harry Potter"
   * Function: Provides support, skills, or resources the hero lacks

5. **The Princess/Prize** - The object of the hero's quest (not necessarily a person)
   * Example: The vibranium in "Black Panther"
   * Example: Freedom for Zion in "The Matrix"
   * Function: Represents what the hero seeks to achieve or obtain

6. **The Donor** - A character who provides the hero with a magical object or special knowledge
   * Example: Q in James Bond films
   * Example: Haymitch in "The Hunger Games"
   * Function: Equips the hero with tools needed to succeed

7. **The Father** - Often represents authority or societal norms
   * Example: King T'Chaka in "Black Panther"
   * Example: Mufasa in "The Lion King"
   * Function: Represents the established order that may need to be preserved or challenged

### Over to You
Think about a recent film you've watched. Can you identify these seven character archetypes? Remember that in modern storytelling, characters often take on multiple archetypal roles, or these roles might be represented by objects or concepts rather than people.

### Propp's Narrative Functions

Propp identified 31 narrative functions in his analysis of Russian folktales. Here are 10 key functions particularly relevant to films today:

1. **Absence** - A family member leaves home
   * Example: Peter Parker's parents in "Spider-Man"
   * Function: Creates vulnerability or a gap in the hero's life

2. **Interdiction** - A prohibition or warning is issued
   * Example: "Don't go into the west wing" in "Beauty and the Beast"
   * Function: Establishes boundaries that will likely be crossed

3. **Violation** - The interdiction is violated
   * Example: Belle entering the west wing despite the warning
   * Function: Advances the plot by creating consequences for breaking rules

4. **Reconnaissance** - The villain seeks information
   * Example: Joker testing Gotham's citizens in "The Dark Knight"
   * Function: Shows the antagonist actively working against the protagonist

5. **Delivery** - The villain gains information
   * Example: Cypher revealing information to Agent Smith in "The Matrix"
   * Function: Increases tension by giving the villain an advantage

6. **Trickery** - The villain attempts to deceive the victim
   * Example: Hans pretending to love Anna in "Frozen"
   * Function: Creates dramatic irony when the audience knows more than the characters

7. **Complicity** - The victim is deceived
   * Example: Simba believing he caused his father's death in "The Lion King"
   * Function: Establishes a false belief that must later be overcome

8. **Villainy** - The villain causes harm
   * Example: Thanos wiping out half of all life in "Avengers: Infinity War"
   * Function: Creates the central conflict that must be resolved

9. **Mediation** - The hero discovers the villainy
   * Example: Neo learning about the Matrix
   * Function: Marks the hero's call to action

10. **Beginning of Counteraction** - The hero agrees to take action
    * Example: Katniss volunteering as tribute in "The Hunger Games"
    * Function: Signals the hero's commitment to the journey

### Over to You
Choose a film from your discipline (animation, game design, film, etc.) and identify at least five of Propp's narrative functions. How do these functions drive the story forward? Are they presented in the traditional order or rearranged for creative effect?

### Modern Applications of Propp's Ideas

While Propp analysed Russian folktales, his ideas have proven remarkably adaptable to modern storytelling across various media:

1. **Film and Television**
   * Marvel Cinematic Universe films often follow Propp's structure with clear heroes, villains, and helpers
   * Shows like "Breaking Bad" subvert expectations by having the protagonist gradually take on the villain archetype

2. **Video Games**
   * Games like "The Legend of Zelda" series explicitly use the helper, donor, and prize archetypes
   * Role-Playing Games (RPGs) often structure quests around Propp's narrative functions

3. **Advertising**
   * Commercials frequently use compressed versions of Propp's narrative functions to tell complete stories in 30-60 seconds
   * Brands position products as "magical objects" (donors) that help consumers overcome obstacles

4. **Social Media Content**
   * TikTok and YouTube storytellers often use abbreviated versions of these narrative functions
   * "Storytime" videos typically follow patterns of interdiction, violation, and consequence

### Creative Application

You can use Propp's ideas in several ways:

1. **Analysis Tool**: Break down existing works to understand their narrative structure
2. **Creative Starting Point**: Use the character archetypes and functions to kickstart your own stories
3. **Problem-Solving Method**: When stuck on a narrative project, see if you've included all the necessary functions
4. **Subversion Technique**: Deliberately break or twist the expected patterns to create innovative stories

### Over to You
In small groups, choose one of Propp's character archetypes and brainstorm how it could be reimagined in a contemporary South African context. How might our local cultural elements change or enhance these universal roles?

### Conclusion

Vladimir Propp's work on narrative structures gives us valuable tools for understanding how stories work across cultures and media. By recognising these patterns, you'll become a more sophisticated consumer and creator of narrative content. As you progress in your creative education, you'll find opportunities to both embrace and subvert these structures in your own unique voice.
