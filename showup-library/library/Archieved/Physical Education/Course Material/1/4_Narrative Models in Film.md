# Narrative Models in Film

<Analysis>
I've identified several AI patterns in this text that need addressing:

1. Formal, academic tone that may not engage first-year creative students
2. Overuse of terms like "framework," "powerful," "essential," and "analyze"
3. Generic introduction starting with a definition
4. Overly structured content that lacks personality
5. American spelling instead of British spelling
6. Missing "Over to You" heading for reflection section
7. Content that feels disconnected from South African context despite examples

My edits focus on:
- Creating a more engaging, conversational tone while maintaining professionalism
- Replacing "essential" with more natural alternatives
- Converting to British spelling
- Adding the "Over to You" heading
- Making the content more relatable to first-year creative students
- Streamlining explanations while preserving key information
- Adding more direct connections to creative disciplines
- Enhancing South African relevance

# Lesson: The Monomyth in Film and Literature

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain Joseph Campbell's monomyth framework and its three main stages
- Identify the key elements of the hero's journey in diverse film and literary examples
- Apply the monomyth structure to analyse narrative works from various creative disciplines
- Connect the principles of the hero's journey to your own creative practice

The monomyth, or hero's journey, is a story pattern that appears across cultures and throughout history. When Joseph Campbell published "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" in 1949, he revealed how this universal structure shapes stories from ancient myths to modern blockbusters. As creative practitioners, understanding this pattern will transform how you read, watch, and create stories in your own field.

## Key Concepts

### The Three Acts of the Monomyth
The hero's journey unfolds across three fundamental stages:

1. **Departure (or Separation)** 
   - The hero leaves the familiar world behind
   - Includes the call to adventure, refusal, supernatural aid, and crossing the threshold
   - *Example:* Luke Skywalker leaving Tatooine in "Star Wars" or Frodo departing the Shire in "The Lord of the Rings"

2. **Initiation**
   - The hero faces trials, encounters allies and enemies, and undergoes transformation
   - Includes the road of trials, meeting with the goddess, temptation, atonement, and ultimate boon
   - *Example:* Neo's training and confrontations in "The Matrix" or Moana's ocean journey in "Moana"

3. **Return**
   - The hero brings their newfound wisdom or treasure back to benefit their community
   - Includes the refusal of return, magical flight, rescue, crossing the return threshold, and freedom to live
   - *Example:* T'Challa returning to lead Wakanda in "Black Panther" or Katniss's return to District 12 in "The Hunger Games"

### The 12 Stages
While not every story includes all stages, these represent the complete hero's journey:

1. The Ordinary World
2. The Call to Adventure
3. Refusal of the Call
4. Meeting with the Mentor
5. Crossing the First Threshold
6. Tests, Allies, and Enemies
7. Approach to the Inmost Cave
8. The Ordeal
9. Reward (Seizing the Sword)
10. The Road Back
11. Resurrection
12. Return with the Elixir

### Contemporary Adaptations
Modern storytellers often adapt the monomyth to suit different genres, cultures, and mediums:
- Christopher Vogler's streamlined 12-stage model for screenwriting
- Variations that subvert or challenge traditional hero's journey expectations
- Applications beyond traditional narratives (advertising, games, VR experiences)

## Application to Creative Disciplines

### Film & Animation
- Storyboarding techniques to map the hero's journey
- Visual symbolism that reinforces journey stages
- Character design that reflects transformation

### Graphic Design & Illustration
- Visual storytelling through sequential art
- Creating narrative-driven brand identities
- Designing hero archetypes for various applications

### Game Design & Interactive Media
- Player-driven hero's journeys
- Level design that mirrors monomyth stages
- Narrative branching while maintaining journey structure

### Creative Writing & Storytelling
- Adapting the monomyth for different genres
- Creating compelling character arcs
- Subverting audience expectations

## Learning Activities

### Activity 1: Monomyth Mapping (25 minutes)
In small groups, analyse a film or narrative work from your discipline using the monomyth framework:
1. Identify the three main stages (Departure, Initiation, Return)
2. Locate specific scenes that represent key moments in the hero's journey
3. Discuss how the structure enhances the overall narrative
4. Present your findings visually (timeline, diagram, or storyboard)

### Activity 2: Cross-Disciplinary Analysis (20 minutes)
Form new groups with members from different creative disciplines:
1. Share how the monomyth appears in your specific field
2. Identify similarities and differences in application
3. Discuss how understanding the hero's journey benefits your creative practice
4. Consider how you might collaborate across disciplines using this shared narrative structure

### Activity 3: Personal Hero's Journey (15 minutes)
Reflect individually on your own creative journey:
1. Where are you in your hero's journey as a creative practitioner?
2. What was your "call to adventure" that led you to your discipline?
3. Who are your mentors and allies?
4. What challenges are you currently facing?
5. What "elixir" or knowledge do you hope to bring back to your community through your creative work?

## Assessment
Your understanding of the monomyth will be assessed through:
1. A brief analysis (500 words) of a work from your discipline using the hero's journey framework
2. A creative response that applies monomyth principles to your own discipline
3. Participation in class discussions and group activities

## Resources

### Key Reading
- Campbell, J. (1949). The Hero with a Thousand Faces
- Vogler, C. (2007). The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers

### Supplementary Materials
- Film clips demonstrating key monomyth stages
- Discipline-specific examples of the hero's journey
- Online resources for further exploration

### South African and African Examples
- "Tsotsi" (2005, dir. Gavin Hood)
- "Black Panther" (2018, dir. Ryan Coogler)
- "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe
- "Jock of the Bushveld" by Sir James Percy FitzPatrick
- "Chanda's Secrets" by Allan Stratton

## Conclusion
The monomyth gives us a valuable lens for understanding narrative structure across cultures and creative disciplines. By recognising these patterns in existing works and applying them to your own creative practice, you'll develop storytelling skills that connect with audiences on a fundamental level. Think about how you can adapt, challenge, or reimagine this universal structure through your unique perspective and South African cultural context.

## Over to You
