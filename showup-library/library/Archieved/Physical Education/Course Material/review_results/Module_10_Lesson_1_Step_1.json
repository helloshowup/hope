By the end, you'll create your own plan for staying active and healthy for many years to come!\n\n## Why Staying Active Your Whole Life Matters\n\n### What Happens When You Stay Active\nBeing active regularly helps your body in many ways:\n* Makes your heart and lungs stronger\n* Builds muscles and strong bones\n* Gives you more energy\n* Improves your mood and helps you focus better\n* Helps you sleep better at night\n* Keeps your weight at a healthy level\n\n![Image: A middle school student jogging outdoors, looking energetic and happy]\n\n### What Happens When You Don't Stay Active\nWhen people don't move enough:\n* Muscles get weaker and smaller\n* Bones can become fragile (easily broken)\n* Energy levels drop\n* It's harder to maintain a healthy weight\n* Sleep quality gets worse\n* Risk of health problems increases\n\n**Stop and Think:** How do you feel when you haven't been active for several days? How do you feel after you've been active?\n\n## Setting Goals That Grow With You\n\nAs you get older, your fitness goals will change. Here are three types of goals you can set:\n\n### 1. Performance Goals\nThese goals focus on what your body can do.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Run a mile without stopping\n* Do 10 push-ups with good form\n* Touch your toes while sitting\n* Jump rope for 2 minutes\n\n![Diagram: Simple illustrations showing proper form for push-ups with labeled body positions]\n\n### 2. Process Goals\nThese goals focus on how often you move.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Be active for 60 minutes every day\n* Try a new physical activity each month\n* Walk the dog three times a week\n* Stretch for 10 minutes before bed\n\n### 3. Health Goals\nThese goals focus on how you feel.\n\n**Examples:**\n* Have more energy during the day\n* Sleep better at night\n* Feel less stressed\n* Improve your posture (how you sit and stand)\n\n**Try This:** Circle one goal from each category that interests you most!\n\n## Your Lifetime Fitness Vision\n\nThink about how you want to stay active as you grow up. Your vision can include:\n\n### Middle School (Now)\nWhat activities do you enjoy now? What new skills do you want to learn?\n\n### High School (A few years from now)\nWhat sports or activities might you want to try? How will you stay active when schoolwork gets busier?\n\n### Adult Life (Many years from now)\nHow will you stay active when you have a job? What activities can you do your whole life?\n\n![Image: Three simple illustrations showing people of different ages being active in different ways]\n\n## Create Your Fitness Timeline\n\nFollow these steps to create your own fitness timeline:\n\n1. Draw a line across a piece of paper.\n2. Mark three points: \"Now,\" \"High School,\" and \"Adult.\"\n3. At each point, write or draw:\n   * One activity you want to do\n   * One performance goal\n   * One process goal\n   * One health goal\n\n**Safety Tip:** Remember that goals should challenge you but not hurt you. Always start small and build up slowly!\n\n## Try It At Home\n\n### Materials You Need:\n* Paper and pencil or markers\n* Small space to move around (even a bedroom works!)\n* No special equipment needed\n\n### Activity: Fitness Vision Board\n1. Find pictures in magazines or draw images that show activities you want to do throughout your life.\n2. Arrange these pictures on paper to create a vision board (a poster with pictures of your goals).\n3. Add words that describe how you want to feel when you're active.\n4. Share your vision board with a family member and explain your fitness goals.\n\n**Space Tip:** If you don't have much room at home, focus on activities that need little space, like yoga, dancing, or bodyweight exercises (exercises using just your body weight).\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nStaying active throughout your life is one of the best things you can do for your body and mind. By setting goals that can change as you grow, you're creating healthy habits that will help you feel good for many years to come.\n\n**Remember:** The best fitness plan is one you enjoy and can stick with!\n\n## Check Your Understanding\n* Name one benefit of staying active throughout your life.\n* What's the difference between a performance goal and a process goal?\n* Why might your fitness goals change as you get older?\n* What's one activity you could enjoy doing your whole life?\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n* Removed self-referential language (\"In this lesson\") and replaced with direct statements\n* Added brief explanations for potentially unfamiliar terms like \"fragile,\" \"posture,\" \"vision board,\" and \"bodyweight exercises\"\n* Adjusted the opening section to be more direct and action-oriented\n* Made minor formatting adjustments to improve readability while maintaining the original structure\n* Kept changes minimal while ensuring the content remains accessible to the 5th-6th grade reading level",
