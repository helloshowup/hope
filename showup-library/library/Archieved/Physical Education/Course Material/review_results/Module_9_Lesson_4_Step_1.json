Just like having different tools for different jobs, you'll learn quick ways to calm down when you're feeling overwhelmed, short breaks to recharge, and longer practices for deep relaxation. By the end, you'll have your own stress-busting plan that works just for you!\n\n## What You'll Learn\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Use quick 1-minute stress-busters when you feel overwhelmed\n- Practice 5-minute relaxation breaks to recharge\n- Try 15-minute calming routines when you have more time\n- Choose the right technique for different situations\n- Create your own special calm-down space at home\n\n## Quick Stress-Busters (1-2 minutes)\nSometimes you need to calm down fast! Here are some super-quick ways to feel better when stress hits:\n\n**Deep Breathing**\n1. Sit up straight or stand tall\n2. Breathe in slowly through your nose while counting to 4\n3. Hold your breath for a count of 2\n4. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of 6\n5. Repeat 3 times\n\n**Stretch It Out**\n1. Reach your arms up high like you're trying to touch the sky\n2. Slowly bend to one side, then the other\n3. Roll your shoulders backward 5 times\n4. Gently turn your head from side to side\n\n**The 5-4-3-2-1 Game**\nLook around and find:\n- 5 things you can see\n- 4 things you can touch\n- 3 things you can hear\n- 2 things you can smell\n- 1 thing you can taste\n\n> **Try This!** Which quick stress-buster makes you feel most relaxed? Try each one and notice how your body feels after.\n\n## Short Relaxation Breaks (5-10 minutes)\nWhen you have a little more time, these activities help your mind and body reset:\n\n**Relaxing Your Muscles**\n1. Find a comfortable spot to sit or lie down\n2. Start at your toes and squeeze them tight for 5 seconds\n3. Release and feel them relax\n4. Move up to your feet, then legs, and continue all the way to your face\n5. Notice how different your body feels when you finish\n\n![Image: A child lying down with relaxed posture, showing proper position for muscle relaxation]\n\n**Mini Movement Break**\n1. March in place for 30 seconds\n2. Do 10 arm circles forward and backward\n3. Stretch your arms out wide, then give yourself a hug\n4. Gently twist your upper body from side to side\n5. End with 5 deep breaths\n\n**Calm Bubble**\n1. Sit in a comfortable position\n2. Close your eyes or look at one spot\n3. Imagine you're inside a giant, protective bubble\n4. Picture your bubble filled with your favorite color\n5. Breathe deeply and feel safe in your bubble for 3-5 minutes\n\n> **Safety Tip:** If any movement causes pain, stop right away. These activities should feel good, not hurt!\n\n## Longer Calming Practices (15-20 minutes)\nWhen you have more time, these longer activities help you feel deeply relaxed:\n\n**Peaceful Place Journey**\n1. Find a quiet spot where you won't be disturbed\n2. Sit or lie down comfortably\n3. Close your eyes and take 5 deep breaths\n4. Imagine a place where you feel completely safe and happy\n5. What do you see there? What sounds do you hear?\n6. Can you feel the temperature? Are there any smells?\n7. Spend 10 minutes exploring this special place in your mind\n8. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes\n\n**Gentle Movement Flow**\n1. Start by standing tall, feet hip-width apart\n2. Raise your arms slowly as you breathe in\n3. Lower them as you breathe out\n4. Gently bend forward, only as far as feels comfortable\n5. Roll back up slowly, one vertebra at a time (that means one back bone at a time)\n6. Repeat this flow 5-10 times, moving with your breath\n7. End by standing still and noticing how your body feels\n\n![Image: A student demonstrating the standing tall position with proper alignment]\n\n> **Adapt It!** If you don't have much space, you can do the Gentle Movement Flow sitting in a chair. Just make the movements smaller!\n\n## When to Use Different Techniques\nDifferent situations call for different tools from your toolkit:\n\n**Use Quick Stress-Busters when:**\n- You feel suddenly nervous before a test\n- You're frustrated with homework\n- You're about to have a difficult conversation\n- You notice your heart beating fast\n\n**Try Short Relaxation Breaks when:**\n- You need a study break\n- You feel tired but still have work to do\n- You want to calm down after playing or exercising\n- You're having trouble focusing\n\n**Use Longer Calming Practices when:**\n- You have time before bed to wind down\n- You feel overwhelmed by big emotions\n- You need deep relaxation after a busy day\n- You want to practice self-care on weekends\n\n## Creating Your Calm-Down Space\nHaving a special place for relaxation can help you feel better faster.
