When you're active in sports, PE class, or just playing with friends, what you eat before and after can make a huge difference in how you feel and perform. Let's discover how to choose foods that give you energy, help your muscles grow stronger, and keep you healthy for all your favorite activities.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nAfter this lesson, you will be able to:\n- Explain what the MyPlate model is and how it helps you eat a balanced diet\n- Choose healthy snacks that give you energy before exercise\n- Pick foods that help your body recover after being active\n- Understand food labels to make better choices\n\n## The MyPlate Model\nThe MyPlate model is a simple picture that shows how to build a healthy meal. Imagine your plate divided into sections:\n- **Fruits**: Colorful and sweet, these give you quick energy and vitamins (apples, bananas, berries)\n- **Vegetables**: These power-packed foods have vitamins and minerals to keep you healthy (carrots, broccoli, spinach)\n- **Grains**: These give you long-lasting energy (bread, pasta, rice - especially whole grain versions)\n- **Protein**: These help build and repair your muscles (chicken, beans, eggs, nuts)\n- **Dairy**: These build strong bones (milk, yogurt, cheese)\n\nTry to include foods from each group in your meals to fuel your body right!\n\n## Pre-Workout Snacks\nEating a small snack about 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body the energy it needs to perform well. Here are some awesome pre-workout snack ideas:\n\n- **Banana with a spoonful of peanut butter**: The banana gives you quick energy while the peanut butter helps that energy last longer\n- **Apple slices with cheese**: The perfect combo of quick energy and protein\n- **Yogurt with berries**: Tasty, easy to digest, and full of nutrients\n- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These give you steady energy that won't run out too quickly\n\nRemember: Your pre-workout snack shouldn't be too big or heavy - just enough to fuel your activity!\n\n## Post-Workout Refueling\nAfter you've been active, your body needs to refuel and repair. Eating within 30-45 minutes after exercise helps your muscles recover and grow stronger. Good post-workout foods include:\n\n- **Chocolate milk**: It might sound too good to be true, but chocolate milk has the perfect mix of carbs and protein to help your body recover!\n- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: Lean protein helps repair muscles, and the wrap gives you energy\n- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Easy to make and packed with nutrients\n- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: A tasty combination that gives you protein and carbs\n\nDrinking water after exercise is super important too! Your body needs to replace the fluids lost through sweat.\n\n## Reading Food Labels\nFood labels can tell you a lot about what you're eating. Here's what to look for:\n\n- **Serving size**: This tells you how much food counts as one serving\n- **Calories**: This is how much energy the food provides\n- **Protein**: Look for foods with good protein content to help your muscles\n- **Carbohydrates**: These give you energy - whole grains and natural sugars are better than added sugars\n- **Sugars**: Try to limit foods with lots of added sugars\n- **Ingredients list**: Shorter lists with words you recognize usually mean less processed foods\n\n**Try This!** Next time you're at the store or in your kitchen, compare the labels on two similar snacks. Which one would be better before or after exercise? Why?\n\n## Conclusion\nWhat you eat before and after being active can make a big difference in how you feel and perform. Using the MyPlate model to choose a variety of foods, picking the right pre- and post-workout snacks, and understanding food labels will help you fuel your body for success. Remember, good nutrition helps you have more energy, build stronger muscles, and feel your best during all your activities!\n\n---\n\n### Changes Made:\n* Removed self-referential phrase \"In this lesson\" from the introduction and replaced it with \"Let's discover\"\n* Changed \"By the end of this lesson, you will\" to \"After this lesson, you will\" in the learning objectives to sound more natural\n* Maintained the conversational, friendly tone that works well for middle school students\n* Kept the clear structure and practical examples that are relatable to the target age group\n* Preserved the \"Try This!\" activity which provides an engaging application opportunity",
