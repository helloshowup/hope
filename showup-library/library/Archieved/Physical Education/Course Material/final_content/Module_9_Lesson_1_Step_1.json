Different types of movement that help reduce stress. The warning signs your body shows when stressed. Fun movement activities you can do at home to feel calmer.\n\n## What is Stress?\nYour body naturally reacts when you feel challenged or threatened - that's stress. Everyone experiences it! You might feel it before a test, during an argument with a friend, or when trying something new.\n\nWhen you're stressed, your body responds in specific ways:\n- Your muscles get tight and tense\n- Your heart beats faster\n- Your breathing gets quicker and shallower\n- You might find it hard to focus or think clearly\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person showing physical signs of stress with labelled arrows pointing to tense shoulders, racing heart, and worried expression]\n\n## How Movement Helps Beat Stress\n\nMoving your body is one of the most effective ways to fight stress! Here's how it helps:\n\n### Feel-Good Brain Chemicals\nWhen you exercise, your brain releases special chemicals called endorphins. These are your body's natural mood boosters! They help you feel happier and more relaxed.\n\n### Burns Off Extra Energy\nStress can make you feel jumpy or restless. Moving your body helps use up this extra energy so you feel calmer.\n\n### Helps You Sleep Better\nRegular exercise helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly. Getting enough good sleep makes a real difference in how you handle stress.\n\n### Takes Your Mind Off Worries\nWhen you focus on moving your body, your brain gets a break from thinking about what's stressing you out.\n\n![Image: Simple diagram showing how exercise affects the brain with arrows connecting movement to positive outcomes]\n\n## Stress-Busting Moves You Can Try at Home\n\nTry these activities when you're feeling stressed. You don't need special equipment or a lot of space!\n\n### 1. Tension Release Stretches\n**What you need:** Just your body and enough space to stretch your arms out\n**Time needed:** 5 minutes\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart\n2. Take a deep breath in while raising your shoulders up to your ears\n3. Hold for 3 seconds, feeling the tension\n4. Breathe out and drop your shoulders down, releasing all the tension\n5. Repeat 5 times\n6. Try the same with other body parts - make fists then release, scrunch your face then relax\n\n**Safety tip:** Never stretch to the point of pain. You should feel a gentle pull, not sharp pain.\n\n![Image: Simple illustrations showing the shoulder tension-release sequence]\n\n### 2. Energy Burners\n**What you need:** A small space where you can move freely\n**Time needed:** 3-5 minutes\n\nChoose from these quick moves:\n- Jumping jacks - Do 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds, repeat 3 times\n- Invisible jump rope - Pretend to jump rope for 1 minute\n- Dance party - Put on your favourite song and dance however you want!\n\n**Modification:** If you need to stay quiet, try \"silent\" versions - smaller movements without the jumping.\n\n![Image: Simple illustrations of the three energy-burning activities]\n\n### 3. Calm-Down Corner\n**What you need:** A quiet spot where you can sit comfortably\n**Time needed:** 5 minutes\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Find a comfortable sitting position\n2. Place one hand on your belly\n3. Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts (feel your belly expand)\n4. Hold your breath for 2 counts\n5. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 6 counts\n6. Repeat 10 times\n\n**Tip:** This is called \"belly breathing\" and it helps calm your nervous system quickly!\n\n![Image: Illustration of a person doing belly breathing with arrows showing the breath movement]\n\n## Know Your Stress Signals\n\nEveryone shows stress differently. Recognizing your personal stress signals helps you catch stress early!\n\n### Stop and Think\nCheck in with your body right now. Do you notice any of these common stress signals?\n\n- Tight jaw or clenched teeth\n- Headache or feeling dizzy\n- Stomachache or butterflies\n- Cold or sweaty hands\n- Racing thoughts\n- Feeling irritable or cranky\n\nCircle or write down the signals you notice when you're stressed. These are YOUR stress warning signs!\n\n![Image: Body outline with common stress points highlighted]\n\n## Over to You!\n\n**Your Stress-Busting Plan**\n1. Pick one movement activity from this lesson that you want to try\n2. Decide when you'll do it (after school? before bed?)\n3. Try it for at least 5 minutes\n4. Notice how you feel before and after\n\n**Remember:** Moving your body is just one way to handle stress. Getting enough sleep, talking to someone you trust, and taking breaks are all valuable too!\n\n## Check Your Understanding\nAnswer these questions to see what you've learnt:\n\n1. Name two ways stress can affect your body.\n2. How does exercise help reduce stress?\n3. Which stress-busting activity would you choose if you needed to be quiet?\n4. What are two of your personal stress signals?\n\n## Need Help?\nIf stress feels too big to handle on your own, that's okay! Talk to a trusted adult like a parent, teacher, or school counsellor. They can help you find more ways to manage stress.\n</EDITED_TEXT>",
