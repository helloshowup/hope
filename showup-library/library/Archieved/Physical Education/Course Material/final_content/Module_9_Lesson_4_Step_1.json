Try each one and notice how your body feels after.\n\n## Short Relaxation Breaks (5-10 minutes)\nWhen you have a little more time, these activities help your mind and body reset:\n\n**Relaxing Your Muscles**\n1. Find a comfortable spot to sit or lie down\n2. Start at your toes and squeeze them tight for 5 seconds\n3. Release and feel them relax\n4.

Picture your bubble filled with your favourite colour\n5. Breathe deeply and feel safe in your bubble for 3-5 minutes\n\n> **Safety Tip:** If any movement causes pain, stop right away.

Find a quiet spot where you won't be disturbed\n2. Sit or lie down comfortably\n3. Close your eyes and take 5 deep breaths\n4. Imagine a place where you feel completely safe and happy\n5. What do you see there? What sounds do you hear?\n6. Can you feel the temperature? Are there any smells?\n7. Spend 10 minutes exploring this special place in your mind\n8. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes\n\n**Gentle Movement Flow**\n1. Start by standing tall, feet hip-width apart\n2. Raise your arms slowly as you breathe in\n3. Lower them as you breathe out\n4. Gently bend forward, only as far as feels comfortable\n5. Roll back up slowly, one vertebra at a time (that means one back bone at a time)\n6. Repeat this flow 5-10 times, moving with your breath\n7. End by standing still and noticing how your body feels\n\n![Image: A student demonstrating the standing tall position with proper alignment]\n\n> **Adapt It!** If you don't have much space, you can do the Gentle Movement Flow sitting in a chair.
