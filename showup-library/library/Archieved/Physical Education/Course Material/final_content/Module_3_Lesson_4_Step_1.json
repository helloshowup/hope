You'll spot patterns in your exercise habits, set goals that work for you, and tweak your routine to boost your fitness. By paying attention to your cardio activities, you'll develop skills to monitor your progress and make healthier choices.\n\n## Why It Matters\nKeeping tabs on your workouts is a bit like being your own fitness detective! When you jot down your activities, you can see what's working and what isn't. This helps you make smarter choices about exercise and builds habits that can keep you healthy for years to come. These self-monitoring skills won't just help with fitness\u2014they'll come in handy in lots of areas of your life.\n\n## Get Ready\nYou'll need:\n- A cardio log worksheet (your teacher will provide this)\n- A pencil or pen\n- A timer or stopwatch (or a phone with a timer app)\n- Comfortable clothes for movement\n\n## Let's Begin!\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Your Cardio Log (10 minutes)\nYour cardio log helps you keep track of your exercise. On your log, you'll record:\n- What type of cardio activity you did (like jumping jacks or running in place)\n- How long you exercised (in minutes)\n- How hard it felt (on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is very easy and 5 is super challenging)\n- How you felt during and after (energised, tired, happy, etc.)\n\nHave a look at your cardio log worksheet. Can you find where you'll record each bit of information? Your teacher will show you an example of how to fill it out properly.\n\n### Step 2: Get Moving! (15-20 minutes)\nTime to try a cardio activity! Your teacher will guide you through a workout using some of the home-based cardio exercises you learnt about before, such as:\n- Jumping jacks\n- High knees (running in place while lifting your knees high)\n- Butt kicks (jogging while kicking your heels toward your bottom)\n- Mountain climbers (in a push-up position, bringing knees to chest one at a time)\n\nAs you exercise, notice how your body feels. Is your heart beating faster? Are you breathing harder? Do some activities feel easier or harder than others? These observations will help you fill out your log.\n\n### Step 3: Record Your Activity (5 minutes)\nRight after your workout, fill out your cardio log while everything is fresh in your mind. Be honest about how the activity felt - this isn't about impressing anyone, it's about getting to know yourself better!\n\n### Step 4: Over to You (10 minutes)\nThink about these questions and chat with a partner or small group:\n- Which activities did you enjoy most? Why?\n- Which activities felt the most challenging?\n- How did your body feel during different parts of the workout?\n- How do you feel now, after completing the workout?\n- What might you do differently next time?\n\n### Step 5: Set a Personal Cardio Goal (10 minutes)\nBased on today's experience, set one specific goal for your cardio fitness. Your goal should be:\n- Specific (exactly what you want to accomplish)\n- Measurable (how you'll know if you've reached it)\n- Achievable (something you can realistically do)\n- Relevant (important to you personally)\n- Time-bound (when you plan to achieve it)\n\nFor example: \"I will do 10 minutes of jumping jacks and high knees three times a week for the next two weeks.\"\n\nWrite your goal in your cardio log and share it with a partner.\n\n## Wrap-Up\nToday you learnt how to track and reflect on your cardio activities. Keeping a cardio log helps you spot patterns, set better goals, and make adjustments to improve your fitness. This self-monitoring skill will help you develop healthier exercise habits that stick.\n\nNext time, we'll explore different muscle groups in your body and how they work together during exercise. Your cardio log will help you connect what you've learnt about cardiovascular fitness with our upcoming focus on strength and flexibility.\n\n## Check Your Understanding\n1. Why is tracking your cardio activities so valuable?\n2. What four pieces of information should you record in your cardio log?\n3. How can spotting patterns in your exercise habits help improve your fitness?\n4. What makes a good fitness goal?\n5. How might tracking your cardio activities connect to our next lesson about muscles?\n\n## Take It Further\n- Try using your cardio log at home for different activities like walking, dancing, or playing active games\n- Create a colourful or decorated cover for your cardio log to make it more personal\n- Interview a family member about how they track their exercise or health habits\n- Research apps or websites that help people track their fitness activities\n</Edited Text>",
