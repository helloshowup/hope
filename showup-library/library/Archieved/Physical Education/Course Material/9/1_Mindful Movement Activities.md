## Let's Get Started! (5 minutes)
When was the last time you got moving outside of school? Perhaps you kicked a ball around at the park, cycled down a local path, or splashed about in a swimming pool. Where did this happen? Did it cost anything?

You might be surprised by how many different ways you can stay active in your community - even with limited space, money, or equipment!

## Places to Be Active in Your Community (10 minutes)

### Parks and Playgrounds
Parks offer brilliant opportunities to get moving for free! Most communities have parks with:

Community centres often have low-cost programmes or free days for students.

## Finding Information About Activities (10 minutes)

### How to Find Out What's Available
Tracking down activities is a bit like detective work! Here's how to discover what's happening near you:

1. **Look online:** Check your city's website or parks department page
2. **Scan bulletin boards:** Libraries and grocery stores often post flyers about local activities
3. **Ask around:** Chat with friends, neighbours, or teachers about activities they enjoy
4. **Social media:** Many community groups share updates about events online

### Activity: Become a Fitness Detective
Pick one place in your community where you might want to be active. Use the internet to find:
- The location (address)
- Hours it's open
- Cost (if any)
- What activities you can do there
- Any special equipment you need to bring

Jot down what you discover so you can try it later!

## Free and Low-Cost Ways to Stay Active (10 minutes)

You don't need fancy equipment or expensive memberships to get moving! Here are some free or cheap ways to be active:

### At Parks or Outside
- Walking or jogging around your neighbourhood
- Playing tag or catch with family members

- Nature scavenger hunts

### At Home

- Creating a hopscotch pattern with tape on the floor
- Using stairs for step exercises

**Safety Tip:** Always tell an adult where you're going when you exercise outside. Stick to safe areas and avoid exercising alone.
