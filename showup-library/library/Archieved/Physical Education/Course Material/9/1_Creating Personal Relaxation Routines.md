Stress affects everyone - even kids and teens. The good news? You can learn simple techniques to manage it. This lesson will help you create your own personalised collection of relaxation methods that work specifically for you. Think of it like having different tools for different jobs - quick fixes when you're overwhelmed, short breaks to recharge, and deeper practises when you have more time.

- Try 15-minute calming routines when you have more time
- Choose the right technique for different situations
- Create your own special calm-down space at home

## Quick Stress-Busters (1-2 minutes)
When stress hits suddenly, these quick techniques can help you feel better fast:

**Deep Breathing**
1. Sit up straight or stand tall
2. Breathe in slowly through your nose while counting to 4
3. Hold your breath for a count of 2
4. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of 6
5. Repeat 3 times

**Stretch It Out**
1. Reach your arms up high like you're trying to touch the sky
2. Slowly bend to one side, then the other
3. Roll your shoulders backward 5 times
4. Gently turn your head from side to side

**The 5-4-3-2-1 Game**
Look around and find:
- 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

> **Over to You!** Which quick stress-buster makes you feel most relaxed? Try each one and notice how your body feels after.

## Short Relaxation Breaks (5-10 minutes)
When you have a little more time, these activities help your mind and body reset:

**Relaxing Your Muscles**
1. Find a comfortable spot to sit or lie down
2. Start at your toes and squeeze them tight for 5 seconds
3. Release and feel them relax
4. Move up to your feet, then legs, and continue all the way to your face
5. Notice how different your body feels when you finish

**Mini Movement Break**
1. March in place for 30 seconds
2. Do 10 arm circles forward and backward
3. Stretch your arms out wide, then give yourself a hug
4. Gently twist your upper body from side to side
5. End with 5 deep breaths

**Calm Bubble**
1. Sit in a comfortable position
2. Close your eyes or look at one spot
3. Imagine yourself inside a giant, protective bubble
4. Picture your bubble filled with your favourite colour
5. Breathe deeply and feel safe in your bubble for 3-5 minutes

> **Safety Tip:** If any movement causes pain, stop right away. These activities should feel good, not hurt!

## Longer Calming Practices (15-20 minutes)
For deeper relaxation when you have more time:

**Peaceful Place Journey**
1. Find a quiet spot where you won't be disturbed
2. Sit or lie down comfortably
3. Close your eyes and take 5 deep breaths
4. Imagine a place where you feel completely safe and happy
5. What do you see there? What sounds do you hear?
6. Can you feel the temperature? Are there any smells?
7. Spend 10 minutes exploring this special place in your mind
8. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes

**Gentle Movement Flow**
1. Start by standing tall, feet hip-width apart
2. Raise your arms slowly as you breathe in
3. Lower them as you breathe out
4. Gently bend forward, only as far as feels comfortable
5. Roll back up slowly, one vertebra at a time (that means one back bone at a time)
6. Repeat this flow 5-10 times, moving with your breath
7. End by standing still and noticing how your body feels

> **Adapt It!** If you don't have much space, you can do the Gentle Movement Flow sitting in a chair. Just make the movements smaller!

## Creating Your Calm-Down Space
Having a special place for relaxation makes a real difference. Here's how to create your own calm-down corner:

**What You Need:**
- A comfortable spot to sit or lie down

2. Make it comfortable with pillows or blankets
3. Add things that make you happy (photos, drawings, special items)
4. Keep it clean and organised

**No Space? No Problem!**
If you don't have much room, try these ideas:
- Use a special pillow that becomes your "calm spot"
- Create a small box with calming items you can take anywhere
- Hang a picture that reminds you to breathe and relax
