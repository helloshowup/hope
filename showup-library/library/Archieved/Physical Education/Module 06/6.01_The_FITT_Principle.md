## What is the FITT Principle?

Have you ever wondered how athletes and fitness coaches plan their workouts? They don't just make things up as they go! Most of them use something called the FITT Principle. FITT is like a recipe for exercise that helps you get the results you want. Just like you need the right ingredients to bake cookies, you need the right mix of exercise components to reach your fitness goals.

The letters in FITT stand for Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type. Think of these as the building blocks of any good workout plan. When you understand these four parts, you can create your own exercise routine that's perfect for YOU - not just copying what someone else does. In this lesson, we'll explore each part of FITT and show you how to build your very own fitness plan!

## Exploring Each Part of FITT

### Frequency

Let's talk about frequency first - it's probably the easiest part of FITT to understand! Frequency is just a fancy word for "how often" you do something. Think about your favorite TV show - maybe you watch it once a week when a new episode comes out. That's the frequency of your TV watching! With exercise, frequency means how many days each week you get your body moving. Finding the right frequency is like solving a puzzle - too little exercise and you won't see results, but too much without rest can make you tired or even injured.

Frequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:

- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week
- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover
- You don't have to do the same thing every day
- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting

**Activity**: Look at your weekly schedule and mark specific days and times when you can exercise. For example:
- Monday: 4:00-4:30 PM
- Wednesday: 3:30-4:00 PM
- Saturday: 10:00-10:30 AM

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about your current weekly routine - do you already have regular activities that count as exercise (like sports practice, walking the dog, or riding your bike)? How might you build on what you're already doing?

### Intensity

Have you ever noticed how some activities make your heart pound and leave you breathing hard, while others barely make you break a sweat? That difference is what we call intensity! Intensity is like the volume knob on your exercise - you can turn it up when you want a bigger challenge or turn it down when you need something easier. The cool thing about intensity is that YOU control it based on how you're feeling that day. Some days you might have tons of energy for high-intensity exercise, while other days you might need something gentler. Learning to measure your own intensity is an important skill that even professional athletes use!

Intensity means how hard your body is working. Here are two ways to measure it on your own:

**Talk Test**: 
  1. During activity, try to say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing a verse of your favorite song
  2. If you can talk comfortably = low intensity
  3. If you can talk but not sing = medium intensity
  4. If you can barely talk = high intensity

**Scale of Effort**: 
  1. During activity, rate your effort from 1-10
  2. 1-3 = easy (like walking slowly)
  3. 4-6 = medium (breathing harder but can continue)
  4. 7-10 = hard (breathing very hard, can't continue long)

**Activity**: Try these three exercises for 30 seconds each:
1. Walking in place
2. Jogging in place
3. Jumping jacks

<br/>

---stopandreflect---
**CHECKPOINT:** After each one, immediately write down: Your effort score (1-10) and whether you could talk easily, with difficulty, or barely at all. How did the intensity feel different between these three simple activities?

### Time

Time is all about how long your exercise sessions last. Think of time like a movie - some are short (like a 30-minute TV show), and others are longer (like a 2-hour superhero movie). Both can be great, but they feel different! The same goes for exercise. A quick 10-minute workout might be perfect when you're busy with homework, while a longer 45-minute session might be fun on the weekend. The good news is that even short bursts of activity count toward your daily total. So if you can't find a big chunk of time, don't worry - you can break it up into smaller, bite-sized pieces throughout your day!

Time refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:

- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day
- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too (like 10 minutes in the morning, 10 at lunch, and 10 after school)

**Activity**: Use a timer (phone, clock, or kitchen timer) for these practice sessions:
1. Do any movement (march in place, dance, etc.) for 1 minute
2. Rest for 30 seconds
3. Repeat 3 times

<br/>

**CHECKPOINT:** How did it feel? Was it too short, too long, or just right? Think about your daily schedule - when could you fit in short movement breaks like this throughout your day?

### Type

Type is all about WHAT kind of exercise you choose to do. It's like picking what to watch on TV - sometimes you want an action movie, sometimes a comedy, and other times a documentary. Your body benefits from different types of movement just like your brain enjoys different types of shows! The three main exercise types - cardio, strength, and flexibility - each help your body in different ways. Mixing them up keeps exercise fun and gives you more complete fitness. The best part is that you get to pick activities you actually enjoy - because the best exercise plan is one that you'll actually want to do!

Type is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types:

<br/>
1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping

- Examples you can do at home: Jogging in place, jumping jacks, dancing to music, climbing stairs

2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle

- Examples with no equipment: Push-ups against a wall, squats, lunges, plank position

3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles

- Examples: Reaching for your toes, arm circles, gentle twists

**Activity**: Try one exercise from each category:
1. Cardio: March in place for 30 seconds
2. Strength: Do 5 wall push-ups (standing arms-length from wall, push against it)
3. Flexibility: Reach arms overhead and gently lean side to side


---stopandreflect---
**CHECKPOINT:** After each one, write down: how it felt in your body, which one you enjoyed most, and which one was most challenging. Which type of exercise do you think you need more of in your current routine?

## Key Takeaways
- The FITT Principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type) provides a framework for creating balanced exercise plans that can be personalized to your specific needs and goals.
- Measuring your exercise intensity through the talk test or effort scale helps you adjust workouts to the right level for your fitness, making activities more effective and safer.
- A complete fitness routine includes all three types of exercise (cardio, strength, and flexibility), which can be mixed throughout the week in sessions as short as 10 minutes.
