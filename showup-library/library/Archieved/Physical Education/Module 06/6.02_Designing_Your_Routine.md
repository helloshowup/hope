## Creating Your Own FITT Plan

Follow these steps to create your personal FITT plan:

1. **Set a measurable goal**: Complete this sentence: "In 4 weeks, I want to be able to ___________."
   Examples:
   - Run in place for 5 minutes without stopping
   - Do 10 push-ups in a row
   - Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight

2. **Fill in your FITT plan worksheet**:

   | Component | My Plan | Why I Chose This |
   |-----------|---------|------------------|
   | Frequency | ___ days per week | |
   | Intensity | ___ out of 10 | |
   | Time | ___ minutes per session | |
   | Type | List specific activities: | |

3. **Create a weekly schedule**: Write down exactly when you'll exercise each day:

   | Day | Time | Activity | Location in Home |
   |-----|------|----------|------------------|
   | Monday | | | |
   | Tuesday | | | |
   | Wednesday | | | |
   | Thursday | | | |
   | Friday | | | |
   | Saturday | | | |
   | Sunday | | | |

4. **Progress tracking**: After each workout, record:
   - Date and time
   - What you did
   - How long you did it
   - How it felt (1-10 scale)
   - One thing you're proud of
   - One thing to improve next time

## Sample FITT Plans for Students

Here are some example FITT plans with activities you can do at home:

**For Beginners:**
- **Frequency**: 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Intensity**: Medium (4-5 out of 10)

  - Thursday: Interval training (30 seconds hard, 30 seconds easy) - Intensity 8/10
  - Friday: Flexibility (stretching routine) - Intensity 4/10

## Troubleshooting Your FITT Plan

Solutions for common challenges you might face:

**If you don't have enough space:**
- Focus on stationary exercises (planks, push-ups, squats)
- Use a chair for step-ups instead of running
- Try "traveling" exercises in a small path (2-3 steps forward and back)

**If you don't have equipment:**
- Books in a backpack = weights
- A towel = resistance band (pull it tight between hands)
- Stairs = cardio machine
- Chair = workout bench

**If you're not sure you're doing exercises correctly:**
1. Take a photo or video of yourself
2. Compare to example images provided
3. Check these key points:
   - Back straight, not rounded
   - Knees aligned with toes, not caving inward
   - Movements controlled, not rushed

## Adjusting Your FITT Plan

After following your plan for one week, use this self-assessment checklist:

- [ ] I completed all my planned workout sessions
- [ ] The intensity level felt appropriate (challenging but doable)
- [ ] I had enough energy to complete each session
- [ ] I enjoyed at least some of the activities
- [ ] I'm seeing or feeling small improvements

Based on your answers, here's how to adjust:

**If it feels too easy** (you checked all boxes and felt you could do more):
1. Keep frequency the same
2. Increase just ONE of these:
   - Intensity: Add 1-2 points to your target effort level
   - Time: Add 5 minutes to your sessions
   - Type: Try the more challenging version of an exercise (regular push-ups instead of wall push-ups)

**If it feels too hard** (you couldn't check most boxes):
1. Keep frequency the same
2. Decrease just ONE of these:
   - Intensity: Lower your target effort by 2-3 points
   - Time: Reduce sessions by 5-10 minutes
   - Type: Try the easier version of exercises (wall push-ups instead of regular)

**If you get bored:**
1. Keep your schedule and timing the same
2. Swap activities for similar ones:
   - Instead of jogging in place, try dancing
   - Instead of regular push-ups, try them with hands in different positions
   - Add music to your workout

**Success indicators** - You'll know your plan is working when:
- You can complete all sessions without excessive fatigue
- Your breathing recovers faster after exercise
- Movements that were once hard become easier
- You look forward to (at least some) exercise sessions
- You can do more repetitions or time than when you started

Remember, the FITT Principle gives you the power to create your own personalized fitness plan. By understanding and adjusting the Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of your workouts, you can design an exercise routine that fits your schedule, matches your interests, and helps you reach your goals. Fitness isn't about being perfect - it's about discovering what your amazing body can do!

## Setting Up Your Home Fitness Space

Finding the right spot in your home to exercise makes a big difference in how much you'll enjoy working out. You don't need a huge space - just a small area where you can move freely without bumping into furniture or worrying about breaking things. Many students find that moving a coffee table or pushing a bed to one side creates enough room for most activities.

Before creating your routine, set up a dedicated space for exercise:

**Basic Setup Requirements:**
- Clear a space at least 6 feet by 6 feet (enough to lie down with arms extended)
- Remove any breakable items or tripping hazards
- Have a water bottle nearby for hydration
- Use a towel or yoga mat for floor exercises if available (a folded blanket works too)

**Troubleshooting Common Space Issues:**
- Limited space? Focus on stationary exercises and clear just enough room to stand with arms extended
- Noisy environment? Use headphones for workout videos or create a visual exercise chart
- Shared space? Schedule your workout time when fewer people are around or create a portable workout kit in a box

## Setting Realistic Weekly Goals

When you're just starting out with fitness, it's easy to get super excited and plan to exercise every single day for an hour. But that's kind of like deciding to read an entire book in one night - it's too much at once! Instead, think about what you can actually do with your current schedule and energy level. Maybe that's just 15 minutes three times a week to begin with, and that's perfectly okay. The most important thing is to start with something you can definitely accomplish.

Let's create some concrete goals to help you succeed:

1. Fill in this specific goal template in your notebook:
   "By the end of this month, I want to be able to _____ (specific physical achievement)."
   Examples:
   - Walk continuously for 15 minutes
   - Do 10 proper push-ups (or 10 modified push-ups on knees)
   - Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight

2. Look at your actual schedule and mark exactly when you have 15-30 minute blocks available for exercise. Count how many blocks you have each week.

3. Write down 3 physical activities you genuinely enjoy or are curious to try.

Starting with smaller goals and building up gives you much better results than trying to do too much at once!

## Balancing Different Types of Activities

Think of your weekly exercise plan like making a sandwich - you need different ingredients to make it taste good and give you energy. Just doing one type of exercise, like only push-ups every day, would be like eating a sandwich with just bread! Your body works best when you give it different types of movement throughout the week.

Include these different types of movement:

**Cardio Days (2-3 times weekly):** Activities that speed up your heart and breathing:
- Walking or jogging around your neighbourhood
- Marching or jogging in place (perfect for small spaces)
- Dancing to music you love
- Jumping jacks or jump rope (use an imaginary rope if you don't have one)

**How to know you're doing cardio right:** You should be breathing harder than normal but still able to speak in short sentences. If you can sing easily, increase intensity; if you can't talk at all, decrease intensity.

**Strength Days (2 times weekly):** Exercises that build muscle:
- Bodyweight moves like push-ups, squats, and lunges
- Household item weights:
  - Filled water bottles (16-20 oz) for light weights
  - Backpack with books for heavier weights
  - Canned goods for small hand weights

**Beginner strength circuit (repeat 2-3 times):**
1. 10 wall push-ups (standing at arm's length from wall)
2. 10 chair squats (lower until you almost touch a chair seat)
3. 10 standing calf raises
4. 30-second rest

**Flexibility/Recovery Days (1-2 times weekly):** Helping your body stretch and recover:
- Basic stretching routine (hold each stretch for 30 seconds):
  - Reach for toes (hamstring stretch)
  - Arm across chest (shoulder stretch)
  - Gentle neck tilts (side to side)
  - Calf stretch against wall
- Simple yoga poses: child's pose, downward dog, gentle twists

**Fun Activity Days (1-2 times weekly):** Things you actually look forward to:
- Solo sports practice (shooting baskets, kicking soccer ball against wall)
- Follow-along dance videos
- Exploring your neighborhood on foot or bike
- Active video games

## Activity Selection Exercise

Now it's time to put your plan into action! The chart below will help you organize your thoughts and create a fitness routine that works for you. Think about when you have free time during the week - maybe after school before dinner, or on weekend mornings.

## Sample Weekly Schedules for Beginners

Looking at a blank schedule can sometimes feel overwhelming - where do you even start? Here are some sample weekly plans to give you ideas:

**Beginner Schedule:**
- Monday: 20-minute walk around your home or neighbourhood (cardio)
- Tuesday: 15 minutes of basic exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and squats (strength)
- Wednesday: Rest day or light stretching
- Thursday: 20-minute bike ride or marching in place at home (cardio)
- Friday: 15 minutes of yoga or stretching (flexibility)
- Saturday: Practice basketball skills or another sport by yourself for 30 minutes (fun activity)
- Sunday: Rest day

**Success Indicators:** You've successfully completed this beginner schedule if:
- You completed at least 4 of the 5 active days
- You were able to finish each session without excessive fatigue
- Your breathing returned to normal within 5 minutes after cardio activities
- You felt some muscle challenge during strength exercises but could complete all repetitions

As you get stronger and build more stamina, you might want to try this:

**Intermediate Schedule:**
- Monday: 30-minute jog or fast walk (cardio)
- Tuesday: 20 minutes of strength exercises with resistance bands or household items (strength)
- Wednesday: 20 minutes of yoga following an online video (flexibility)
- Thursday: 30 minutes of dancing to your favorite music or cycling (cardio)
- Friday: Rest day
- Saturday: 45 minutes practicing sports skills or playing an active game (fun activity)
- Sunday: 15 minutes of stretching (recovery)

## Troubleshooting Common Exercise Challenges

Even with the best plans, you'll probably run into some roadblocks along the way. That's totally normal! Everyone faces challenges with exercise - even Olympic athletes have days when they don't feel like working out. The key is to have some strategies ready for when these situations come up.

- **If you feel pain (not just muscle fatigue):** Stop immediately, rest, and try a modified version next time
- **If you get bored:** Create a workout playlist with your favorite upbeat songs or exercise during a TV show
- **If you're too tired:** Try exercising at a different time of day or reduce the intensity but maintain frequency
- **If you forget to exercise:** Set a daily alarm on your phone or link exercise to another daily habit (like before dinner)

## Keeping Exercise Interesting with Variety

Have you ever had a favorite food that you ate so often you got tired of it? The same thing can happen with exercise! Doing the exact same workout day after day gets boring for both your brain and your body. Your muscles actually adapt to repeated movements, which means you'll stop seeing improvements after a while.

Here are ways to mix things up:

- Try one new activity each month
- Create milestone challenges: Track your progress toward specific achievements like 10 push-ups or a 1-minute plank
- Change your environment: Rotate between different areas in/around your home
- Create themed workout days: "Music Monday" with favorite songs, "Challenge Tuesday" with new exercises
- Track progress: Keep a simple chart showing which days you exercised and one improvement you noticed

## Key Takeaways

- A balanced fitness routine includes different types of activities (cardio, strength, flexibility, and fun) spread throughout the week to keep your body healthy and prevent boredom.
- Creating a successful fitness plan means setting realistic goals, using items you already have at home, and scheduling activities at specific times that fit your life.
- Tracking your progress and making adjustments to your plan helps you stay motivated and continue improving your fitness over time.
