## Lesson 2.3: Body Awareness and Spatial Concepts

### Home Setup Instructions
"Finding the right space for movement activities can be tricky at home, but with a little creativity, you can make almost any area work. Take a few minutes to scout out a good spot in your home - maybe it's a corner of your living room, a section of your bedroom with the rug rolled back, or even a hallway. The important thing is having enough room to move safely without bumping into furniture or walls." - Lesson 2.3, 2.3 Body Awareness and Spatial Concepts

"Before starting this lesson, you'll need:
- An open area approximately 6x6 feet (minimum)
- 3 pieces of paper and a marker for making signs
- A timer or stopwatch (phone timer works great)
- Optional: Music player
- Comfortable clothes that allow movement" - Lesson 2.3, 2.3 Body Awareness and Spatial Concepts

"If space is limited:
- Focus on stationary movements and smaller steps
- Use a hallway for directional movements
- Clear a small area of furniture temporarily" - Lesson 2.3, 2.3 Body Awareness and Spatial Concepts

"Adaptation for limited space: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements." - Lesson 2.3, 2.3 Body Awareness and Spatial Concepts
