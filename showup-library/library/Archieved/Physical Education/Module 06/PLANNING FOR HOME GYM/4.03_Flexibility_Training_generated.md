# 4.3 Flexibility Training

## Setting Up Your Stretching Space
Before you begin stretching at home:

1. **Clear a space** at least 6 feet by 6 feet where you can move freely.
2. **Find a non-slip surface** - a carpet, exercise mat, or even a folded blanket works well.
3. **Have a sturdy chair or wall nearby** for balance during standing stretches.
4. **Wear comfortable clothes** that allow you to move freely.
5. **Remove distractions** - turn off the TV and put your phone away.
6. **Have water nearby** to stay hydrated.

If you don't have an exercise mat, alternatives include:
- A folded blanket or beach towel
- A non-slip rug
- A carpeted area of your home

## Materials Needed
- Exercise mat (or alternatives: folded blanket, beach towel, non-slip rug, or carpeted area)
- Sturdy chair or wall for balance support
- Comfortable clothing that allows free movement
- Water bottle
- Open space (at least 6 feet by 6 feet)
