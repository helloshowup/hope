# Setting Up Your Home Exercise Space

## Lesson 4.2 - Bodyweight Training: Using Your Body to Get Stronger!

"Before starting, create a safe exercise space:
1. **Clear a space**: Remove any furniture, toys, or objects that might get in your way or cause trips
2. **Surface check**: Find a carpeted area or use an exercise mat (a folded blanket works too!)
3. **Water station**: Keep a water bottle nearby to stay hydrated
4. **Clothing**: Wear comfortable clothes that let you move freely
5. **Timer**: Have a clock, watch, or phone timer ready to track exercise time

<br/>
If you don't have much space, that's okay! Most of these exercises need only enough room to lie down with arms extended." - Lesson 4.2, Bodyweight Training: Using Your Body to Get Stronger!
