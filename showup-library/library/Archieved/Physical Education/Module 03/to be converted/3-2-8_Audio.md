Complete these gentle stretching exercises at your own pace:

Reach for the sky, then touch toes (or as far as comfortable) (10 seconds each)
Gentle arm across chest stretch (15 seconds each arm)
Quad stretch holding one foot behind you (use a wall for balance if needed) (15 seconds each leg)
Butterfly stretch for inner thighs (20 seconds)

While stretching, consider these questions:
- Which exercise challenged you the most today? Why?
- How could you use these exercises at home?
- What's one thing you discovered about bodyweight training today?
- When might bodyweight exercises be more useful than using gym equipment?
