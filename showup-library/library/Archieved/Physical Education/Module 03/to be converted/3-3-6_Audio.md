Script title: Invisible Jump Rope Technique
File name: 3-3-6.mp3
Content to be covered:
**Basic:** Pretend to hold a jump rope, making small jumps while rotating your wrists.

**Easier:** Simply tap one foot forward at a time without jumping.

**Harder:** Add variations like side-to-side jumps or single-leg hops.

Practice each exercise for about 30 seconds (or whatever feels comfortable), resting for 15-20 seconds between activities.
