Content to be covered:
**Basic:** Stand with feet together and arms at your sides. Jump to spread your feet wide while raising your arms overhead, then jump back to the starting position.

**Easier:** Step one foot out at a time instead of jumping.

**Harder:** Add a squat when your feet are in the wide position.
