Discover how exercise affects your own heart with this simple activity:

**What you'll need:** A timer that shows seconds (your phone works perfectly)

**Step 1:** Find your pulse by pressing two fingers (not your thumb) against your wrist or neck. Count the beats for 15 seconds, then multiply by 4. This number represents your resting heart rate.

**Step 2:** Do jumping jacks or jog in place for about a minute (or as long as comfortable).

**Step 3:** Immediately check your pulse again using the same method. Notice the increase in your heart rate.

**Step 4:** Rest for a few minutes, then check your pulse once more. Watch how your heart rate gradually returns to normal.

**Think About:**
- What caused your heart rate to climb during exercise?
- How might your heart respond differently after several weeks of regular exercise?
- Which activities make your heart beat fastest?

Jot down what you noticed in a notebook. Writing helps cement your understanding of how your heart adapts to physical challenges.
