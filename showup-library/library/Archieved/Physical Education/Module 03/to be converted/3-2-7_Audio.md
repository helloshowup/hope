Content to be covered:
5. **Superman Holds** (for back strength)

- Easier: Alternating arm and leg raises
- Standard: Full superman hold for 10-15 seconds (lift arms and legs off floor while lying on stomach)
- Harder: Superman with arm and leg pulses

Important reminders:
- Remember to breathe regularly during exercises
- Good form matters more than doing lots of repetitions
- Stop if you feel pain (not just the challenge of the exercise)
- Exercises often feel difficult at first - that's normal and part of getting stronger
