# Heart Rate Exploration Activity
## Understanding Your Cardiovascular Response to Exercise

### Purpose
This activity helps you observe how your heart responds to physical activity and recovery, demonstrating the cardiovascular system's adaptability.

---

### Materials Needed
- Timer or stopwatch (smartphone timer works well)
- Space to move around safely

---

### Activity Instructions

#### Step 1: Measure Your Resting Heart Rate
1. Sit quietly for 2-3 minutes to ensure you're at rest
2. Place two fingers (not your thumb) gently on your:
   - **Wrist** (radial pulse) - on the thumb side of your inner wrist
   - **OR Neck** (carotid pulse) - just below your jawline
3. Count pulse beats for 15 seconds
4. Multiply by 4 to get beats per minute (BPM)

**My Resting Heart Rate:** ________ BPM

---

#### Step 2: Exercise
1. Perform jumping jacks or jog in place for 60 seconds
2. Try to maintain consistent intensity throughout

---

#### Step 3: Measure Exercise Heart Rate
1. **Immediately** after stopping exercise, find your pulse
2. Count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4

**My Exercise Heart Rate:** ________ BPM

---

#### Step 4: Recovery Tracking
1. Rest completely for 2 minutes
2. Measure your heart rate again using the same method

**My 2-Minute Recovery Heart Rate:** ________ BPM

### Data Collection Table

| Measurement Point | Heart Rate (BPM) | How I Felt (breathing, energy, etc.) |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Resting           |                  |                                      |
| After Exercise    |                  |                                      |
| 2-Min Recovery    |                  |                                      |

### Reflection Questions

1. How much did your heart rate increase during exercise? ________

2. After 2 minutes of rest, how close was your heart rate to your resting rate?
   _________________________________________________________________

3. What do you think would happen to your recovery time if you exercised regularly for several weeks?

### Key Concepts to Remember
- **Heart rate** increases during exercise to deliver more oxygen to working muscles
- **Recovery rate** (how quickly your heart rate returns to normal) improves with regular exercise
- A **stronger heart** pumps more blood with each beat, becoming more efficient over time
