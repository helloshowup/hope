Script title: Proper Warm-up Routine
File name: 3-2-1.mp3
Content to be covered:
A proper warm-up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles. Try these exercises at your own pace:

Jumping jacks (about 30 seconds, or until you feel warm)
Arm circles (about 15 seconds forward, 15 seconds backward)
High knees in place (about 30 seconds, go at your own speed)
Bodyweight squats (10 slow squats)
Shoulder rolls (10 forward, 10 backward)

Warming up is important because it:
- Sends blood to your muscles
- Increases muscle flexibility and helps prevent injuries
- Prepares both your body and mind for exercise
