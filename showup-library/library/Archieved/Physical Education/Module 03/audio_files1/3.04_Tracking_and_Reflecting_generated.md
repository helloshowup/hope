# 3.4 Tracking and Reflecting on Cardio Activities

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Fill out a cardio log to track your workouts
- Create a SMART fitness goal for yourself
- Explain how your body feels during and after exercise

## Why It Matters
Keeping track of your workouts is like being a fitness detective! Your cardio log shows what exercises make you feel great and which ones might not be right for you. These records help you make smarter choices about staying active and building healthy habits that stick. The skills you learn from tracking your exercise will be super helpful in other parts of your life too!

You'll need:

- A cardio log worksheet (you can print this from your course materials)
- A pencil or pen
- A timer or stopwatch (your phone timer works great too!)
- Comfy clothes you can move around in

## Let's Begin!

### Step 1: Getting to Know Your Cardio Log 
Your cardio log is like a fitness diary where you'll write down:

- What cardio activity you did (like jumping jacks or running in place)
- How long you exercised (in minutes)
- How hard it felt (on a scale where 1=super easy and 5=really tough!)
- How your body and mind felt during and after (energized? tired? happy?)

Take a quick look at your cardio log worksheet. Can you find all the different boxes where you'll record this information? Check out the example in your materials to see what a filled-out log looks like.

### Step 2: Time to Get Your Heart Pumping! 
Let's try some fun cardio exercises you can do right at home, even in a small space:

- **Jumping Jacks**: Start standing with your feet together and arms at your sides. Then jump while spreading your legs and raising your arms over your head - like making a star shape with your body! Jump back to the starting position. That's one jumping jack!

- **High Knees**: March in place, but try to bring your knees up as high as you can toward your chest. It's like you're trying to run through deep mud!

- **Butt Kicks**: Jog in place while trying to kick your heels up toward your bottom. Imagine you're trying to kick yourself in the behind!

- **Mountain Climbers**: Start in a push-up position with your hands on the floor. Bring one knee toward your chest, then switch legs quickly - like you're climbing a mountain on your hands!

Pick 3-4 of these exercises and do each one for 1-2 minutes. If you need a break, rest for 30 seconds between exercises. While you're moving, pay attention to how your body feels - notice your heartbeat getting faster, your breathing changing, and which muscles are working hard. Some activities might feel easier for you than others - that's totally normal!

### Step 3: Write It Down
Right after you finish exercising, grab your cardio log and fill it out while everything is fresh in your mind. Be honest about how the workout felt - this is just for you to learn about yourself, not to impress anyone!

### Step 4: Think About Your Workout
Now that you've finished, take a moment to think about your experience and answer these questions in your notebook:

- Which activities did you have the most fun doing? Why?
- Which activities made you work the hardest?
- How did your body feel during different exercises? (Was your heart racing? Were your muscles burning?)
- How do you feel now that you're done? (Energized? Tired? Proud?)
- What might you change the next time you exercise?

### Step 5: Create Your Own Fitness Goal 
Now that you've tried some cardio activities, let's create a fitness goal just for you. A great goal follows the SMART format:

- **S**pecific: Exactly what you want to do
- **M**easurable: How you'll know when you've done it
- **A**chievable: Something you can actually do (be realistic!)
- **R**elevant: Something that matters to you
- **T**ime-bound: When you plan to finish it

For example: "I will do 10 minutes of jumping jacks and high knees three times a week for the next two weeks."

<br/>
Write your goal in your cardio log. If you can, tell a family member about your goal - sharing it with someone else makes it more likely you'll stick with it!

## Wrap-Up
Today you learned how to be your own fitness coach by tracking and thinking about your cardio activities. Your cardio log is like a fitness map that helps you see what's working, set good goals, and adjust your exercise routine to get healthier. This way of paying attention to your body helps you build exercise habits that last a long time.

As we continue our fitness journey, we'll explore different muscle groups and how they work together when you exercise. The tracking skills you're learning now will connect with our upcoming lessons on strength and flexibility.
