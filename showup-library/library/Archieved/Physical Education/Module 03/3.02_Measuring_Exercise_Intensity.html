<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Show how to do 5 basic bodyweight moves with good form</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Pick the right level of each move for your own fitness</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Create a simple workout you can do at home with no gear</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Bodyweight training lets you build strength and fitness using just your own body weight - no equipment needed! You'll learn different exercises that use your body as resistance, practice proper form to stay safe, and discover how to adjust exercises based on your fitness level. By the end, you'll be able to create simple bodyweight workouts you can do anywhere - at home, the park, or even your bedroom!</p>
<p><br/><br />
You've probably done push-ups or squats before. These classic exercises use your own body as resistance instead of weights or machines.</p>
<p><br/><br />
Bodyweight training has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gymnasts develop their impressive strength mostly through bodyweight exercises</li>
<li>You can exercise anywhere without special equipment</li>
<li>It builds strength and flexibility while also giving you a cardio workout</li>
<li>Many professional athletes regularly do bodyweight exercises</li>
<li>It works perfectly when you're stuck inside or don't have equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>These exercises are especially useful during bad weather, while traveling, or when you can't get to a gym.</p>
<h2>Warm-up</h2>

    <span style="color:#000000;">Lesson Podcast Discussion: Proper Warm-up Routine</span> <audio controls="">

<p>A proper warm-up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles. Try these exercises at your own pace:</p>
<p><br/><br />
Jumping jacks (about 30 seconds, or until you feel warm)<br />
Arm circles (about 15 seconds forward, 15 seconds backward)<br />
High knees in place (about 30 seconds, go at your own speed)<br />
Bodyweight squats (10 slow squats)<br />
Shoulder rolls (10 forward, 10 backward)</p>
<p><br/><br />
Warming up is important because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sends blood to your muscles</li>
<li>Increases muscle flexibility and helps prevent injuries</li>
<li>Prepares both your body and mind for exercise</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Create Your Own Circuit (15 minutes)</h2>
<p>Now it's time to design your own simple 4-exercise circuit using the bodyweight exercises you've practiced. </p>
<p><br/><br />
Your circuit should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include at least one exercise for upper body, lower body, and core</li>
<li>Have exercises performed for about 30 seconds each with 15-30 seconds rest between (adjust as needed)</li>
<li>Include at least one modification to make an exercise easier or harder based on your fitness level</li>
</ul>
<p>Take 5-7 minutes to plan your circuit. Write down your exercises and test them in your space. Make sure you have enough room to move safely.</p>
