# 3.4 Tracking and Reflecting on Your Cardio Circuit

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Fill out a cardio log to track your circuit workouts
- Create a SMART fitness goal for your cardio circuit practice
- Explain how your body feels during and after your cardio circuit

## Why It Matters
Now that you've created your own cardio circuit in our last lesson, keeping track of your workouts is the next important step! Your cardio log shows what exercises from your circuit make you feel great and which ones might need adjustments. These records help you make smarter choices about staying active and building healthy habits that stick. The skills you learn from tracking your exercise will be super helpful in other parts of your life too!

You'll need:

- A cardio log worksheet (you can print this from your course materials)
- A pencil or pen
- A timer or stopwatch (your phone timer works great too!)
- Comfy clothes you can move around in
- Your completed cardio circuit from Lesson 3.3

## Let's Begin!

### Step 1: Getting to Know Your Cardio Log 
Your cardio log is like a fitness diary where you'll write down:

- Which cardio circuit you completed (the one you designed in Lesson 3.3)
- How many rounds you completed
- How long you exercised (in minutes)
- How hard it felt (on a scale where 1=super easy and 5=really tough!)
- How your body and mind felt during and after (energized? tired? happy?)

Take a quick look at your cardio log worksheet. Can you find all the different boxes where you'll record this information? Check out the example in your materials to see what a filled-out log looks like.

## Cardio Log Information

Your cardio log helps you track:

- Which cardio circuit you completed  
- Number of rounds completed  
- Exercise duration (minutes)  
- Difficulty level (1-5 scale)  
- How your body and mind felt

## My Cardio Circuit Performance

| Date | Circuit Name | Rounds Completed | Total Time (min) | Difficulty (1-5) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

### Step 2: Time to Try Your Cardio Circuit! 
Remember the cardio circuit you created in our last lesson? Now it's time to put it into action! Get your circuit plan ready and follow these steps:

1. Start with the warm-up we learned (arm circles, knee hugs, torso twists, and slow jumping jacks)
2. Set your timer for the exercise and rest periods you planned
3. Complete your circuit following the structure you designed
4. Try to complete the number of rounds you planned in your circuit

While you're moving through your circuit, pay attention to how your body feels - notice your heartbeat getting faster, your breathing changing, and which muscles are working hard. Some activities in your circuit might feel easier for you than others - that's totally normal!

### Step 3: Write It Down
Right after you finish your circuit, grab your cardio log and fill it out while everything is fresh in your mind. Be honest about how the workout felt - this is just for you to learn about yourself, not to impress anyone!

### Step 4: Think About Your Circuit Workout
Now that you've finished, take a moment to think about your experience and answer these questions in your notebook:

## Workout Reflection

How did my body feel during different exercises?

---

Which activities were most enjoyable and why?

---

---

Which activities made me work hardest?

---

---

How do I feel after completing my circuit?

### Step 5: Create Your Own Fitness Goal 
Now that you've tried your cardio circuit, let's create a fitness goal just for you. A great goal follows the SMART format:

- **S**pecific: Exactly what you want to do with your cardio circuit
- **M**easurable: How you'll know when you've done it
- **A**chievable: Something you can actually do (be realistic!)
- **R**elevant: Something that matters to you
- **T**ime-bound: When you plan to finish it

For example: "I will complete my cardio circuit three times a week for the next two weeks, adding one extra round each week."

## My SMART Fitness Goal

**S**pecific: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**M**easurable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A**chievable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**R**elevant: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**T**ime-bound: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My complete SMART goal:

<br/>
Write your goal in your cardio log. If you can, tell a family member about your goal - sharing it with someone else makes it more likely you'll stick with it!

## Circuit Adjustments

What will I change about my circuit next time?

## Progress Tracking

| Date | Rounds | Time | How I Felt (1-5) | Notes for Improvement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

As we continue our fitness journey, we'll explore different muscle groups and how they work together when you exercise. The tracking skills you're learning now will connect with our upcoming lessons on strength and flexibility.
