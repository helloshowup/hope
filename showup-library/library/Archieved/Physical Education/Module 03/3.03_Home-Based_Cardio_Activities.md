## Create Your Own Cardio Circuit 

Now that you've learned these awesome cardio moves, it's time to put them together into your very own workout! Creating your own circuit is like being the DJ of your fitness routine â€“ you get to choose the moves that feel best for your body and that you enjoy the most. This is your chance to be creative and design something that's just right for you.

<br/>
Think about which exercises made you feel energized and which ones challenged you in a good way. Maybe you loved the rhythm of the invisible jump rope or felt strong doing mountain climbers. Your personal circuit should include your favorites, arranged in an order that keeps you motivated and having fun while you work up a sweat.

### Building Your Circuit
1. Select 3-4 exercises from the ones you've practiced
2. Set a time for each exercise (20-30 seconds works well for most people)
3. Plan short breaks (10-15 seconds) between activities
4. Give your workout a name that motivates you

<br/>
Take a few minutes to organize your circuit, then complete it 2-3 times with a 1-minute rest between rounds.

<br/>
As you gain confidence, try designing a second circuit with different exercises or combinations.

<br/>
Make it your own! Modify exercises to suit your style or create a theme for your workout. Maybe you'll create a "Morning Energy Boost" or "Stress Buster" circuit!
