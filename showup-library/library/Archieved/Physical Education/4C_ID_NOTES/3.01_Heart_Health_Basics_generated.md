# Lesson Number and Title: 3.1 Heart Health Basics: Understanding Your Cardiovascular System

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson introduces middle school students to the cardiovascular system, explaining how the heart functions normally and during exercise. It covers the benefits of cardiovascular exercise and includes a hands-on activity for students to measure their own heart rate.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Students engage in an authentic heart rate measurement activity where they check their pulse at rest, after exercise, and during recovery.
- **Supportive Information**: The lesson provides conceptual explanations of heart anatomy, how the heart functions during rest and exercise, and the benefits of cardiovascular exercise.
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions are provided for measuring pulse and calculating heart rate using the 15-second count method.
- **Part-task Practice**: The heart rate exploration activity focuses specifically on the skill of finding and measuring pulse in different states of activity.

## Assessment Direction:
- Students could complete a reflective journal documenting their heart rate measurements in various activities over several days
- A digital quiz could assess understanding of heart anatomy and function
- Students could create a personal cardiovascular exercise plan demonstrating their understanding of heart health principles
