# Lesson Analysis: 2.3 Movement Concepts

## 2.3.1 Understanding Personal and General Space

### Brief Content Overview
This lesson introduces students to personal and general space awareness through physical movements. Students create a "personal space bubble" and perform various shapes within it, then practice navigating through general space with specific movements.

### 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Creating personal space bubble, making shapes within personal space, navigating general space with specific movements
- **Supportive Information**: Conceptual understanding of personal vs. general space, real-world applications
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions for creating shapes and movement patterns
- **Part-task Practice**: Specific shape formations (tall, small, wide, twisted) and movement patterns (walking, tip-toe, side steps)

### Assessment Direction:
- Photo/video submission of students demonstrating different shapes
- Written reflection on real-world applications of personal/general space awareness
- Self-assessment checklist for movement completion without collisions

## 2.3.2 Direction Detective Activity

### Brief Content Overview
This lesson focuses on directional awareness and movement sequencing. Students follow a prescribed movement sequence, then create and practice their own sequence of movements.

### 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Following a specific movement sequence, creating an original movement sequence
- **Supportive Information**: Example sequence provided as a model
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions for the movement sequence
- **Part-task Practice**: Repetitive practice of movement sequences until mastery

### Assessment Direction:
- Written documentation of student-created movement sequence
- Video submission showing sequence performance
- Self-assessment of movement control and consistency

## 2.3.3 Exploring Movement Levels

### Brief Content Overview
This lesson teaches students about different movement levels (high, medium, low). Students create level indicators, move freely, then respond to randomly selected levels by creating appropriate movements.

### 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Creating and responding to level indicators, generating level-appropriate movements
- **Supportive Information**: Connection to sports applications at different levels
- **Procedural Information**: Timer-based activity structure, level-response protocol
- **Part-task Practice**: Creating and holding movements at specific levels

### Assessment Direction:
- Written reflection connecting movement levels to specific sports
- Photo collage showing student in positions at each level
- Movement log documenting which levels were used and what movements were created

## 2.3.4 Creating Basic Body Shapes

### Brief Content Overview
This lesson teaches four basic body shapes (wide, narrow, curved, twisted) and guides students to practice them individually and in sequences. Students create and practice a flowing sequence of three different shapes.

### 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Creating individual shapes, responding to timed prompts, developing a flowing sequence
- **Supportive Information**: Visual descriptions of each shape type
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions for creating each shape, timing protocol
- **Part-task Practice**: Holding each shape for 5 seconds, repeating shape sequence until mastery

### Assessment Direction:
- Drawing or written description of three-shape sequence
- Video submission of shape sequence performance
- Peer review opportunity using success criteria as evaluation guide
