## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Create a weekly fitness plan that works all parts of fitness
- Pick fun fitness activities that you'll want to keep doing
- Track your fitness progress in a journal

## Getting Started

Now that you've completed your fitness testing from our last lesson, it's time to create your own balanced fitness plan! A good fitness routine includes activities that work on all the components of fitness we tested.

### What Makes a Balanced Plan?

A balanced fitness plan should include activities that improve:

- Cardiovascular endurance (activities that make your heart beat faster)
- Muscular strength (exercises that make your muscles stronger)
- Muscular endurance (exercises that help your muscles work longer)
- Flexibility (stretches that help you bend and reach farther)
- Body composition (a mix of activities that help build muscle and burn calories)

## Fun Fitness Activities to Try

Here are some activities you might enjoy for each fitness component:

**Cardiovascular Endurance:**
- Walking or jogging around your neighborhood
- Riding your bike
- Dancing to your favorite songs
- Jump rope challenges
- Playing tag with friends or siblings

**Muscular Strength and Endurance:**
- Various body weight exercises (we'll learn specific ones in future lessons)
- Helping with household chores that require strength
- Carrying groceries or books
- Playground activities like climbing and hanging
- Using resistance bands (with adult supervision)

**Flexibility:**
- Gentle stretching activities (we'll cover specific stretches later)
- Reaching for your toes
- Arm circles
- Side bends
- Simple stretches that feel comfortable

**Fun Combination Activities:**
- Playing basketball, soccer, or other sports
- Swimming
- Obstacle courses in your backyard
- Fitness video games

## Creating Your Weekly Plan

Use the "My Weekly Fitness Plan" template to schedule your activities. Try to include:
- At least 3 days of cardiovascular activities
- 2-3 days of strength exercises
- Flexibility exercises most days
- Rest days when your body feels tired

Remember: Choose activities you actually enjoy! When exercise is fun, you'll stick with it and see better results.

## Tracking Your Progress

Now you can use the templates to keep track of how you're doing:

1. Fill out the "My Weekly Fitness Plan" chart each week
   - Write down what activities you did
   - How long you did them
   - How you felt (score 1-10)
   - Any notes about the activity

2. Use the "My Fitness Components Tracker" to:
   - List which activities you'll do for each fitness component
   - Set weekly and monthly goals for yourself

3. Complete the "Monthly Progress Check" to see your improvements:
   - Record your starting scores from the fitness tests
   - Retest yourself each month
   - Watch your numbers improve over time!
