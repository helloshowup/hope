# 1.6 Self-Assessment in Physical Education: Know Your Fitness Level

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson teaches students how to assess their own fitness levels using four simple tests that measure different aspects of physical fitness. Students learn to record their results and set improvement goals based on their personal baseline measurements.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Students perform authentic whole-task fitness assessments including modified push-up test, sit-and-reach test, one-minute sit-up test, and wall-sit endurance test.
- **Supportive Information**: The lesson provides context about individual differences in fitness levels, factors affecting starting points, and the importance of personal improvement rather than comparison.
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions are provided for each fitness test, including proper form, counting methods, and measurement techniques.
- **Part-task Practice**: Specific skills highlighted for practice include proper form for push-ups, sit-ups, stretching technique for flexibility, and correct positioning for wall-sits.

## Assessment Direction:
1. Performance-based assessment through the four fitness tests with quantitative measurements
2. Self-reflection through journal entries analyzing personal strengths and areas for improvement
3. Goal-setting assessment where students create specific, measurable fitness improvement targets

# Self-Assessment in Physical Education: Know Your Fitness Level
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:
- Test your own fitness level using four simple tests
- Record your fitness scores in a journal
- Set a clear goal to get better at one fitness skill

Ready to discover what your body can do? This lesson helps you measure your own fitness level using simple tests you can do at home or school. Understanding your starting point will help you set better fitness goals and track your progress. Remember, everyone begins somewhere different, and what really counts is your own improvement!

## Materials Needed
- Your PE clothes
- A fitness journal or notebook
- Stopwatch or timer (your teacher will provide this)
- Measuring tape
- Wall space
- Exercise mats

## Warm-Up (5-10 minutes)
Let's get our bodies ready! We'll do:
- Jumping jacks (30 seconds)
- Arm circles (15 forward, 15 backward)
- High knees (30 seconds)
- Light jogging in place (1 minute)

## Fitness Assessment Activities (30-40 minutes)

### Modified Push-Up Test
**What it measures:** Upper body strength and endurance

**How to do it:**
1. Get into a push-up position with your knees on the ground
2. Keep your back straight and hands slightly wider than your shoulders
3. Lower your chest until your elbows form 90-degree angles (like a right angle or corner)
4. Push back up to the starting position
5. Count how many you can do with good form in one minute

**Record in your journal:** Number of modified push-ups completed

### Sit-and-Reach Test
**What it measures:** Flexibility in your lower back and hamstrings (back of your thighs)

**How to do it:**
1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you
2. Place your feet flat against the wall or measuring box
3. Reach forward with both hands as far as you can without bending your knees
4. Hold the position for 2 seconds
5. Measure how far your fingertips reach (in centimetres or inches)

**Record in your journal:** Distance reached

### One-Minute Sit-Up Test
**What it measures:** Abdominal strength and endurance (how strong your stomach muscles are)

**How to do it:**
1. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor
2. Cross your arms over your chest or place hands behind your head
3. Curl up until your shoulders are off the mat
4. Return to the starting position
5. Count how many you can do in one minute

**Record in your journal:** Number of sit-ups completed

### Wall-Sit Endurance Test
**What it measures:** Leg strength and endurance

**How to do it:**
1. Stand with your back against a wall
2. Slide down until your knees are bent at 90 degrees (like sitting in an invisible chair)
3. Keep your back flat against the wall
4. Hold this position as long as you can
5. Time yourself until you can't hold it anymore

**Record in your journal:** Time (in seconds) you held the position

## Over to You (10-15 minutes)

Now that you've completed all four tests, let's think about what your results mean:

**Class Discussion:**
- How did you feel during each test?
- Which test was easiest for you? Which was most challenging?
- Did anything surprise you about your results?

**Understanding Your Starting Point:**
Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses in fitness. Some people might be naturally flexible but find push-ups difficult. Others might have strong legs but struggle with sit-ups. Your starting point depends on many factors like:
- Your previous experience with sports and exercise
- Your body type
- Your age and growth stage
- Activities you enjoy doing

**Setting Goals Based on Your Results:**
In your fitness journal, write down:
1. One fitness area where you feel strongest
2. One fitness area you'd like to improve
3. A specific, realistic goal for improvement (For example: "I want to increase my wall-sit time by 15 seconds over the next month")

## Wrap-Up and Cool-Down (5-10 minutes)
Let's cool down our bodies with some gentle stretches:
- Reach for the sky, then touch your toes (10 seconds each)
- Gentle arm stretches (hold each for 15 seconds)
- Butterfly stretch for your legs (30 seconds)
- Deep breathing (5 slow breaths)

Remember to bring your fitness journal to class regularly. We'll retest in a few weeks to see how much you've improved!

**Homework:** Try one of these fitness tests at home with a family member. Compare your results and encourage each other to improve!
