# Lesson Number and Title: My Fitness Components Tracker

## Brief Content Overview:
This document provides a tracking template for students to monitor their fitness components. It includes a table structure for students to record planned activities, weekly goals, and monthly goals across the five components of fitness.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: The tracker serves as a whole-task experience where students plan and monitor their complete fitness program across all components.
- **Supportive Information**: The document implicitly references the theoretical framework of the five fitness components and provides an example for cardiovascular endurance.
- **Procedural Information**: The table structure provides just-in-time guidance on how to organize fitness planning with examples.
- **Part-task Practice**: Each individual fitness component (cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, etc.) is highlighted for dedicated practice and tracking.

## Assessment Direction:
- Student completion of the tracker could serve as a formative assessment of understanding fitness components
- Progress toward stated goals could be documented through photos/videos as evidence
- Reflective writing about challenges and successes in meeting goals could provide summative assessment data
