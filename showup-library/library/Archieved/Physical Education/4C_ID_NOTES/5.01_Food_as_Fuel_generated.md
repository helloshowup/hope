# 5.1 Powering Your Body for Physical Activity

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson introduces middle school students to the three main nutrients that power physical activity: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Students learn to identify these nutrients in foods and understand how to time nutrition for optimal physical performance.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:

### Learning Tasks
- Food sorting activity where students categorize 10-15 kitchen items into carbohydrate, protein, and fat groups
- Self-reflection on personal eating habits and their impact on physical performance
- Implicit task of planning meals for before/after exercise based on nutrient timing principles

### Supportive Information
- Explanation of how carbohydrates provide quick energy for immediate activities
- Description of proteins as "construction workers" that repair and build muscles
- Characterization of fats as long-lasting energy sources for extended activities
- Visualization of the "Perfect Plate" model for balanced nutrition

### Procedural Information
- Step-by-step instructions for completing the food sorting activity
- Specific timing guidelines for when to eat different nutrients (2-3 hours before, 30-60 minutes before, after activity)
- Troubleshooting tips for the food sorting activity

### Part-task Practice
- Identifying the main nutrient in individual food items
- Categorizing foods based on their primary nutrient content
- Analyzing personal food choices from the previous day

## Assessment Direction
- Performance assessment: Accuracy of food categorization in the sorting activity
- Reflective assessment: Quality of student responses to the checkpoint question about personal eating habits
- Application assessment: Creation of a pre/post exercise meal plan incorporating appropriate nutrient timing
