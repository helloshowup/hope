# 6.1 The FITT Principle

## Lesson Number and Title: 6.1 The FITT Principle

## Brief Content Overview:
This lesson introduces middle school students to the FITT Principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type) as a framework for creating personalized exercise plans. Students learn how to apply each component of FITT through simple activities and self-assessment techniques.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:

### Learning Tasks:
- Creating a personal FITT plan based on individual goals
- Performing self-assessment of exercise intensity using talk test and effort scale
- Practicing different exercise types (cardio, strength, flexibility)
- Scheduling exercise sessions within personal weekly routines

### Supportive Information:
- Explanation of each FITT component with age-appropriate examples
- Analogies comparing FITT to familiar concepts (TV shows, volume knobs, movies)
- Guidelines for appropriate frequency, intensity, time and types of exercise for middle school students

### Procedural Information:
- Step-by-step instructions for performing the talk test
- Specific scale (1-10) for measuring exercise intensity
- Directions for timing exercise intervals (1 minute activity, 30 seconds rest)
- Instructions for basic exercises like wall push-ups

### Part-task Practice:
- Isolated practice of intensity measurement through 30-second exercise bursts
- Focused practice of each exercise type (cardio, strength, flexibility)
- Time management practice through timed exercise intervals

## Assessment Direction:
- Self-assessment checkpoints throughout the lesson allow students to reflect on their current habits and experiences
- Performance-based assessment could include students creating and documenting their own FITT plan
- Knowledge assessment could test understanding of each FITT component through scenario-based questions
