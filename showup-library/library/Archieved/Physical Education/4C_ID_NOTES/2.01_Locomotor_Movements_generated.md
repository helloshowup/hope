# Lesson Number and Title: 2.1 Fundamental Locomotor Movements: Building Blocks for Lifelong Fitness

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson introduces five basic locomotor movements (walking, running, hopping, jumping, and skipping) as foundational skills for physical activities. The content provides detailed technique instructions for each movement with accompanying audio guidance.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:

### Learning Tasks
- Practicing proper walking technique for at least 10 steps in a straight line
- Implementing running form in available spaces (yard, driveway, or in place)
- Performing hopping exercises 5 times on each foot
- Executing jumping technique in a clear area with focus on take-off and landing
- Practicing the step-hop pattern of skipping in available space

### Supportive Information
- Explanation of how locomotor movements serve as building blocks for sports and activities
- Description of how these movements transfer to games like tag or football
- Rationale for proper technique (improved control, confidence, efficiency)
- Context for how these skills apply to various sports and physical activities

### Procedural Information
- Step-by-step instructions for proper technique in each movement
- Specific body positioning guidance (e.g., "Stand tall with your head up and shoulders relaxed")
- Precise movement cues (e.g., "heel-to-toe" walking pattern)
- Audio instructions for each locomotor movement

### Part-task Practice
- Isolated practice of arm movements during running
- Focus on foot placement techniques for each movement
- Balance practice during hopping exercises
- Landing mechanics practice during jumping exercises

## Assessment Direction
- Self-assessment checkpoint asking students to identify locomotor movements used in their favorite sports
- Potential for video submission of students demonstrating each locomotor movement with proper form
- Possible movement analysis where students evaluate their own technique against provided criteria
