## Lesson Number and Title: 1.2 Test Your Fitness Superpowers!

## Brief Content Overview:
This lesson introduces students to the four components of physical fitness and provides simple self-assessment tests for each component. Students learn to measure their current abilities in cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks:** Students perform authentic whole-task experiences through four fitness self-assessments (jumping jacks, push-ups, wall sits, and sit-and-reach tests).
- **Supportive Information:** The lesson provides conceptual understanding of the four fitness components and explains how each test measures different physical abilities.
- **Procedural Information:** Step-by-step instructions are provided for each fitness test, including proper form and counting methods.
- **Part-task Practice:** Each specific fitness component (cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility) is isolated for dedicated practice and assessment.

## Assessment Direction:
- Self-assessment tracking where students record their initial scores and monitor improvements over time
- Peer assessment where students could partner virtually to verify proper form and count repetitions
- Reflective journal entries where students identify their natural strengths and areas for improvement based on test results

## Key Takeaways
- Physical fitness consists of four key components: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility, each measuring different abilities of your body.
- Simple tests like jumping jacks, push-ups, wall sits, and toe touches help you measure your current fitness levels and track improvements over time.
- Everyone has natural strengths in different fitness areas, but regular practice can improve all components regardless of your starting point.
