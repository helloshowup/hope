# 6.4 Overcoming Barriers to Physical Activity

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Name at least 3 common barriers to being active

- Create a plan to add more movement to your daily life

## Materials Needed

- Notebook or paper and pencil

We all face roadblocks when trying to stay active. Maybe homework piles up, rain ruins outdoor plans, or you just don't feel like moving. These challenges happen to everyone! Today, we'll look at common obstacles and discover practical ways to get past them.

<br/>
Spotting and solving these exercise problems is a skill you'll use your whole life. Now that we understand how to track our progress, let's focus on keeping active even when things don't go as planned.

## Common Barriers to Physical Activity 
Let's be honest - staying active isn't always easy! When I talk with students your age, they often mention running into the same problems over and over. These obstacles can pop up suddenly or slowly build until they become real roadblocks to staying active. By recognizing these common challenges, you'll be better prepared when they show up in your own life. Here are some typical obstacles that might keep you from being active:

<br/>
1. **Limited Time Due to Homework**: School, homework, and other activities can fill up your day quickly.

<br/>
2. **Lack of Equipment**: You might not have sports gear, gym access, or fitness equipment at home.

<br/>
3. **Limited Space**: A small bedroom or apartment can make it hard to find room to move.

<br/>
4. **Weather Restrictions**: Rain, extreme heat, or cold can make outdoor activities difficult.

<br/>
5. **Lack of Motivation**: Some days you just don't feel like moving - and that's okay!

## Overcoming Barriers: Practical Solutions
Now that you've identified what's getting in your way, it's time for the fun part - finding workarounds! Think of yourself as a problem-solver on a mission. The great thing about the solutions we're about to explore is that they're designed for real kids in real homes - not fancy gyms or perfect situations. You can mix and match these ideas or even come up with your own versions that work better for your specific challenges. Now let's tackle these challenges with specific solutions you can try at home:

### 1. For Limited Time:

**Quick Solutions:**
- **Time-Chunking Method**: Do three separate 5-minute activity breaks instead of one 15-minute session
  - Morning: 5 minutes of stretching after waking up
  - After school: 5 minutes of jumping jacks or high knees
  - Evening: 5 minutes of dancing to favorite songs

- **Homework Movement Breaks**: Set a timer to stand up and move for 2 minutes after every 20 minutes of homework
  
- **Multitasking Options**:
  - Do calf raises while brushing teeth
  - Practice balance exercises while waiting for microwave
  - Stretch arms and shoulders while watching videos

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If you forget your movement breaks, set alarms on your phone
- If you're too tired after school, try morning activity instead
- If homework takes too long, use the Pomodoro technique (20 min work/2 min movement)

### 2. For Lack of Equipment:
You don't need fancy gym equipment to get moving! In fact, your home is already filled with items that can double as fitness tools. Many professional athletes started out using everyday objects for training. The solutions below use simple things you probably already have around your house, making it easy to start right away without spending any money or waiting for special deliveries.

**Household Item Alternatives:**
- **Water Bottle Weights**: Fill water bottles for different weights
  - Small bottle (8 oz) = light weight
  - Large bottle (20 oz) = medium weight
  - Gallon jug with handle = heavy weight

- **DIY Step Platform**: Use a sturdy stair step or a thick hardcover book that doesn't slide

- **Makeshift Balance Beam**: Place a piece of tape on the floor in a straight line

- **No-Equipment Workout Circuit**: Complete 30 seconds of each:
  - Jumping jacks
  - Wall push-ups
  - Chair squats (squat to touch a chair seat, then stand)
  - Plank hold
  - Rest 1 minute, then repeat 2-3 times

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If water bottles leak, use canned food items instead
- If you don't have space for jumping jacks, try marching in place
- If a movement hurts, modify it to be smaller or slower

### 3. For Limited Space:
Living in a small space doesn't mean you can't be active! Remember that we covered this topic in detail in lesson 6.3. If you're struggling with limited space for movement, take a few minutes to review that lesson where we explored many creative ways to stay active in small areas. Those same strategies will help you overcome this barrier and keep moving, even when space is tight.

### 4. For Weather Restrictions:
Bad weather happens - rain pours down, snow piles up, or maybe it's just too hot to play outside. These weather challenges can quickly derail outdoor activity plans, but they don't have to stop you from moving altogether! With a little creativity, you can turn your indoor spaces into activity zones that keep you moving regardless of what's happening outside your window. Plus, these indoor options can be fun alternatives that add variety to your regular routine.

**Indoor Activity Options:**
- **Hallway Activities**: 
  - Hallway bowling with water bottles and soft ball
  - Hallway hopscotch with paper squares
  - Walking lunges from one end to the other

- **Room-Based Circuit**: Create stations in different parts of your home:
  - Bedroom: 10 sit-ups
  - Bathroom doorway: 10 doorway stretches
  - Living room: 10 couch step-ups
  - Kitchen: 10 counter push-ups

- **Rainy Day Movement Menu**: Choose 3-5 activities from this list:
  - Dance to 3 favorite songs
  - Follow a 10-minute online workout video
  - Do a cleaning sprint (set timer for 5 minutes of fast cleaning)
  - Create an indoor obstacle course
  - Do stair repeats (up and down) for 5 minutes

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If you're concerned about noise, use a yoga mat or towel to muffle footsteps
- If space is shared, schedule your activity time when others are busy
- If you get bored easily, change activities every 5 minutes

### 5. For Lack of Motivation:
We all have days when we just don't feel like moving - even adults who love exercise! Motivation comes and goes for everyone, which is totally normal. The trick isn't to always feel motivated (that's impossible), but to have strategies ready for those low-energy days. These simple motivation boosters can help you get moving even when your brain is saying "maybe tomorrow." Remember, starting is usually the hardest part - once you begin, continuing often becomes much easier!

**Motivation Boosters:**
- **5-Minute Rule**: Commit to just 5 minutes of activity - once started, you'll often continue longer
- **Activity Jar**: Write 15-20 quick activities on paper slips (10 jumping jacks, 30-second plank, etc.). When unmotivated, pull one slip and do just that activity
- **Reward System**: Create a chart with boxes to check off each time you complete an activity. After 5 checks, give yourself a small reward

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If you're feeling too tired, try a gentle stretching routine instead of skipping completely
- If you're bored with your usual activities, try something completely different
- If you keep forgetting, pair activity with something you already do daily (like brushing teeth)


## Getting Back on Track After a Break
Let's face it - even with the best plans, sometimes life gets in the way. You might miss a few days (or even weeks) of being active because of tests, family events, illness, or just forgetting. This happens to EVERYONE - even Olympic athletes have off periods! The difference between people who stay active long-term and those who don't isn't about never missing workouts - it's about how quickly they get back on track after a break. The good news is that restarting is a skill you can learn and practice.

Everyone misses activity sometimes. Here's your restart plan when that happens:

**The 3-Step Restart Method:**

1. **Reset Day**: Choose a specific day to restart. Write it down.
   
<br/>
2. **Minimum Viable Activity**: Select one 5-minute activity that feels easy and doable.
   
<br/>
3. **Barrier Review**: Look at what caused you to stop and pick one strategy to address it.

**Restart Activity Menu** (choose one for your first day back):
- 5 minutes of gentle stretching
- Walking up and down stairs 3 times
- Dancing to one favorite song
- 10 jumping jacks, 10 arm circles, 10 high knees

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about the last time you took a break from being active. What obstacle got in your way? How did you feel when you started moving again? What could make it easier to restart next time?
