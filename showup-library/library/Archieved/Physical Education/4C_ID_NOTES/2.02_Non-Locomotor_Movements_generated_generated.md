# Lesson Analysis: Non-Locomotor Movement Basics

## Lesson Number and Title: 
"Non-Locomotor Movement Basics"

## Brief Content Overview:
This document outlines six fundamental non-locomotor movements: bending, stretching, twisting, turning, pushing, and pulling. Each movement type includes 2-3 specific examples or variations for students to practice.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Students perform authentic whole-body movements within their personal space, practicing each non-locomotor movement pattern.
- **Supportive Information**: The document provides mental models for how each movement should look and feel (e.g., "pretend you're pushing a heavy object").
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions are provided for executing each movement correctly (e.g., "Stand tall, then bend forward at your waist").
- **Part-task Practice**: Each non-locomotor movement is broken down into specific variations for focused practice (e.g., different types of bends, stretches, etc.).

## Assessment Direction:
- Video submission of students demonstrating each non-locomotor movement
- Self-assessment checklist where students rate their execution of each movement
- Movement identification quiz where students identify movements from images or descriptions

# Lesson Analysis: Movement Freeze Game

## Lesson Number and Title:
"Movement Freeze Game"

## Brief Content Overview:
This document describes a self-directed activity where students play music, move freely, and then pause the music to practice freezing in different non-locomotor positions. Students are instructed to hold each position for 5-10 seconds.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Students engage in an authentic game-based experience combining music, movement, and self-directed practice.
- **Supportive Information**: The activity builds on previous knowledge of non-locomotor movements introduced in the first document.
- **Procedural Information**: Clear step-by-step instructions guide students through the game process.
- **Part-task Practice**: The freeze moments provide dedicated practice opportunities for holding and controlling each non-locomotor position.

## Assessment Direction:
- Student-recorded video showing 2-3 freeze moments during the game
- Reflective journal entry describing which positions were easiest/most challenging to hold
- Parent/guardian observation form noting student engagement and proper execution
