# Lesson Number and Title: 4.3 Flexibility Training

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson introduces flexibility training to middle school students, covering different stretching types, safety guidelines, and six specific stretches with detailed instructions. The content includes setup requirements and addresses common challenges students might face when stretching.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Students perform authentic whole-task stretching routines including shoulder rolls, neck stretches, hamstring stretches, quadriceps stretches, calf stretches, and side stretches.
- **Supportive Information**: The lesson provides theoretical frameworks about different types of stretching (static, dynamic, ballistic) and explains the importance of flexibility for injury prevention and movement quality.
- **Procedural Information**: Just-in-time information includes specific safety guidelines, proper body positioning for each stretch, and clear step-by-step instructions with success checks.
- **Part-task Practice**: The lesson highlights specific stretching techniques for dedicated practice, with each stretch focusing on different muscle groups (shoulders, neck, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, sides).

## Assessment Direction:
- Photo/video submission of students demonstrating 3-4 key stretches with proper form
- Reflective journal entries documenting students' stretching routines and perceived improvements over time
- Self-assessment checklist where students evaluate their technique against the "success check" criteria for each stretch
