# Lesson Number and Title: Adapting Traditional Games for Indoor Play

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson teaches students how to modify outdoor games for indoor play by adjusting space requirements, equipment, and rules. It provides specific examples of adapted games and emphasizes safety considerations for indoor physical activity.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Students learn to adapt outdoor games for indoor spaces by modifying three key elements (space, equipment, rules) and are asked to create their own safe indoor game with simple rules.
- **Supportive Information**: The document provides principles of game modification, explains benefits of indoor adaptations, and offers examples of transformed games with clear rationales.
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions are provided for setting up and playing specific adapted games (Mini-Basketball, Hallway Bowling, Sock Volleyball).
- **Part-task Practice**: The lesson highlights specific skills developed through each game adaptation, such as shooting accuracy, rolling accuracy, and hand-eye coordination.

## Assessment Direction:
1. Performance-based assessment where students demonstrate their adapted indoor game and explain modifications made
2. Reflective journal entry documenting the process of adapting a favorite outdoor game and analyzing effectiveness
3. Self-assessment tracking sheet where students record progress in skill development across multiple practice sessions

Key Takeaways: Indoor games can be created by modifying three key elements: reducing the space requirements, using softer household items as equipment, and adjusting rules to fit indoor limitations.
