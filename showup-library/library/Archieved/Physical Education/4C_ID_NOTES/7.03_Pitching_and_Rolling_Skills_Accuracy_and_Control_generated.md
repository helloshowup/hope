# Lesson Number and Title: 7.3 Pitching and Rolling Skills: Accuracy and Control

## Brief Content Overview
This lesson teaches middle school students how to throw and roll objects with proper form and accuracy. It provides step-by-step instructions for rolling and underhand pitching techniques, along with three practice activities that progressively build skill in target accuracy.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Target Challenge, Accuracy Game, and Knock-Down Challenge provide authentic whole-task experiences where students apply pitching and rolling skills in progressively difficult scenarios.
- **Supportive Information**: Explanations of why rolling and pitching techniques are important in various sports and everyday situations, plus comparisons to familiar activities (aiming a remote-controlled car, carnival games).
- **Procedural Information**: Step-by-step instructions for proper rolling technique (7 steps) and underhand pitching technique (7 steps), plus troubleshooting guidance for common problems.
- **Part-task Practice**: Grip testing activity isolates the grip component of throwing; object testing activity focuses specifically on how different objects affect rolling outcomes.

## Assessment Direction:
- Performance-based assessment tracking improvement in accuracy scores across different distances and techniques
- Self-assessment through progress tracking charts where students record scores and compare rolling versus pitching effectiveness
- Practical skills demonstration where students must successfully complete challenges at specified proficiency levels before advancing to greater distances
