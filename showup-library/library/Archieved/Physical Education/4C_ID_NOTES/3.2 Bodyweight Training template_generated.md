# Lesson Number and Title: Bodyweight Training: Create Your Own Circuit

## Brief Content Overview
This document guides students through creating a personalized bodyweight circuit workout. It includes sections for exercise selection, circuit structure planning, proper form guidelines, workout space considerations, and post-workout reflection.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: Creating a complete bodyweight circuit workout from selection through execution and reflection represents an authentic whole-task experience.
- **Supportive Information**: Form checklists for push-ups, squats, planks, and lunges provide mental models for proper exercise execution.
- **Procedural Information**: The circuit structure table offers just-in-time information for organizing workout components (duration, rest periods, modifications).
- **Part-task Practice**: Specific form elements for each exercise are highlighted for dedicated practice (e.g., hand position in push-ups, knee tracking in squats).

## Assessment Direction:
1. Performance-based assessment of proper exercise form through video submission or synchronous demonstration
2. Written workout plan evaluation based on appropriate exercise selection and structure
3. Self-assessment through the reflection component to demonstrate understanding of personal fitness needs and workout effectiveness
