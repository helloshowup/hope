## Brief Content Overview:
This lesson introduces students to non-locomotor movements - physical actions performed while staying in one place. The content covers six types of non-locomotor movements, explains their importance, and guides students through practicing and combining these movements.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:

### Learning Tasks:
- "Movement Freeze" activity where students practice all six non-locomotor movements with music
- Creating and performing movement sequences combining multiple non-locomotor movements
- Self-assessment checklist to evaluate personal movement mastery

### Supportive Information:
- Definition and explanation of non-locomotor movements
- Comparison table between locomotor and non-locomotor movements
- Explanation of why these movements matter for physical development
- Examples of each movement type with descriptions

### Procedural Information:
- Step-by-step instructions for performing each non-locomotor movement
- Audio instructions for the Movement Freeze game
- Detailed breakdown of a basic movement sequence (8 steps)

### Part-task Practice:
- Individual practice of specific movements (bending, stretching, twisting, turning, pushing, pulling)
- Holding freeze positions for 5-10 seconds
- Practicing movement sequences at different speeds (slow, medium, fast)

## Assessment Direction:
- Self-assessment rating scale (1-5) for mastery of each movement type
- Performance-based assessment where students create and demonstrate their own movement sequence
- Checkpoint reflections comparing locomotor and non-locomotor movements from daily life
