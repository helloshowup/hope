# Lesson 1.2.1 My Fitness Tracker

## Brief Content Overview
This document provides a personal fitness tracking tool for students to record their performance across four fitness components. It includes tables for logging test results, feelings, and future goals for cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility.

## 4C/ID Component Analysis:
- **Learning Tasks**: The tracker serves as an authentic whole-task experience where students monitor their own fitness progress over time.
- **Supportive Information**: The document implicitly references the theoretical framework of fitness components (cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility).
- **Procedural Information**: Just-in-time information is provided through clear instructions for each fitness test (e.g., "How many jumping jacks in 1 minute?").
- **Part-task Practice**: Specific skills highlighted for dedicated practice include jumping jacks, push-ups, wall sits, and the sit-and-reach test.

## Assessment Direction:
1. Formative self-assessment through repeated testing and goal-setting
2. Progress tracking through comparison of initial and subsequent test results
3. Reflective assessment through the "How I Felt" documentation after each test
