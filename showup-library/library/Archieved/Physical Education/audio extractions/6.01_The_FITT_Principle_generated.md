## What is the FITT Principle?

Have you ever wondered how athletes and fitness coaches plan their workouts? They don't just make things up as they go! Most of them use something called the FITT Principle. FITT is like a recipe for exercise that helps you get the results you want. Just like you need the right ingredients to bake cookies, you need the right mix of exercise components to reach your fitness goals.

The letters in FITT stand for Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type. Think of these as the building blocks of any good workout plan. When you understand these four parts, you can create your own exercise routine that's perfect for YOU - not just copying what someone else does. In this lesson, we'll explore each part of FITT and show you how to build your very own fitness plan!

1. **Find a clear area**: You'll need a space about the size of a bathroom rug where you can move freely without bumping into furniture
2. **Equipment alternatives**:

- No weights? Use filled water bottles or canned food
- No exercise mat? Use a folded blanket or towel
- No jump rope? Pretend to hold one and jump in place

3. **Safety check**:

- Make sure your floor isn't slippery
- Remove any objects you might trip over
- Have water nearby
- Wear comfortable clothes and supportive shoes

## Exploring Each Part of FITT

### Frequency

Let's talk about frequency first - it's probably the easiest part of FITT to understand! Frequency is just a fancy word for "how often" you do something. Think about your favorite TV show - maybe you watch it once a week when a new episode comes out. That's the frequency of your TV watching! With exercise, frequency means how many days each week you get your body moving. Finding the right frequency is like solving a puzzle - too little exercise and you won't see results, but too much without rest can make you tired or even injured.

Frequency is simply how many days per week you exercise. For students your age:

- Aim for at least 3-5 days of activity each week
- Rest days are important too - your body needs time to recover
- You don't have to do the same thing every day
- Spreading different activities throughout the week keeps things interesting

**Activity**: Look at your weekly schedule and mark specific days and times when you can exercise. For example:
- Monday: 4:00-4:30 PM
- Wednesday: 3:30-4:00 PM
- Saturday: 10:00-10:30 AM

### Intensity

Have you ever noticed how some activities make your heart pound and leave you breathing hard, while others barely make you break a sweat? That difference is what we call intensity! Intensity is like the volume knob on your exercise - you can turn it up when you want a bigger challenge or turn it down when you need something easier. The cool thing about intensity is that YOU control it based on how you're feeling that day. Some days you might have tons of energy for high-intensity exercise, while other days you might need something gentler. Learning to measure your own intensity is an important skill that even professional athletes use!

Intensity means how hard your body is working. Here are two ways to measure it on your own:

- **Talk Test**: 
  1. During activity, try to say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing a verse of your favorite song
  2. If you can talk comfortably = low intensity
  3. If you can talk but not sing = medium intensity
  4. If you can barely talk = high intensity

- **Scale of Effort**: 
  1. During activity, rate your effort from 1-10
  2. 1-3 = easy (like walking slowly)
  3. 4-6 = medium (breathing harder but can continue)
  4. 7-10 = hard (breathing very hard, can't continue long)

**Activity**: Try these three exercises for 30 seconds each:
1. Walking in place
2. Jogging in place
3. Jumping jacks

<br/>
After each one, immediately write down:

- Your effort score (1-10)
- Whether you could talk easily, with difficulty, or barely at all

### Time

Time is all about how long your exercise sessions last. Think of time like a movie - some are short (like a 30-minute TV show), and others are longer (like a 2-hour superhero movie). Both can be great, but they feel different! The same goes for exercise. A quick 10-minute workout might be perfect when you're busy with homework, while a longer 45-minute session might be fun on the weekend. The good news is that even short bursts of activity count toward your daily total. So if you can't find a big chunk of time, don't worry - you can break it up into smaller, bite-sized pieces throughout your day!

Time refers to how long each exercise session lasts. For your age group:

- Try for about 30-60 minutes of activity per day
- This doesn't have to be all at once! Breaking it up works too (like 10 minutes in the morning, 10 at lunch, and 10 after school)

**Activity**: Use a timer (phone, clock, or kitchen timer) for these practice sessions:
1. Do any movement (march in place, dance, etc.) for 1 minute
2. Rest for 30 seconds
3. Repeat 3 times

<br/>
How did it feel? Was it too short, too long, or just right? Write this down in your fitness journal.

### Type

Type is all about WHAT kind of exercise you choose to do. It's like picking what to watch on TV - sometimes you want an action movie, sometimes a comedy, and other times a documentary. Your body benefits from different types of movement just like your brain enjoys different types of shows! The three main exercise types - cardio, strength, and flexibility - each help your body in different ways. Mixing them up keeps exercise fun and gives you more complete fitness. The best part is that you get to pick activities you actually enjoy - because the best exercise plan is one that you'll actually want to do!

Type is the kind of exercise you choose. There are three main types:

<br/>
1. **Cardio**: Activities that get your heart pumping

- Examples you can do at home: Jogging in place, jumping jacks, dancing to music, climbing stairs

2. **Strength**: Activities that build muscle

- Examples with no equipment: Push-ups against a wall, squats, lunges, plank position

3. **Flexibility**: Activities that stretch your muscles

- Examples: Reaching for your toes, arm circles, gentle twists

**Activity**: Try one exercise from each category:
1. Cardio: March in place for 30 seconds
2. Strength: Do 5 wall push-ups (standing arms-length from wall, push against it)
3. Flexibility: Reach arms overhead and gently lean side to side

<br/>
After each one, write down:

- How it felt in your body
- Which one you enjoyed most
- Which one was most challenging

## Creating Your Own FITT Plan

Now it's time to create your own FITT plan with these specific steps:

<br/>
1. **Set a measurable goal**: Complete this sentence: "In 4 weeks, I want to be able to ___________."
   Examples:

- Run in place for 5 minutes without stopping
- Do 10 push-ups in a row
- Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight

2. **Fill in your FITT plan worksheet**:

   | Component | My Plan | Why I Chose This |
   |-----------|---------|------------------|
   | Frequency | ___ days per week | |
   | Intensity | ___ out of 10 | |
   | Time | ___ minutes per session | |
   | Type | List specific activities: | |

<br/>
3. **Create a weekly schedule**: Write down exactly when you'll exercise each day:

   | Day | Time | Activity | Location in Home |
   |-----|------|----------|------------------|
   | Monday | | | |
   | Tuesday | | | |
   | Wednesday | | | |
   | Thursday | | | |
   | Friday | | | |
   | Saturday | | | |
   | Sunday | | | |

<br/>
4. **Progress tracking**: After each workout, record:

- Date and time
- What you did
- How long you did it
- How it felt (1-10 scale)
- One thing you're proud of
- One thing to improve next time

## Sample FITT Plans for Students

  - Thursday: Interval training (30 seconds hard, 30 seconds easy) - Intensity 8/10
  - Friday: Flexibility (stretching routine) - Intensity 4/10

## Troubleshooting Your FITT Plan

Here are solutions for common challenges you might face:

**If you don't have enough space:**
- Focus on stationary exercises (planks, push-ups, squats)
- Use a chair for step-ups instead of running
- Try "traveling" exercises in a small path (2-3 steps forward and back)

**If you don't have equipment:**
- Books in a backpack = weights
- A towel = resistance band (pull it tight between hands)
- Stairs = cardio machine
- Chair = workout bench

**If you're not sure you're doing exercises correctly:**
1. Take a photo or video of yourself
2. Compare to example images provided
3. Check these key points:

- Back straight, not rounded
- Knees aligned with toes, not caving inward
- Movements controlled, not rushed

## Adjusting Your FITT Plan

After following your plan for one week, use this self-assessment checklist:

- [ ] I completed all my planned workout sessions
- [ ] The intensity level felt appropriate (challenging but doable)
- [ ] I had enough energy to complete each session
- [ ] I enjoyed at least some of the activities
- [ ] I'm seeing or feeling small improvements

Based on your answers, here's how to adjust:

**If it feels too easy** (you checked all boxes and felt you could do more):
1. Keep frequency the same
2. Increase just ONE of these:

- Intensity: Add 1-2 points to your target effort level
- Time: Add 5 minutes to your sessions
- Type: Try the more challenging version of an exercise (regular push-ups instead of wall push-ups)

**If it feels too hard** (you couldn't check most boxes):
1. Keep frequency the same
2. Decrease just ONE of these:

- Intensity: Lower your target effort by 2-3 points
- Time: Reduce sessions by 5-10 minutes
- Type: Try the easier version of exercises (wall push-ups instead of regular)

**If you get bored:**
1. Keep your schedule and timing the same
2. Swap activities for similar ones:

- Instead of jogging in place, try dancing
- Instead of regular push-ups, try them with hands in different positions
- Add music to your workout

**Success indicators** - You'll know your plan is working when:
- You can complete all sessions without excessive fatigue
- Your breathing recovers faster after exercise
- Movements that were once hard become easier
- You look forward to (at least some) exercise sessions
- You can do more repetitions or time than when you started

Remember, the FITT Principle gives you the power to create your own personalized fitness plan. By understanding and adjusting the Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of your workouts, you can design an exercise routine that fits your schedule, matches your interests, and helps you reach your goals. Fitness isn't about being perfect - it's about discovering what your amazing body can do!

## Key Takeaways

- The FITT Principle helps you create your own exercise plan using four parts: Frequency (how often), Intensity (how hard), Time (how long), and Type (what kind of exercise).
- A good fitness plan includes all three types of exercise: cardio for your heart, strength for your muscles, and flexibility for stretching.
- You can adjust your FITT plan if it feels too easy, too hard, or boring by changing just one part at a time while tracking your progress.
