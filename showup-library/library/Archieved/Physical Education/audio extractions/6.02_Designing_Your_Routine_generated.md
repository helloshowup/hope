Getting active doesn't require complicated plans or boring exercises! This lesson shows you how to build a weekly fitness routine that works with your schedule and feels good. You'll discover ways to combine different activities into a plan that keeps you motivated to move.

## Setting Up Your Home Fitness Space

Finding the right spot in your home to exercise makes a big difference in how much you'll enjoy working out. You don't need a huge space - just a small area where you can move freely without bumping into furniture or worrying about breaking things. Many students find that moving a coffee table or pushing a bed to one side creates enough room for most activities.

Before creating your routine, set up a dedicated space for exercise:

**Basic Setup Requirements:**
- Clear a space at least 6 feet by 6 feet (enough to lie down with arms extended)
- Remove any breakable items or tripping hazards
- Have a water bottle nearby for hydration
- Use a towel or yoga mat for floor exercises if available (a folded blanket works too)

**Troubleshooting Common Space Issues:**
- Limited space? Focus on stationary exercises and clear just enough room to stand with arms extended
- Noisy environment? Use headphones for workout videos or create a visual exercise chart
- Shared space? Schedule your workout time when fewer people are around or create a portable workout kit in a box

## Setting Realistic Weekly Goals

When you're just starting out with fitness, it's easy to get super excited and plan to exercise every single day for an hour. But that's kind of like deciding to read an entire book in one night - it's too much at once! Instead, think about what you can actually do with your current schedule and energy level. Maybe that's just 15 minutes three times a week to begin with, and that's perfectly okay. The most important thing is to start with something you can definitely accomplish.

Let's create some concrete goals to help you succeed:

<br/>
1. Fill in this specific goal template in your notebook:
   "By the end of this month, I want to be able to _____ (specific physical achievement)."
   Examples:

- Walk continuously for 15 minutes
- Do 10 proper push-ups (or 10 modified push-ups on knees)
- Touch my toes while keeping my legs straight

2. Look at your actual schedule and mark exactly when you have 15-30 minute blocks available for exercise. Count how many blocks you have each week.

<br/>
3. Write down 3 physical activities you genuinely enjoy or are curious to try.

<br/>
Starting with smaller goals and building up gives you much better results than trying to do too much at once!

## Balancing Different Types of Activities

Think of your weekly exercise plan like making a sandwich - you need different ingredients to make it taste good and give you energy. Just doing one type of exercise, like only push-ups every day, would be like eating a sandwich with just bread! Your body works best when you give it different types of movement throughout the week. This variety helps all parts of your body get stronger while keeping exercise fun and interesting.

Your fitness routine needs different types of movement, just like your body needs various foods. Include:

**Cardio Days (2-3 times weekly):** Activities that speed up your heart and breathing:
- Walking or jogging around your neighbourhood
- Marching or jogging in place (perfect for small spaces)
- Dancing to music you love
- Jumping jacks or jump rope (use an imaginary rope if you don't have one)

**How to know you're doing cardio right:** You should be breathing harder than normal but still able to speak in short sentences. If you can sing easily, increase intensity; if you can't talk at all, decrease intensity.

**Strength Days (2 times weekly):** Exercises that build muscle:
- Bodyweight moves like push-ups, squats, and lunges
- Household item weights:
  - Filled water bottles (16-20 oz) for light weights
  - Backpack with books for heavier weights
  - Canned goods for small hand weights

**Beginner strength circuit (repeat 2-3 times):**
1. 10 wall push-ups (standing at arm's length from wall)
2. 10 chair squats (lower until you almost touch a chair seat)
3. 10 standing calf raises
4. 30-second rest

**Flexibility/Recovery Days (1-2 times weekly):** Helping your body stretch and recover:
- Basic stretching routine (hold each stretch for 30 seconds):
  - Reach for toes (hamstring stretch)
  - Arm across chest (shoulder stretch)
  - Gentle neck tilts (side to side)
  - Calf stretch against wall
- Simple yoga poses: child's pose, downward dog, gentle twists

**Fun Activity Days (1-2 times weekly):** Things you actually look forward to:
- Solo sports practice (shooting baskets, kicking soccer ball against wall)
- Follow-along dance videos
- Exploring your neighborhood on foot or bike
- Active video games

## Activity Selection Exercise

Now it's time to put your plan into action! The chart below will help you organize your thoughts and create a fitness routine that works for you. Think about when you have free time during the week - maybe after school before dinner, or on weekend mornings. Also consider what you enjoy doing and what equipment you already have at home. Remember, the best exercise plan is one that you'll actually follow because it fits into your life and includes activities you like.

Complete this chart in your notebook:

## Sample Weekly Schedules for Beginners

Looking at a blank schedule can sometimes feel overwhelming - where do you even start? That's why we've created some sample weekly plans to give you ideas. These examples show how to spread different types of activities throughout the week, with rest days mixed in. You might follow one of these exactly, or use them as inspiration to create your own unique plan that fits your schedule and interests.

Here's what a week might look like if you're just starting out:

**Beginner Schedule:**
- Monday: 20-minute walk around your home or neighbourhood (cardio)
- Tuesday: 15 minutes of basic exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and squats (strength)
- Wednesday: Rest day or light stretching
- Thursday: 20-minute bike ride or marching in place at home (cardio)
- Friday: 15 minutes of yoga or stretching (flexibility)
- Saturday: Practice basketball skills or another sport by yourself for 30 minutes (fun activity)
- Sunday: Rest day

**Success Indicators:** You've successfully completed this beginner schedule if:
- You completed at least 4 of the 5 active days
- You were able to finish each session without excessive fatigue
- Your breathing returned to normal within 5 minutes after cardio activities
- You felt some muscle challenge during strength exercises but could complete all repetitions

As you get stronger and build more stamina, you might want to try this:

**Intermediate Schedule:**
- Monday: 30-minute jog or fast walk (cardio)
- Tuesday: 20 minutes of strength exercises with resistance bands or household items (strength)
- Wednesday: 20 minutes of yoga following an online video (flexibility)
- Thursday: 30 minutes of dancing to your favorite music or cycling (cardio)
- Friday: Rest day
- Saturday: 45 minutes practicing sports skills or playing an active game (fun activity)
- Sunday: 15 minutes of stretching (recovery)

## Creating Workouts with Available Resources

You don't need to wait until you have "real" exercise equipment to get started with fitness. In fact, your home is already filled with items that can double as workout gear! Using everyday objects for exercise is not only budget-friendly but also teaches you to be creative with what you have. Many professional athletes started out using makeshift equipment - like filling milk jugs with water for weights or using stairs for cardio training.

No fancy equipment needed! Here's what works with items you already have:

**At Home:**
- Water bottle weights: Fill bottles with water for 1-2 pound weights (add sand for more)
- Chair exercises: Use a sturdy chair for modified squats, tricep dips, and step-ups
- Towel resistance: Pull against a folded towel for resistance training
- Stair workouts: Walk up and down stairs for 5 minutes (or step up and down on a single sturdy step)

**In Your Yard or Nearby:**
- Wall push-ups: Use an exterior wall for modified push-ups
- Curb or step exercises: Use for calf raises and step-ups
- Natural movements: Practice balancing on logs, stepping over obstacles
- Distance markers: Use trees, poles or signs to mark walking/running intervals

**Indoor Alternatives for Bad Weather:**
- Indoor circuit: 30 seconds each of marching in place, squats, push-ups, and jumping jacks
- Commercial break challenge: Do one exercise during each TV commercial
- Room-to-room workout: Assign different exercises to different rooms and rotate
- Hallway shuttle: Jog or shuffle quickly from one end to the other 10 times

## Troubleshooting Common Exercise Challenges

Even with the best plans, you'll probably run into some roadblocks along the way. That's totally normal! Everyone faces challenges with exercise - even Olympic athletes have days when they don't feel like working out or when things don't go as planned. The key is to have some strategies ready for when these situations come up, so you can adjust your plan instead of giving up completely.

- **If you feel pain (not just muscle fatigue):** Stop immediately, rest, and try a modified version next time
- **If you get bored:** Create a workout playlist with your favorite upbeat songs or exercise during a TV show
- **If you're too tired:** Try exercising at a different time of day or reduce the intensity but maintain frequency
- **If you forget to exercise:** Set a daily alarm on your phone or link exercise to another daily habit (like before dinner)

## Keeping Exercise Interesting with Variety

Have you ever had a favorite food that you ate so often you got tired of it? The same thing can happen with exercise! Doing the exact same workout day after day gets boring for both your brain and your body. Your muscles actually adapt to repeated movements, which means you'll stop seeing improvements after a while. Plus, your mind craves new challenges and experiences. Adding variety to your routine keeps things fresh and exciting, making it much more likely that you'll stick with exercise for the long run.

The same workout day after day gets boring quickly. Here are ways to mix things up:

- Try one new activity each month
- Create milestone challenges: Track your progress toward specific achievements like 10 push-ups or a 1-minute plank
- Change your environment: Rotate between different areas in/around your home
- Create themed workout days: "Music Monday" with favorite songs, "Challenge Tuesday" with new exercises
- Track progress: Keep a simple chart showing which days you exercised and one improvement you noticed

## Weekly Fitness Plan Creation

Now comes the fun part - creating your very own personalized fitness plan! This is where you get to take everything you've learned and design a weekly schedule that fits your life, your interests, and your goals. Remember that this plan isn't set in stone - it's more like a first draft that you can adjust as you learn what works best for you. The most important thing is to be realistic about what you can actually do right now, not what you wish you could do or what someone else is doing.

## Self-Reflection After One Week
After following your plan for one week, answer these questions:
1. Which activities did I enjoy most and why?
2. Which activities were challenging but doable?
3. Which activities need modification to work better?
4. What is one physical improvement I've noticed?
5. What is one adjustment I'll make to my plan next week?

<br/>
A balanced weekly fitness routine combines activities you enjoy with a regular schedule that works for you. Everyone's fitness journey looks different, and adjusting your plan as you go is completely normal. The most important parts are staying consistent and having fun while being active! By mixing different types of exercise throughout your week and using what you have available, you'll build healthy habits that can last for years.
