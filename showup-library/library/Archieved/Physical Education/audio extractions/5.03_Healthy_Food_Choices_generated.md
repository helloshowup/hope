# 5.3 Fuelling Your Body for Physical Activity

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Show how the MyPlate model helps you eat a mix of good foods
- Pick snacks that give you energy before you play or work out
- Choose foods that help your body feel better after being active

## Materials Needed

- Two similar snack items with nutrition labels (or access to online images of nutrition labels)
- Paper and pencil or digital note-taking app
- Drawing supplies (pencil, markers, or crayons)

Your body works hard during physical activity. The foods you eat before playing basketball, running in PE class, or riding bikes with friends affect both how well you perform and how you feel afterward. Eating the right foods at the right times gives you energy to play longer, helps build stronger muscles, and speeds up how quickly you recover.

## The MyPlate Model

Have you ever wondered what a perfectly balanced meal looks like? The MyPlate model gives us a simple picture to follow. Think of it as a food map that shows you how to fill your plate at each meal. The colorful design divides your plate into sections - kind of like pizza slices - showing how much space each food group should take up. This isn't just something adults made up - it's based on what scientists have learned about keeping our bodies healthy and strong, especially when we're active and growing.

Let's look at what goes on your plate:

- **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and berries provide quick energy and important vitamins
- **Vegetables**: Carrots, broccoli, and spinach contain minerals and vitamins that keep your body working properly
- **Grains**: Bread, pasta, and rice fuel your activities with long-lasting energy (brown and whole grain versions work best)
- **Protein**: Chicken, beans, eggs, and nuts help repair and build your muscles
- **Dairy**: Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain calcium that strengthens your bones

When you include foods from each group in your meals, your body gets all the nutrients it needs to stay healthy and active.

## Pre-Workout Snacks
Eating a small snack 30-60 minutes before you exercise gives your body fuel to perform well. Try these pre-workout snacks:

Think of your body like a car that needs gas before a long trip. Without fuel in the tank, you might run out of energy halfway through your game or workout. But not all snacks work the same way! Some give you a quick burst of energy that disappears fast (like eating candy), while others provide steady energy that lasts through your whole activity. The best pre-workout snacks combine both quick and long-lasting energy sources, without being so big that they make your stomach feel heavy when you move around.

- **Banana with peanut butter**: Bananas provide quick energy while peanut butter adds protein that helps that energy last
- **Apple slices with cheese**: The fruit gives immediate energy while cheese adds staying power
- **Yogurt with berries**: This combination digests easily and provides both quick and sustained energy
- **Whole grain crackers or toast**: These complex carbohydrates release energy steadily during your activity

Keep your pre-workout snack small - just enough to fuel you without feeling heavy in your stomach. If you eat too much right before exercise, you might feel uncomfortable or get a stomach ache.

## Post-Workout Refuelling
Your body needs specific nutrients after exercise to recover properly. Eating within 30 minutes after finishing activity helps your muscles rebuild stronger. 

After you finish playing sports or exercising, your body is kind of like a construction site. All that running, jumping, and moving creates tiny tears in your muscles (don't worry - this is normal!). Your body needs the right building materials to repair these tears, which actually makes your muscles stronger than before. That's why what you eat after exercise matters so much.

The 30-minute window right after activity is super important - scientists call it the "recovery window" because your body is extra good at absorbing nutrients during this time. It's like your muscles have special doors that open wide right after exercise, making it easier for good nutrients to get inside and help with repairs.

Good recovery foods include:

- **Chocolate milk**: This tasty drink contains an excellent ratio of carbohydrates to protein that helps muscles recover
- **Turkey or chicken wrap**: The lean meat repairs muscle tissue while the wrap replenishes energy stores
- **Smoothie with yogurt and fruit**: Blending these ingredients creates an easy-to-digest mix of proteins and carbs
- **Hummus with veggies and pita bread**: This Middle Eastern combo provides plant protein and energy-restoring carbohydrates

Drink plenty of water after sweating! Replacing lost fluids helps your body recover faster and prevents dehydration, which can cause headaches and tiredness.

## Reading Food Labels

Have you ever picked up a food package and wondered what all those numbers and percentages really mean? Food labels are like secret codes that tell you exactly what's inside your snacks and meals. Learning to crack this code is a super useful skill - almost like having X-ray vision at the grocery store! Instead of just trusting what the front of the package says ("Super Healthy!" or "Energy Boost!"), the nutrition label on the back tells the real story.

Many foods that seem healthy might actually be packed with added sugars or unhealthy fats. For example, some granola bars have almost as much sugar as a candy bar! By knowing how to read labels, you can compare similar foods and make better choices for your active body.

Understanding food labels is a key skill that helps you make smarter food choices. Food labels reveal what's actually in the products you buy. Pay attention to:

- **Serving size**: The amount the nutrition facts are based on (often smaller than you might expect)
- **Calories**: How much energy the food provides your body
- **Protein**: Higher protein foods support muscle repair
- **Carbohydrates**: These provide energy - look for whole grains rather than refined ones
- **Sugars**: Check how much comes from added sugars versus natural sources
- **Ingredients list**: Foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients are usually less processed

## Food Label Comparison Activity

### Setup Instructions:
1. Find two similar snack items in your kitchen (examples: two granola bars, two types of crackers, or two breakfast cereals)
2. Place them side by side on a table with good lighting
3. Have a piece of paper and pencil ready, or use a digital note-taking app
4. If you don't have similar snacks available, use online images of nutrition labels (search "nutrition label granola bar" for examples)

### Activity Steps:
1. Create a simple comparison chart with these categories:

- Product name
- Serving size
- Calories per serving
- Protein amount
- Carbohydrate amount
- Sugar amount
- Number of ingredients

2. Fill in your chart with information from both food labels

<br/>
3. Answer these specific questions:

- Which snack has more protein per serving?
- Which has fewer added sugars?
- Which has more recognizable ingredients?
- Which would provide quicker energy? Which would provide longer-lasting energy?

### Success Criteria:
You've successfully completed this activity when you have:

- Filled in all categories in your comparison chart
- Answered all four analysis questions
- Identified which snack would work better before exercise and which would be better after exercise, with at least two specific reasons for each choice

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- If you can't find the added sugar amount, look at the ingredients list - ingredients are listed by quantity, so if sugar appears early in the list, there's likely more of it
- If you don't have food items available, ask a family member to describe labels to you or use online resources
- If you're unsure about an ingredient, look it up online to learn what it is

## MyPlate Tracking Activity

### Setup Instructions:
1. Get a piece of paper and drawing supplies (pencil, markers, or crayons)
2. Set up a quiet space where you can think about your meals from today or yesterday
3. Draw a large circle on your paper to represent a plate
4. Divide your circle into four sections, with a small circle beside it (like the MyPlate model)

### Activity Steps:
1. For each meal you ate today (or yesterday):

- Draw a new plate diagram
- Label the sections: Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, and Protein, with Dairy beside the plate
- Color in how much of each food group you actually ate (for example, if half your breakfast was eggs, color in half the protein section)

2. After completing all your meal plates, answer these reflection questions:

- Which food group did you eat the most of throughout the day?
- Which food group might you need to include more of tomorrow?
- Name one specific change you could make to better balance your plate at a particular meal

### Success Criteria:
You've successfully completed this activity when you have:

- Created plate diagrams for at least three meals
- Accurately represented the proportions of food groups in each meal
- Answered all three reflection questions
- Identified at least one specific, realistic change to improve your meal balance

### Example of a Completed Plate:
Breakfast Plate:

- Protein section (1/4 filled): Scrambled eggs
- Grains section (1/2 filled): Toast
- Fruits section (1/4 filled): Banana slices
- Vegetables section (empty)
- Dairy circle (1/2 filled): Glass of milk

Now that you understand these nutrition concepts, you can see how the foods you choose before and after being active directly affect your energy levels, strength, and recovery. Using the MyPlate model as a guide, selecting appropriate snacks for before and after exercise, and understanding food labels helps you make better choices. When you fuel your body properly, you'll have more stamina, build stronger muscles, and bounce back faster from all your physical activities!
