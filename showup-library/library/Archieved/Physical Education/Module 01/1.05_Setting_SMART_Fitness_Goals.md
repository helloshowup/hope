## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Explain what each letter in SMART goals means
- Create your own SMART fitness goal
- Tell why SMART goals work better than vague goals


Ever wanted to get better at a sport but weren't sure where to start? SMART goals are your secret weapon for turning fitness wishes into actual plans you can follow. They're a brilliant way to take charge of your health and fitness journeyâ€”and they work for all sorts of activities you enjoy!


## What Are SMART Fitness Goals?

When we talk about fitness goals, it's easy to say things like "I want to get in shape" or "I want to be better at sports." But these big ideas don't give us a clear path forward. That's where SMART goals come in! They break down our dreams into steps we can actually follow.


Think of SMART goals like a map. Without specific directions, you might wander around forever. But with clear instructions about where to go and how to recognize when you've found what you're looking for, you have a much better chance of success. Let's look at what each letter in SMART actually means for your fitness journey.


**S - Specific**: Your goal should clearly state exactly what you want to do.
*Instead of: "I want to get better at running."*
*Try: "I want to run a full mile without stopping."*

**M - Measurable**: Your goal needs a way to track your progress.
*Instead of: "I want to get stronger."*
*Try: "I want to do 15 push-ups in a row."*

**A - Achievable**: Your goal should be challenging but possible for you right now.
*Instead of: "I'll do 100 sit-ups tomorrow."*
*Try: "I'll work up to doing 25 sit-ups by practising a little more each week."*

**R - Relevant**: Your goal should matter to YOU and connect to activities you enjoy.
*Instead of: "I should join the swim team because my friend did."*
*Try: "I want to improve my basketball skills because I love playing with my friends."*

**T - Time-bound**: Your goal needs a deadline to help you stay on track.
*Instead of: "Someday I'll be more flexible."*
*Try: "I will be able to touch my toes by the end of this month."*

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you wanted to get better at something - maybe a video game, a hobby, or a school subject. Did you have a clear plan, or was your goal fuzzy? How might using the SMART method have helped you reach your goal faster or more easily?

## Examples of SMART Fitness Goals for Middle Schoolers

Looking at examples can really help us understand how to create our own goals. The great thing about SMART goals is that they can be customized for anyone - whether you're just starting to get active or you've been playing sports for years. Everyone's starting point is different, and that's perfectly okay!

Some students might want to make the basketball team, others wanted to run faster, and some just wanted to feel more comfortable. No matter what the goal was, using the SMART format helps everyone create a plan that made sense for them. Here are some examples that might inspire your own goal-setting:

- "I will run a mile without stopping by the end of this term."
- "I will do 10 proper push-ups in a row by winter break."
- "I will stretch for 10 minutes after school three days a week for the next month."
- "I will try a new physical activity (like skating or hiking) twice this month."
- "I will drink at least 6 cups of water every day this week."

## Creating Your Own SMART Fitness Goals
Now it's your turn! Follow these steps to create your own SMART fitness goal:

1. Think about what physical activities you enjoy and what you'd like to improve.
2. Choose one specific thing you want to accomplish.
