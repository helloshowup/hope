# 2.3 Body Awareness and Spatial Concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Show the four basic body shapes with good form
- Move at high, medium, and low levels with control
- Tell the key parts of space and how to use them safely

Knowing how our bodies move and relate to the space around us is a key part of physical education. These skills help you move safely and effectively, giving you the building blocks needed for sports, games, and everyday movement. 

<br/>
Let's build on what we learned about non-locomotor movements as we prepare for upcoming balance and coordination activities.

## Home Setup Instructions
Finding the right space for movement activities can be tricky at home, but with a little creativity, you can make almost any area work. Take a few minutes to scout out a good spot in your home - maybe it's a corner of your living room, a section of your bedroom with the rug rolled back, or even a hallway. The important thing is having enough room to move safely without bumping into furniture or walls.

<br/>
Before starting this lesson, you'll need:

- An open area approximately 6x6 feet (minimum)
- 3 pieces of paper and a marker for making signs
- A timer or stopwatch (phone timer works great)
- Optional: Music player
- Comfortable clothes that allow movement

If space is limited:

- Focus on stationary movements and smaller steps
- Use a hallway for directional movements
- Clear a small area of furniture temporarily

## Personal vs. General Space
Think about the last time you were in a crowded place - maybe the school cafeteria or a busy store. Remember how you had to be careful not to bump into others? That's spatial awareness in action! Understanding the difference between your personal space and the general space around you is something we use every day, often without even realizing it. This concept becomes especially important during physical activities when our bodies are in motion.\

<br/>
Here's the difference: 

**Personal space**: The area around your body that moves with you - about arm's length in all directions

**General space**: The shared area you move through - like the open space in your home

1. Stand in the middle of your open area
2. Create your "personal space bubble" by extending your arms fully in all directions
3. Make these specific shapes within your bubble:

- Tall shape: Reach up high with both arms
- Small shape: Crouch down with arms wrapped around knees
- Wide shape: Arms and legs stretched out like a star
- Twisted shape: Feet forward, upper body turned to one side

4. Move through your general space using these movements:

- 10 careful walking steps
- 5 tip-toe steps
- 8 side steps

5. After completing these movements, take a moment to think about:

- One time when you need personal space awareness at home (like moving around family members in the kitchen)
- One time when you need general space awareness outside (like navigating through a crowded hallway)

**Troubleshooting**: If you bump into objects, make your movements smaller or rearrange your space. Success looks like completing all movements without collisions.

## Directional Movements 
Just like a GPS gives you directions to navigate to new places, your brain needs to understand directional concepts to guide your body's movements. Think about playing your favorite sport or video game - you're constantly making split-second decisions about which way to move! These directional skills develop through practice and help you respond quickly in games and daily activities. Let's break down the basic directions and practice moving our bodies with purpose and control.

**Forward/backward**: Moving toward/away from where you're facing

**Sideways**: Moving to your right or left side

**Up/down**: Moving toward the ceiling or floor

1. Mark a starting point on the floor with a sock or piece of paper
2. Complete this exact movement sequence:

- 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward
- 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left
- Reach up high 3 times, crouch down low 3 times
3. Create your own sequence with 6-8 movements and write it down
4. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row
5. Self-check: Did you maintain control throughout all movements? Could you repeat your sequence exactly the same way multiple times?

**Example sequence**: 2 steps forward, 1 step left, reach up twice, 3 steps backward, crouch down, 2 steps right

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you had to navigate through a crowded space (like a busy hallway or store). How did you use your awareness of personal and general space to move safely without bumping into others?

## Levels of Movement 
When you watch athletes or dancers perform, you might notice how they use different heights in their movements. Basketball players jump high for rebounds, then crouch low to dribble. Dancers might leap into the air one moment and roll across the floor the next. These changes in level add variety and purpose to movement, making activities more interesting and effective. Understanding levels helps you become more versatile in how you move your body.

<br/>
As we continue our exploration, let's look at the three main levels of movement:

**High level**: Movements that reach toward the ceiling (jumping, reaching up)

**Medium level**: Movements at waist or chest height (walking, arm circles)

**Low level**: Movements close to the floor (crawling, crouching)

### Activity: "Level Shifters"

1. Make three signs labeled "high," "medium," and "low" and place them where you can see them
2. Set your timer for 20 seconds
3. Move freely during the countdown
4. When the timer beeps, look at one of your level cards (your choice)
5. Create and hold a movement or shape at that level for 5 seconds
6. Repeat this process 6 times, trying to use each level at least twice
7. After completing all rounds, take a moment to think about:

- One sport that uses high level movements (example: volleyball - jumping to spike)
- One sport that uses medium level movements (example: basketball - dribbling)
- One sport that uses low level movements (example: bowling - lunging low)

**Adaptation for limited space**: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements.

## Body Shapes 
Your body is amazingly flexible and can create all kinds of shapes! If you've ever watched gymnastics during the Olympics, you've seen athletes make their bodies into incredible forms while flipping through the air or balancing on equipment. Even if you're not a gymnast, understanding basic body shapes helps you move more effectively in any physical activity. These shapes are like the building blocks that combine to create more complex movements in sports, dance, and everyday activities.

<br/>
Let's discover the four basic body shapes that form the foundation of many movements:

**Wide**: Stretching out to take up more space (star jump)

**Narrow**: Making yourself thin or skinny (pencil position)

**Curved**: Creating rounded shapes with your body (ball shape)

**Twisted**: Rotating parts of your body in different directions (twist at waist)

### Activity: "Shape Shifter"

1. Practice each shape individually, holding for 5 seconds:

- Wide: Stand with legs apart and arms stretched out to sides
- Narrow: Stand tall with feet together, arms straight at sides
- Curved: Make a C-shape with your body, either standing or on the floor
- Twisted: Keep hips facing forward, turn upper body to right or left

2. Set your timer for 15 seconds
3. Move freely until the timer beeps, then freeze in one of the shapes
4. Repeat 8 times, trying each shape at least twice
5. Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together
6. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row
7. Draw your three-shape sequence on paper or describe it in writing

**Success criteria**: You should be able to clearly demonstrate each shape with proper form and hold it steady for at least 5 seconds.

## Putting It All Together: Spatial Awareness Challenge 
Now comes the fun part - combining everything you've learned into one creative challenge! This is similar to how musicians learn individual notes before playing a complete song, or how you might practice specific moves in a video game before tackling a difficult level. By putting these movement concepts together, you'll see how they work as a system rather than separate skills. This challenge will help you develop body control and movement fluency that transfers to sports, dance, and other physical activities.

<br/>
Let's combine everything you've learned with this final activity:

<br/>
1. Create a movement card set by writing these 8 challenges on separate pieces of paper (or use the pdf):

- "Make a wide shape at a high level"
- "Move backward at a low level"
- "Create a twisted shape in your personal space"
- "Travel sideways through general space at a medium level"
- "Make a narrow shape while moving forward"
- "Create a curved shape at a low level"
- "Move in a high level with a twisted shape"
- "Travel in a zigzag pattern at medium level"

2. Shuffle the cards and place them face down
3. Draw one card at a time and perform the movement
4. After each movement, rate yourself:

- Green: I did this movement correctly and confidently
- Yellow: I did this movement but need more practice
- Red: I found this movement difficult

5. Choose one "yellow" movement to practice 3 more times until it improves

**Adaptation**: If any movements are too difficult, modify them to match your ability level. For example, if balance is challenging, you can hold onto a chair for support.

---keytakeaways---
## Key Takeaways

- Your body moves through both personal space (the bubble around you) and general space (the area you travel through), which helps you move safely without collisions in physical activities.
- Movement can happen at three different levels (high, medium, low) and in four basic body shapes (wide, narrow, curved, twisted) that form the building blocks for sports and dance.
- Directional awareness (forward/backward, sideways, up/down) allows you to follow and create movement sequences that improve coordination and spatial intelligence.
