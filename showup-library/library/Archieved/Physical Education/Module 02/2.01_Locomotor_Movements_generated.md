**How to walk with good technique:**

- Stand tall with your head up and shoulders relaxed
- Start by placing your heel on the ground first, then roll to your toes (heel-to-toe)
- Keep your arms bent at about 90 degrees, swinging them naturally opposite to your legs
- Take steps that feel comfortable - not too big or too small
- Look ahead, not down at your feet
   
Find a clear space in your home where you can walk in a straight line for at least 10 steps. Try walking with good technique and notice how it feels when you pay attention to your posture and movement.

Script title: Effective Running Form

**How to run with good technique:**

- Keep your upper body straight but slightly leaned forward
- Lift your knees higher than when walking
- Land on the middle or front part of your foot, not your heel
- Bend your arms at about 90 degrees and pump them forward and back (not side to side)
- Keep your hands relaxed - imagine holding a potato chip without crushing it
- Breathe naturally through both your nose and mouth

If you have space in your yard, driveway, or a nearby park, practice running with good form for short distances. Even running in place in your room can help you practice proper form. Focus on your arm movement and foot placement.

**How to hop correctly:**

- Start standing on one foot with your knee slightly bent
- Swing your arms forward as you push off the ground
- Keep your eyes focused on one spot to help with balance
- Land softly on the ball of the same foot you jumped from, bending your knee to absorb the impact
- Use your arms to help keep your balance
- Practice on both your right and left foot - most people find one side easier than the other!

Find a spot in your home with enough space to hop safely. Try hopping in place 5 times on each foot. Notice which foot feels more comfortable to hop on and which one might need more practice.

Script title: Proper Jumping Technique
File name: 2-1-4.mp3
Content to be covered:

**How to jump effectively:**

- Start with your feet shoulder-width apart
- Bend your knees and hips like you're sitting in a chair
- Swing your arms backward, then forward and upward as you jump
- Push off with both feet at the same time
- While in the air, keep your body straight and look forward
- Land softly on the balls of your feet with your knees bent to absorb the shock
- End with your arms forward for balance

Remember: the deeper you bend before jumping, the higher you can usually jump!

Choose a clear area in your home where you can jump safely without hitting anything. Practice jumping in place, focusing on your take-off and landing technique. If you have outdoor space, you can try jumping for distance or height.

Script title: Learning to Skip
File name: 2-1-5.mp3
Content to be covered:

**How to skip:**

- Step forward with one foot
- Hop on that same foot while lifting your other knee up
- Then step forward with the other foot and hop on it
- Continue this step-hop pattern, alternating feet
- Use your arms naturally - they should swing in opposition to your legs
- Try to create a steady rhythm: step-hop, step-hop
- Keep your head up and maintain good posture

Find a space where you can move forward for at least a few steps. Practice the skipping pattern slowly at first, then try to create a smooth rhythm. If indoor space is limited, you can practice the step-hop motion in place to get the coordination down.
