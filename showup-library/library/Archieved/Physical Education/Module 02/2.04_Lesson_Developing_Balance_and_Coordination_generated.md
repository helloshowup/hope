- **One-Leg Stand Challenge**: 
  - Setup: Find a clear space with nothing to bump into. Stand near a wall or sturdy furniture that you can touch if needed for safety.
  - Activity: Stand on one leg with your arms out to the sides. 
  - Measurement: Count how many seconds you can hold the position before needing to put your foot down.
  - Progress markers: 5 seconds (beginner), 15 seconds (intermediate), 30 seconds (advanced)
  - Modifications: For an easier version, keep your lifted foot touching your ankle. For a harder challenge, close your eyes or stand on a folded towel to create an unstable surface.
