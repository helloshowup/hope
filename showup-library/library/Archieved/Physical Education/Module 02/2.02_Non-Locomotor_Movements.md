# 2.2 Your Body in Motion While Staying in Place

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Name 6 types of non-locomotor movements
- Show how to do each movement safely
- Create a short sequence using 4 different movements

### Understanding Non-Locomotor Movements

**What are they?**

Non-locomotor movements are physical actions you can do while staying in one spot. Think about how a tree sways in the wind without moving from its roots - that's similar to how your body can move in many ways without traveling anywhere. These movements are the building blocks for many physical activities and help you gain better control of your body.

**Common examples include:**

- Bending: Folding your body at joints like knees, waist, or elbows
- Stretching: Extending your limbs to create length in your muscles
- Twisting: Rotating your upper body while keeping your lower body still
- Turning: Pivoting on your feet to face different directions
- Pushing: Using force to move away from your body
- Pulling: Using force to bring something toward your body

**Why they matter:**

- These movements build the foundation for sports, dance, and everyday activities
- They help develop your muscle control and coordination
- They improve your balance and body awareness
- They prepare your body for more complex movements

### Locomotor vs. Non-Locomotor Movements
Have you ever noticed how different it feels to walk across a room compared to reaching up to a high shelf? These are two different types of movement patterns your body can perform. When we talk about movement in physical education, we often split them into two main categories that help us understand how our bodies work in different situations.

**Quick comparison:**
| Locomotor Movements | Non-Locomotor Movements |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Take you from place to place | Performed while staying in one spot |
| Examples: walking, running, skipping | Examples: bending, stretching, twisting |
| Focus on traveling | Focus on body control |

**CHECKPOINT:** Think of 3 locomotor movements you did today (like walking to your computer). Now think of 3 non-locomotor movements you've done (like reaching for something or turning to look at something).

### Exploring Each Movement

Let's take a closer look at each non-locomotor movement. As you read about each one, try to picture yourself doing the movement. You might even want to stand up and try some of these movements right now! Each one uses different muscles and gives you a different feeling in your body.

**Bending:**

- Stand tall, then bend forward at your waist, trying to touch your toes
- Bend your knees into a half-squat position
- Bend your elbows to touch your shoulders

**Stretching:**

- Reach your arms up high as if trying to touch the ceiling
- Extend your arms out to the sides like a star
- Stretch one arm across your chest

**Twisting:**

- Keep your feet planted and twist your upper body to look behind you
- Try twisting to both left and right sides
- Keep your hips facing forward as you twist

**Turning:**

- Pivot on one foot to face a different direction
- Try quarter turns, half turns, and full turns
- Keep your balance as you turn

**Pushing:**

- Pretend you're pushing a heavy object away from you
- Feel how your arm and shoulder muscles engage
- Try pushing with one arm, then both arms

**Pulling:**

- Imagine pulling a rope in a tug-of-war
- Feel your arm and back muscles working
- Try different pulling positions (high, middle, low)

### Activity : Movement Freeze
Now that you understand the different types of non-locomotor movements, it's time to put them into practice! The following activitY IS designed for you to do on your own, in whatever space you have available. You don't need any special equipment - just your body and enough room to move your arms without hitting anything.

---audioinstructionsEND---

- Choose a song you enjoy on your device
- Move freely within your personal space (a small area in your room)
- Pause the music yourself whenever you're ready
- When the music stops, freeze in one of the non-locomotor positions
- Hold each position for as long as comfortable (aim for 5-10 seconds)
- Continue until you've practiced all six movements

### Creating Movement Sequences

Once you've practiced individual movements, you can start putting them together like pieces of a puzzle. Movement sequences are like creating your own dance or exercise routine. By connecting different movements, you'll improve your coordination and make smoother transitions from one position to another. This is a skill that athletes, dancers, and even everyday movers use all the time!

**Basic Sequence:**
1. Start standing tall
2. Bend forward to touch your toes
3. Slowly stretch back up with arms reaching high
4. Twist to the right
5. Return to center
6. Twist to the left
7. Return to center
8. Turn in a full circle

---stopandreflect---
**CHECKPOINT:** Design a sequence using at least 4 different non-locomotor movements. Practice until you can perform it smoothly. Try performing your sequence at different speeds (slow, medium, fast).

## SELF-ASSESSMENT:

Now that you've learned about and practiced non-locomotor movements, it's time to check in with yourself. How well do you think you can perform each movement? This self-assessment will help you recognize your strengths and identify areas where you might want more practice. Remember, everyone has movements that come more naturally to them than others!

**Movement Mastery Checklist:**
Rate yourself on each movement from 1-5 (1=needs practice, 5=excellent):

- Bending: _____
- Stretching: _____
- Twisting: _____
- Turning: _____
- Pushing: _____
- Pulling: _____
