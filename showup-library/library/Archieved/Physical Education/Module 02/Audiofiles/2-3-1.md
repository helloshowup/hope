Script title: Understanding Personal and General Space
File name: 2-3-1.mp3
Content to be covered:
1. Stand in the middle of your open area
2. Create your "personal space bubble" by extending your arms fully in all directions
3. Make these specific shapes within your bubble:

   - Tall shape: Reach up high with both arms
   - Small shape: Crouch down with arms wrapped around knees
   - Wide shape: Arms and legs stretched out like a star
   - Twisted shape: Feet forward, upper body turned to one side

4. Move through your general space using these movements:

   - 10 careful walking steps
   - 5 tip-toe steps
   - 8 side steps

5. After completing these movements, take a moment to think about:

   - One time when you need personal space awareness at home (like moving around family members in the kitchen)
   - One time when you need general space awareness outside (like navigating through a crowded hallway)

**Troubleshooting**: If you bump into objects, make your movements smaller or rearrange your space. Success looks like completing all movements without collisions.
