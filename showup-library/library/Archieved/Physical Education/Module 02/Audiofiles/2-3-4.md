1. Practice each shape individually, holding for 5 seconds:

   - Wide: Stand with legs apart and arms stretched out to sides
   - Narrow: Stand tall with feet together, arms straight at sides
   - Curved: Make a C-shape with your body, either standing or on the floor
   - Twisted: Keep hips facing forward, turn upper body to right or left
2. Set your timer for 15 seconds
3. Move freely until the timer beeps, then freeze in one of the shapes
4. Repeat 8 times, trying each shape at least twice
5. Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together
6. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row
7. Draw your three-shape sequence on paper or describe it in writing

**Success criteria**: You should be able to clearly demonstrate each shape with proper form and hold it steady for at least 5 seconds.
