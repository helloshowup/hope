**How to hop correctly:**

- Start standing on one foot with your knee slightly bent
- Swing your arms forward as you push off the ground
- Keep your eyes focused on one spot to help with balance
- Land softly on the ball of the same foot you jumped from, bending your knee to absorb the impact
- Use your arms to help keep your balance
- Practice on both your right and left foot - most people find one side easier than the other!

Find a spot in your home with enough space to hop safely. Try hopping in place 5 times on each foot. Notice which foot feels more comfortable to hop on and which one might need more practice.
