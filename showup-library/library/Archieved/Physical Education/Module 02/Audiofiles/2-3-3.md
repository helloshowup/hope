Script title: Exploring Movement Levels
File name: 2-3-3.mp3
Content to be covered:
1. Make three signs labeled "high," "medium," and "low" and place them where you can see them
2. Set your timer for 20 seconds
3. Move freely during the countdown
4. When the timer beeps, look at one of your level cards (your choice)
5. Create and hold a movement or shape at that level for 5 seconds
6. Repeat this process 6 times, trying to use each level at least twice
7. After completing all rounds, take a moment to think about:

   - One sport that uses high level movements (example: volleyball - jumping to spike)
   - One sport that uses medium level movements (example: basketball - dribbling)
   - One sport that uses low level movements (example: bowling - lunging low)

**Adaptation for limited space**: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements.
