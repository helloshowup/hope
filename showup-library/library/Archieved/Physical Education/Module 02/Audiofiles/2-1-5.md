**How to skip:**

- Step forward with one foot
- Hop on that same foot while lifting your other knee up
- Then step forward with the other foot and hop on it
- Continue this step-hop pattern, alternating feet
- Use your arms naturally - they should swing in opposition to your legs
- Try to create a steady rhythm: step-hop, step-hop
- Keep your head up and maintain good posture

Find a space where you can move forward for at least a few steps. Practice the skipping pattern slowly at first, then try to create a smooth rhythm. If indoor space is limited, you can practice the step-hop motion in place to get the coordination down.
