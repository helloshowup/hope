**How to jump effectively:**

- Start with your feet shoulder-width apart
- Bend your knees and hips like you're sitting in a chair
- Swing your arms backward, then forward and upward as you jump
- Push off with both feet at the same time
- While in the air, keep your body straight and look forward
- Land softly on the balls of your feet with your knees bent to absorb the shock
- End with your arms forward for balance

Remember: the deeper you bend before jumping, the higher you can usually jump!

Choose a clear area in your home where you can jump safely without hitting anything. Practice jumping in place, focusing on your take-off and landing technique. If you have outdoor space, you can try jumping for distance or height.
