**How to walk with good technique:**

- Stand tall with your head up and shoulders relaxed
- Start by placing your heel on the ground first, then roll to your toes (heel-to-toe)
- Keep your arms bent at about 90 degrees, swinging them naturally opposite to your legs
- Take steps that feel comfortable - not too big or too small
- Look ahead, not down at your feet
   
Find a clear space in your home where you can walk in a straight line for at least 10 steps. Try walking with good technique and notice how it feels when you pay attention to your posture and movement.
