Content to be covered:
- **Statue Poses**: 
  - Setup: Clear a space where you can see your shadow on the floor or wall, or use a mirror if available.
  - Activity: Create three different balanced poses and hold each one. Examples include: standing with one foot on your opposite knee (tree pose), standing on tiptoes with arms overhead, or balancing in a "T" position with one leg extended behind you.
  - Measurement: Hold each pose for 10 seconds without wobbling.
  - Troubleshooting: If you keep falling over, try simpler poses or position yourself near a wall for occasional support.
