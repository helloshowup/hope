**How to run with good technique:**

- Keep your upper body straight but slightly leaned forward
- Lift your knees higher than when walking
- Land on the middle or front part of your foot, not your heel
- Bend your arms at about 90 degrees and pump them forward and back (not side to side)
- Keep your hands relaxed - imagine holding a potato chip without crushing it
- Breathe naturally through both your nose and mouth

If you have space in your yard, driveway, or a nearby park, practice running with good form for short distances. Even running in place in your room can help you practice proper form. Focus on your arm movement and foot placement.
