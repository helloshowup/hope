Script title: Understanding Personal and General Space
File name: 2-3-1.mp3
Content to be covered:
1. Stand in the middle of your open area
2. Create your "personal space bubble" by extending your arms fully in all directions
3. Make these specific shapes within your bubble:

   - Tall shape: Reach up high with both arms
   - Small shape: Crouch down with arms wrapped around knees
   - Wide shape: Arms and legs stretched out like a star
   - Twisted shape: Feet forward, upper body turned to one side

4. Move through your general space using these movements:

   - 10 careful walking steps
   - 5 tip-toe steps
   - 8 side steps

5. After completing these movements, take a moment to think about:

   - One time when you need personal space awareness at home (like moving around family members in the kitchen)
   - One time when you need general space awareness outside (like navigating through a crowded hallway)

**Troubleshooting**: If you bump into objects, make your movements smaller or rearrange your space. Success looks like completing all movements without collisions.

Script title: Direction Detective Activity
File name: 2-3-2.mp3
Content to be covered:
1. Mark a starting point on the floor with a sock or piece of paper
2. Complete this exact movement sequence:

   - 3 steps forward, 2 steps backward
   - 4 side steps right, 4 side steps left
   - Reach up high 3 times, crouch down low 3 times
3. Create your own sequence with 6-8 movements and write it down
4. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row
5. Self-check: Did you maintain control throughout all movements? Could you repeat your sequence exactly the same way multiple times?

**Example sequence**: 2 steps forward, 1 step left, reach up twice, 3 steps backward, crouch down, 2 steps right

Script title: Exploring Movement Levels
File name: 2-3-3.mp3
Content to be covered:
1. Make three signs labeled "high," "medium," and "low" and place them where you can see them
2. Set your timer for 20 seconds
3. Move freely during the countdown
4. When the timer beeps, look at one of your level cards (your choice)
5. Create and hold a movement or shape at that level for 5 seconds
6. Repeat this process 6 times, trying to use each level at least twice
7. After completing all rounds, take a moment to think about:

   - One sport that uses high level movements (example: volleyball - jumping to spike)
   - One sport that uses medium level movements (example: basketball - dribbling)
   - One sport that uses low level movements (example: bowling - lunging low)

**Adaptation for limited space**: Focus on stationary movements at each level rather than traveling movements.

Script title: Creating Basic Body Shapes
File name: 2-3-4.mp3
Content to be covered:
1. Practice each shape individually, holding for 5 seconds:

   - Wide: Stand with legs apart and arms stretched out to sides
   - Narrow: Stand tall with feet together, arms straight at sides
   - Curved: Make a C-shape with your body, either standing or on the floor
   - Twisted: Keep hips facing forward, turn upper body to right or left
2. Set your timer for 15 seconds
3. Move freely until the timer beeps, then freeze in one of the shapes
4. Repeat 8 times, trying each shape at least twice
5. Create a sequence of three different shapes that flow together
6. Practice your sequence until you can perform it smoothly 3 times in a row
7. Draw your three-shape sequence on paper or describe it in writing

**Success criteria**: You should be able to clearly demonstrate each shape with proper form and hold it steady for at least 5 seconds.
