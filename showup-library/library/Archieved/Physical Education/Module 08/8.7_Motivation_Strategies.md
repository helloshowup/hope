# 8.7 Staying Motivated to Be Active

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- List the two types of workout drive and tell which lasts longer
- Show how to build and keep up good workout habits
- Create a simple plan to track your own active time

## Materials Needed

- Piece of paper for Motivation Discovery activity
- Sheet of paper for Motivation Sorting activity
- Paper for Weekly Exercise Plan
- Paper or calendar for creating your Progress Tracker (Activity Calendar, Achievement Tracker, or Mood Monitor)
- Water bottle
- Optional: Mat, towel, or carpet for floor exercises
- Optional: Household items for exercise alternatives (soup cans, water bottles, tape, etc.)

Regular physical activity helps you feel good, stay healthy and have more energy. When you find activities you truly enjoy, you're building healthy habits that can stick with you for years to come.

## Understanding Your Motivation

### Activity: Motivation Discovery
1. On a piece of paper, write down 3 physical activities you've enjoyed in the past
2. For each activity, write one word that describes how you felt during the activity
3. Circle the activity that made you feel the best

<br/>
This helps you identify activities you're naturally drawn to, which makes staying active easier!

## Two Types of Motivation

There are two main ways we get motivated to be active:

**Internal Motivation** - This comes from inside you:
- The rush you get from swimming fast
- The satisfaction when you finally nail a basketball shot
- The energy boost you feel after a bike ride

**External Motivation** - This comes from outside you:
- Earning points in a fitness challenge
- Your mom noticing your improved soccer skills
- Avoiding losing video game privileges

<br/>
Both types of motivation work, but internal motivation sticks around longer. When you actually look forward to shooting hoops or dancing, you'll keep at it without anyone pushing you.

### Activity: Motivation Sorting

1. Get a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle
2. Label one side "Internal" and the other side "External"
3. Write these reasons for exercising in the correct column:

- "It makes me feel strong"
- "My parent said I should"
- "I love the feeling of moving fast"
- "To earn screen time"
- "It helps me sleep better"
- "To get better grades in PE"
4. Add two more reasons of your own to each column

<br/>
Success check: You've completed this activity correctly if you've placed all the reasons in the appropriate columns and added your own examples.

## Building Exercise Habits That Last

The best way to stay active is to make exercise a regular habit. Here's how:

<br/>
1. **Start small**

- Begin with just 10 minutes of activity
- Choose something you actually enjoy
- Exercise 2-3 times per week

2. **Gradually do more**

- Add 5 minutes to your workout each week
- Try new activities as you get stronger
- Slowly increase how many days you exercise

3. **Connect exercise to daily routines**

- Exercise right after another habit (like after brushing teeth)
- Do it at the same time each day
- Put your exercise clothes where you'll see them

## Home Exercise Plan Creation

### Setting Up Your Exercise Space
1. Find an area in your home where you have enough room to stretch your arms out in all directions without hitting anything
2. Clear the floor of any objects you might trip over
3. Have a water bottle nearby
4. If possible, use a mat, towel, or carpet for floor exercises

### Activity: Weekly Exercise Plan
Create a simple exercise plan for one week using this template:

| Day | Activity | Time | Location in Home |
|-----|----------|------|------------------|
| Monday | | | |
| Tuesday | | | |
| Wednesday | | | |
| Thursday | | | |
| Friday | | | |
| Saturday | | | |
| Sunday | | | |

**Instructions:**
1. Choose 3-4 days to be active (not every day needs an activity)
2. For each active day, write down:

- One specific activity you enjoy
- How long you'll do it (start with 10-15 minutes)
- Where in your home you'll do it

**Example of a completed day:**
| Day | Activity | Time | Location in Home |
|-----|----------|------|------------------|
| Monday | Dancing to 3 favorite songs | 12 minutes | Living room |

<br/>
Success check: Your plan is complete when you have 3-4 days filled in with specific activities, times, and locations.

## Using Support From Others

Having encouragement makes staying active much easier!

**Ways to get support:**
- Show a family member your exercise plan and ask them to check in with you once a week
- Tell someone in your household about your specific exercise goal
- Find kid-friendly workout videos you can follow at home
- Create a chart where family members can give you stickers or checkmarks when they see you being active


## Safety First!

### Home Exercise Safety Checklist
Before you start, make sure you can check off each item:

- [ ] I have at least 4 feet of clear space around me
- [ ] The floor is clear of toys, cords, and other tripping hazards
- [ ] I'm wearing comfortable clothes that won't catch on anything
- [ ] I have water nearby
- [ ] I've told someone in my house that I'm exercising
- [ ] I know to stop if I feel pain (not just muscle tiredness)

Always warm up for 5 minutes before exercising by marching in place, arm circles, and gentle stretches.

## Tracking Your Progress

Seeing your improvement helps you stay motivated!

### Creating Your Progress Tracker
Choose ONE of these tracking methods:

**Option 1: Activity Calendar**
1. Draw a grid with boxes for each day of the month
2. Color or place a sticker in each box when you complete your planned activity
3. At the end of the month, count how many days you were active

**Option 2: Achievement Tracker**
1. Choose ONE exercise (like jumping jacks, push-ups, or seconds held in a plank)
2. Test yourself once a week - how many can you do?
3. Record your number each week and watch it grow

**Option 3: Mood Monitor**
1. Draw a chart with columns for Date, Activity, and Mood
2. After each activity, rate your mood from 1-5 stars
3. Notice which activities consistently give you 4-5 stars

### Example Completed Tracker:

**Achievement Tracker Example:**
| Date | Exercise: Jumping Jacks | Notes |
|------|-------------------------|-------|
| Week 1 | 15 | Felt tired after |
| Week 2 | 18 | Getting easier! |
| Week 3 | 22 | Didn't need to stop |
| Week 4 | 25 | Breathing better now |

<br/>
Success check: Your tracker is ready when you've created one of the three options and filled in the first entry.

## Getting Back on Track

Everyone misses exercise days sometimes. Here's how to get back to your routine:

<br/>
1. **Be kind to yourself** - Don't get mad at yourself for missing days
2. **Start small again** - Do a shorter workout to get back into it
3. **Remember why you started** - Think about how good exercise makes you feel
4. **Adjust your plan** - Maybe you need a different time of day or activity

**Remember:** Missing a few days doesn't erase your progress!

### Troubleshooting Common Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| "I forget to exercise" | Set an alarm on a clock or phone |
| "I get bored quickly" | Create a playlist of your favorite songs to exercise to |
| "I don't have energy" | Try exercising earlier in the day or right after school |
| "My space is too small" | Find activities that need less space (like marching in place, yoga, or arm exercises) |
| "It feels too hard" | Cut your exercise time in half but still do something |

## Your Complete Motivation Plan

### Activity: Building Your Motivation Toolkit
Now that you understand motivation and habits, create your own motivation plan by completing each step:

<br/>
1. **My Favorite Activities:** Write down three physical activities you enjoy

- Example: Dancing, shooting baskets, riding my bike

2. **This Week's Goal:** Choose one small activity to do this week

- Example: 10 minutes of dancing after breakfast

3. **My Exercise Spot:** Take a photo or draw your home exercise space

- Make sure it shows the clear area you'll use

4. **My Support Person:** Write the name of someone who can check in on your progress

- Example: Mom will ask about my exercise on Friday

5. **My Tracking Method:** Create your chosen tracking tool from the options above
