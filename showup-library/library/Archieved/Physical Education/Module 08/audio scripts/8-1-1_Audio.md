Content to be covered:
Have you ever noticed how your breathing changes when you're nervous or excited? When we're stressed, our breathing often becomes shallow and quick, staying high in our chest. Belly breathing (sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing) is a simple but powerful technique that helps calm your body's stress response by engaging your diaphragm â€“ the dome-shaped muscle below your lungs.

Think of belly breathing like filling a balloon from the bottom up. When you breathe this way, you're using your lungs more fully and sending a signal to your brain that it's safe to relax. Many athletes, musicians, and even public speakers use this technique right before big performances to help them stay calm and focused.

1. Sit or lie down comfortably on a flat surface. If sitting, keep your back straight but not stiff.
2. Place one hand on your belly just below your ribs and one hand on your chest.
3. Take a slow breath in through your nose for a count of 3, feeling your belly push your hand out. Your chest should move only slightly.
4. Breathe out through your mouth for a count of 4, feeling your belly hand move inward.
5. Practice for 1 minute (about 6-8 complete breaths).

**Success Check:** You're doing it right if:
- Your belly hand moves more than your chest hand
- Your breathing feels smooth, not forced
- You can maintain a steady rhythm

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you feel dizzy: Slow down your breathing or take a break
- If your chest rises more than your belly: Try lying down instead of sitting
- If you can't focus: Count your breaths out loud to stay on track
