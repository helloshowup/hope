Content to be covered:
After practicing focused breathing techniques, the body scan is a natural next step that helps you become more aware of how stress affects your body. Many of us carry tension without even realizing it – maybe your shoulders creep up toward your ears during a math test, or your jaw tightens when you're playing a competitive game. The body scan helps you notice these tension spots so you can release them.

This practice is like being a detective in your own body, searching for clues about where you hold stress. Athletes often use body scans to check in with their muscles before and after practices or games. You might be surprised to discover areas of tension you weren't aware of! The more you practice, the faster you'll be able to notice and release tension throughout your day – whether you're sitting at your desk, standing in line, or getting ready for bed.

1. Lie down on your back on a comfortable surface with arms at your sides.
2. Close your eyes if comfortable, or maintain a soft gaze at the ceiling.
3. Begin at your toes: Wiggle them slightly, then deliberately relax them.
4. Move upward through each body part in this order:

- Feet (tighten by pointing toes, then relax)
- Calves (tighten by pulling heels toward you, then relax)
- Thighs (squeeze muscles, then release)
- Hips and lower back (gently press into the floor, then release)
- Stomach (tighten abdominal muscles, then release)
- Chest (take a deep breath, then let go completely)
- Hands (make fists, then release)
- Arms (tense biceps and triceps, then release)
- Shoulders (lift toward ears, then drop down)
- Neck (gently tilt chin to chest, then release)
- Face (scrunch all facial muscles, then relax)
5. Spend about 5-10 seconds on each body part.
