Now that you've mastered belly breathing, let's explore box breathing – a technique used by everyone from Navy SEALs to professional basketball players. Box breathing gets its name from the four equal parts that make up the practice, like the four sides of a square. This balanced breathing pattern is especially helpful when you need to stay calm under pressure, like during a tough game or before giving a class presentation.

The steady counting in box breathing gives your mind something specific to focus on, which can help quiet racing thoughts. Many students find this technique particularly helpful before tests or when they're feeling overwhelmed with homework. The best part is that you can practice it anywhere – at your desk, on the bus, or even while waiting in line – and no one will even notice you're doing it!

1. Sit in a comfortable position with your back supported.
2. Draw an imaginary square in front of you with your finger as you breathe:

- Bottom side: Breathe in for 4 counts
- Right side: Hold your breath for 4 counts
- Top side: Breathe out for 4 counts
- Left side: Hold your breath for 4 counts
3. Complete 5 full "boxes" (about 1-2 minutes total).

**Troubleshooting:**
- If holding your breath is difficult: Reduce to 2-count holds
- If you lose track: Focus just on equal-length breaths without holds
- If you feel anxious: Open your eyes and focus on a specific object while breathing
