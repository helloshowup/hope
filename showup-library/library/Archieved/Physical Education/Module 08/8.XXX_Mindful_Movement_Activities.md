## Places to Be Active in Your Community

### Parks and Playgrounds
Parks are free places to get moving! Most neighborhoods have parks with:

I've always loved exploring the parks in my neighborhood. When I was your age, the local park was like my second home after school. My friends and I would meet up almost every day to shoot hoops or just run around until dinner time.

Parks are amazing because they change with the seasons too. In summer, the wide open fields are perfect for frisbee or soccer, while in fall, the walking paths become even more beautiful with colorful leaves crunching under your feet. No matter what kind of movement you enjoy, parks usually have something for everyone.

- Walking paths
- Open fields for running or games
- Playgrounds with climbing equipment
- Basketball or tennis courts

**Activity: Park Finder**
1. List the names of 2-3 parks closest to your home
2. For each park, write down:

- How to get there (walking, biking, car, bus)
- 3 specific activities you could do there
- Any equipment you would need to bring

*Example:*
```
Lincoln Park

- Can walk there (15 minutes)
- Activities: basketball, walking the trail, using the playground equipment
- Need to bring: basketball, water bottle, sun protection
```

### Community Centers
Most towns have community centers that offer:

When I first visited our local community center, I was surprised by how much was happening inside! There were kids playing basketball in the gym, others swimming in the pool, and a group taking a hip-hop dance class. It felt like a hidden treasure in our town.

Community centers are especially great during bad weather when you can't be outside. Many offer day passes if you just want to try something out, and they often have special events on weekends or during school breaks. Some even have game rooms with ping pong tables or areas where you can just hang out with friends while being active.

- Swimming pools
- Gyms for basketball or volleyball
- Exercise classes for kids and teens
- Sports teams you can join

These centers usually have affordable programs or sometimes free days for students. Check your local center's website or call to ask about student discounts.

### Other Cool Places
Don't forget these active spots in your area:

Have you ever noticed how many places for movement are hiding in plain sight? Just last weekend, I discovered a bike trail behind the shopping center that I never knew existed, even though I've lived here for years! Sometimes the best activity spots are the ones you stumble upon by accident.

Your own neighborhood probably has secret spots perfect for being active. That empty lot where kids play kickball, the stairs at the library that make a great workout, or even the sidewalk outside your home where you can practice skateboarding tricks. Being active doesn't always mean going to an "official" place – sometimes the best movement happens in everyday spaces that you make your own.

- Bike paths or walking trails
- School playgrounds (after school hours)
- Skating rinks
- Bowling alleys
- Dance studios with beginner classes

## Finding Information About Activities

### How to Find Out What's Available
You can discover activities near you in several ways:

Finding fun activities used to be much harder before the internet! When I was growing up, we had to look through the newspaper or call places directly to find out what was happening. Now, information is everywhere – which can actually make it a bit overwhelming to sort through all the options.

The trick is to start with what interests you most. Do you like team sports? Individual activities? Being outdoors? Once you have an idea of what sounds fun, it's easier to search for specific opportunities. Don't be afraid to try something completely new, either. Some of the most enjoyable activities are ones you never expected to like until you gave them a chance!

<br/>
1. **Look online:** Visit your city's website or parks department page
2. **Scan bulletin boards:** Check libraries and grocery stores for activity flyers
3. **Ask around:** Talk to family members about activities they know about
4. **Social media:** Local community groups often post about upcoming events

### Activity: Become a Fitness Detective
Complete this research chart for one place in your community:

| Information to Find | Your Findings |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Name of location | |
| Complete address | |
| Hours open | |
| Cost (if any) | |
| 3 activities available there | |
| Equipment needed | |
| Transportation options | |

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If you can't find information online, write down the phone number to call
- If the location costs money, look for "free days" or student discounts
- If transportation is difficult, look for a closer alternative

## Free and Low-Cost Ways to Stay Active

Being active doesn't have to empty your wallet! In fact, some of the most fun ways to move your body cost absolutely nothing. Think about it – running, dancing, and playing tag are all free activities that people have enjoyed for generations.

When I was in middle school, my friends and I rarely had money for fancy sports equipment or classes. Instead, we made up games using whatever we had around. We'd use a rolled-up sock as a ball or draw hopscotch grids with chalk. Those simple activities were just as fun as anything that required expensive gear, and we could do them anytime we wanted.

You don't need expensive gear or gym memberships to get moving! Here are affordable ways to be active:

### At Parks or Outside

Some of my best childhood memories involve playing outside until the streetlights came on. There's something special about moving your body in the fresh air that just feels different from indoor activities. The park near my house had this big hill that we'd race up and down until we were completely out of breath – no equipment needed, just our own two feet and a lot of energy to burn!

- Walking or jogging around your block
- Playing catch with someone
- Jumping rope (ropes cost just a few dollars)
- Making an obstacle course with sticks, rocks, or other objects
- Going on a nature scavenger hunt

### At Home

Rainy days used to feel like such a bummer when I couldn't go outside to play. That's when I learned to get creative with indoor movement. My sister and I would push the coffee table aside and have dance contests in the living room. Mom wasn't always thrilled with our noise level, but she was happy we were staying active instead of just sitting around complaining about the weather.

- Dancing to music you like
- Making a hopscotch grid with masking tape
- Using stairs for exercise
- Lifting water bottles as weights
- Playing active games like Simon Says or Freeze Tag

**Equipment Alternatives:**
- No jump rope? Use a regular rope or cord
- No weights? Fill water bottles or use canned food items
- No sports equipment? Make balls from rolled-up socks
- No exercise mat? Use a folded blanket or towel
- No cones for marking? Use plastic cups or water bottles

**Safety Checklist:**
- [ ] I have told an adult where I'll be exercising
- [ ] I am staying in a safe, well-lit area
- [ ] I have water with me
- [ ] I am wearing appropriate shoes and clothing
- [ ] I have a plan if I need help (phone, nearby adult)

## Online Workouts When You Can't Go Out

Sometimes getting outside just isn't an option. Maybe it's pouring rain, or maybe you're stuck at home waiting for a delivery. Whatever the reason, those indoor days don't have to mean sitting still. The internet has opened up a whole world of movement options that you can do right in your living room, no matter what the weather is doing outside.

When the weather is bad or you can't leave home, online workouts are a great option. Many free workout videos exist specifically for middle schoolers!

### Types of Online Workouts

The variety of online workouts is pretty amazing these days. When I first started looking for workout videos, I expected boring exercise routines, but instead found everything from zombie-themed fitness games to dance workouts featuring my favorite songs. There's literally something for every interest and energy level, which makes it much easier to find something you'll actually want to do.

- Dance videos
- Yoga for kids
- Bodyweight exercises
- Sports skill practice
- Martial arts basics

### Finding Safe Online Workouts
Good workout videos should:

Not all workout videos are created equal, especially for middle school students. I remember trying to follow along with an adult workout once and feeling completely lost (and a little sore the next day!). The best videos for your age group explain things clearly and show modifications if something is too challenging. They should make you feel good about moving your body, not frustrated or left behind.

- Target kids or teens specifically
- Give clear instructions
- Show how to move correctly to avoid injuries
- Use minimal equipment
- Last an appropriate time (start with 10-15 minutes)

**Online Workout Selection Activity:**
1. Visit one of these kid-friendly fitness channels:

- GoNoodle
- Cosmic Kids Yoga
- KIDZ BOP Dance Along
- PE with Joe
2. Select and save/bookmark ONE specific video
3. Complete this workout evaluation:

| Workout Evaluation | Your Notes |
|-------------------|------------|
| Name of video | |
| Length of video | |
| Equipment needed | |
| Space needed | |
| Difficulty level (easy/medium/hard) | |
| What I liked about it | |
| What was challenging | |

**Troubleshooting Online Workouts:**
- Video too difficult? Look for "beginner" versions
- Limited space? Search for "small space workout"
- No sound available? Look for videos with clear visual demonstrations
- Internet issues? Download videos when connection is good to use later
