## Lesson 8.1: Breathing for Wellness: Mindful Movement and Relaxation

### Belly Breathing
"Have you ever noticed how your breathing changes when you're nervous or excited? When we're stressed, our breathing often becomes shallow and quick, staying high in our chest. Belly breathing (sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing) is a simple but powerful technique that helps calm your body's stress response by engaging your diaphragm – the dome-shaped muscle below your lungs.

Think of belly breathing like filling a balloon from the bottom up. When you breathe this way, you're using your lungs more fully and sending a signal to your brain that it's safe to relax. Many athletes, musicians, and even public speakers use this technique right before big performances to help them stay calm and focused." - Lesson 8.1

**Audio podcast included:** "Mastering Belly Breathing Technique" - provides step-by-step instructions for practicing belly breathing.

### Box Breathing
"Now that you've mastered belly breathing, let's explore box breathing – a technique used by everyone from Navy SEALs to professional basketball players. Box breathing gets its name from the four equal parts that make up the practice, like the four sides of a square. This balanced breathing pattern is especially helpful when you need to stay calm under pressure, like during a tough game or before giving a class presentation.

The steady counting in box breathing gives your mind something specific to focus on, which can help quiet racing thoughts. Many students find this technique particularly helpful before tests or when they're feeling overwhelmed with homework. The best part is that you can practice it anywhere – at your desk, on the bus, or even while waiting in line – and no one will even notice you're doing it!" - Lesson 8.1

### Body Scan
"After practicing focused breathing techniques, the body scan is a natural next step that helps you become more aware of how stress affects your body. Many of us carry tension without even realizing it – maybe your shoulders creep up toward your ears during a math test, or your jaw tightens when you're playing a competitive game. The body scan helps you notice these tension spots so you can release them.

This practice is like being a detective in your own body, searching for clues about where you hold stress. Athletes often use body scans to check in with their muscles before and after practices or games. You might be surprised to discover areas of tension you weren't aware of! The more you practice, the faster you'll be able to notice and release tension throughout your day – whether you're sitting at your desk, standing in line, or getting ready for bed." - Lesson 8.1

**Audio podcast included:** "Complete Body Scan Relaxation" - provides guided instructions for conducting a full body scan while incorporating mindful breathing.
