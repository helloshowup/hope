<h2 style="color: #920205;">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p style="color: #920205;">By the end of this session, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Practice at least two types of calm breathing techniques independently</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Demonstrate how to match your breath with simple movements</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #920205;">Identify specific times in your daily routine when these skills will be most helpful</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>add  file</li>
</ul>
<p>Breathing techniques and mindful movement can help you handle stress and sharpen your focus. You'll practice simple activities that build useful skills for PE class and everyday situations - like before tests or when you feel overwhelmed. These mindfulness skills complement our previous work with game adaptations by adding a new dimension to physical movement.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your Practice Space</h2>
<p>1\ Find a quiet area where you won't be disturbed for 15-20 minutes<br />
2\ Clear any tripping hazards from your practice area<br />
3\ Turn off or silence notifications on devices<br />
4\ Have your timer within reach<br />
5\ If possible, dim lights or find natural lighting that feels calming</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how your breathing changes when you're nervous or excited? When we're stressed, our breathing often becomes shallow and quick, staying high in our chest. Belly breathing (sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing) is a simple but powerful technique that helps calm your body's stress response by engaging your diaphragm – the dome-shaped muscle below your lungs.</p>
<p>Think of belly breathing like filling a balloon from the bottom up. When you breathe this way, you're using your lungs more fully and sending a signal to your brain that it's safe to relax. Many athletes, musicians, and even public speakers use this technique right before big performances to help them stay calm and focused.</p>
<p>1\ Sit or lie down comfortably on a flat surface. If sitting, keep your back straight but not stiff.<br />
2\ Place one hand on your belly just below your ribs and one hand on your chest.<br />
3\ Take a slow breath in through your nose for a count of 3, feeling your belly push your hand out. Your chest should move only slightly.<br />
4\ Breathe out through your mouth for a count of 4, feeling your belly hand move inward.<br />
5\ Practice for 1 minute (about 6-8 complete breaths).</p>
<p><strong>Success Check:</strong> You're doing it right if:<br />
- Your belly hand moves more than your chest hand<br />
- Your breathing feels smooth, not forced<br />
- You can maintain a steady rhythm</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong><br />
- If you feel dizzy: Slow down your breathing or take a break<br />
- If your chest rises more than your belly: Try lying down instead of sitting<br />
- If you can't focus: Count your breaths out loud to stay on track</p>
<h2>Box Breathing</h2>

<p>Now that you've mastered belly breathing, let's explore box breathing – a technique used by everyone from Navy SEALs to professional basketball players. Box breathing gets its name from the four equal parts that make up the practice, like the four sides of a square. This balanced breathing pattern is especially helpful when you need to stay calm under pressure, like during a tough game or before giving a class presentation.</p>
<p>The steady counting in box breathing gives your mind something specific to focus on, which can help quiet racing thoughts. Many students find this technique particularly helpful before tests or when they're feeling overwhelmed with homework. The best part is that you can practice it anywhere – at your desk, on the bus, or even while waiting in line – and no one will even notice you're doing it!</p>
<p>1\ Sit in a comfortable position with your back supported.<br />
2. Draw an imaginary square in front of you with your finger as you breathe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bottom side: Breathe in for 4 counts</li>
<li>Right side: Hold your breath for 4 counts</li>
<li>Top side: Breathe out for 4 counts</li>
<li>Left side: Hold your breath for 4 counts<br />
3\ Complete 5 full "boxes" (about 1-2 minutes total).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong><br />
- If holding your breath is difficult: Reduce to 2-count holds<br />
- If you lose track: Focus just on equal-length breaths without holds<br />
- If you feel anxious: Open your eyes and focus on a specific object while breathing</p>
<h2>Body Scan</h2>

<p>After practicing focused breathing techniques, the body scan is a natural next step that helps you become more aware of how stress affects your body. Many of us carry tension without even realizing it – maybe your shoulders creep up toward your ears during a math test, or your jaw tightens when you're playing a competitive game. The body scan helps you notice these tension spots so you can release them.</p>
<p>This practice is like being a detective in your own body, searching for clues about where you hold stress. Athletes often use body scans to check in with their muscles before and after practices or games. You might be surprised to discover areas of tension you weren't aware of! The more you practice, the faster you'll be able to notice and release tension throughout your day – whether you're sitting at your desk, standing in line, or getting ready for bed.</p>
<p>1\ Lie down on your back on a comfortable surface with arms at your sides.<br />
2\ Close your eyes if comfortable, or maintain a soft gaze at the ceiling.<br />
3\ Begin at your toes: Wiggle them slightly, then deliberately relax them.<br />
4. Move upward through each body part in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feet (tighten by pointing toes, then relax)</li>
<li>Calves (tighten by pulling heels toward you, then relax)</li>
<li>Thighs (squeeze muscles, then release)</li>
<li>Hips and lower back (gently press into the floor, then release)</li>
<li>Stomach (tighten abdominal muscles, then release)</li>
<li>Chest (take a deep breath, then let go completely)</li>
<li>Hands (make fists, then release)</li>
<li>Arms (tense biceps and triceps, then release)</li>
<li>Shoulders (lift toward ears, then drop down)</li>
<li>Neck (gently tilt chin to chest, then release)</li>
<li>Face (scrunch all facial muscles, then relax)<br />
5\ Spend about 5-10 seconds on each body part.</li>

<h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
<p>Think of these breathing and movement techniques as tools in your personal wellness toolkit. Just like you might reach for different tools to fix different problems around the house, these techniques can help you handle various challenges throughout your day. Many students find that starting with just one technique used consistently (like box breathing before a quiz) helps build the habit before adding more practices to their routine.</p>
<p>Remember that these skills improve with practice, just like learning a new sport or instrument. You might feel a little awkward at first, but with regular practice, these movements will start to feel natural. Many professional athletes and performers use these exact same techniques before big games or performances to help them stay calm and focused when it matters most.</p>
<p>1\ Review the techniques you've learned and circle your favorite one.<br />
2\ Complete the planning chart<br />
3\ Set a specific reminder (phone alert, sticky note) to practice tomorrow.<br />
4\ After practicing, note one thing you noticed about how your body or mind responded.</p>
