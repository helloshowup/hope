# 8.2  Inclusive Game Design for everyone

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Explain what makes a game fair for all players
- Show three ways to adapt games for all to join in
- Create your own game that everyone can play

## Ability Awareness Activity

Before we jump into designing inclusive games, it's important to understand what it feels like when activities aren't designed for everyone. Sometimes we don't notice barriers until we experience them ourselves. This hands-on activity will help you feel what it's like to have different physical limitations, even if just for a short time.

Think about your favorite physical activities or games. Now imagine trying to play them with one arm in a cast, or while sitting in a wheelchair, or with limited vision. How would that change your experience? This activity will give you a small taste of those challenges and help you become more aware of how games can be designed better.

## Principles of Inclusive Game Design

After trying the awareness activity, you probably noticed how challenging everyday games can be when you have different abilities. It's like trying to ride a bike with a flat tire - you can still do it, but it's much harder and not as fun! This is why inclusive game design is so important in physical education and beyond.

When we create games that everyone can enjoy, we're not just being nice - we're making the games better for everyone. Think about ramps on sidewalks - they were designed for people in wheelchairs, but they also help people with strollers, bikes, and rolling luggage. The same idea applies to games - when we make them more inclusive, they often become more fun and creative for everyone!

1. **Multiple Ways to Play**: Games need different roles and participation options

   *Example*: During basketball, players might shoot, pass, coach, or keep score

2. **Adjustable Challenge Levels**: Games should be easy to modify for different skill levels

   *Example*: In target games, players choose their distance from the target

3. **Teamwork Over Competition**: Focus on collaboration rather than just winning

   *Example*: Group challenges where players try to beat their previous best score

4. **Adaptations for Different Abilities**: Modify rules or equipment to include everyone

   *Example*: Using beach balls instead of volleyballs, or creating seated versions of standing games


## Apply What You've Learned

Let's put these principles into action! Think about a game you enjoy playing with your friends.

1. Choose a game you're familiar with (like soccer, tag, or board games)
2. Fill in this chart to make your game more inclusive:

| Principle | How it appears (or doesn't) in your game | How you could add or improve it |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Multiple Ways to Play |  |  |
| Adjustable Challenge |  |  |
| Teamwork Focus |  |  |
| Adaptations |  |  |

You don't need any special materials - just your thinking cap and maybe a pencil if you want to write down your ideas!

**CHECKPOINT:** Think about a time when you or someone you know couldn't fully participate in a game or activity because of the way it was designed. How did that feel, and what simple change could have made the experience better for everyone?

## Key Takeaways

- Inclusive games provide multiple ways to participate, allowing everyone to contribute regardless of their abilities or skill levels.
- Making small adaptations to rules, equipment, or spaces can transform a game from excluding some players to welcoming all players.
- When games focus on teamwork and adjustable challenges rather than just competition, they become more enjoyable and meaningful for everyone involved.
