**What you need:** Small space for movement (at least 4x4 feet)
**Time needed:** Start with 3 minutes, then build up as you get comfortable

**Setup instructions:**
- Clear away any objects you might trip over
- Have water nearby for when you get thirsty
- Wear shoes if you're on a hard floor

Pick from these quick activities:

- Jumping jacks - Start with 10, then rest. Do 3 sets.
- Invisible jump rope - Pretend to jump rope for 30 seconds, rest for 15 seconds. Repeat 4 times.
- Dance party - Play a favorite song and move however you want for the whole song!

**Success check:** You'll know it's working when:
- Your breathing gets faster
- You feel warmer
- Your mind feels clearer after finishing

**Modifications for different needs:**
- Need quiet? Try "silent" versions: Step side to side instead of jumping, or do slow-motion movements
- Limited space? March in place or do seated arm circles
- Different abilities? Stay seated and do arm movements to the same rhythm
