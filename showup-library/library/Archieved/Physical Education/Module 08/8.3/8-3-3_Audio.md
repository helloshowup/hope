File name: 8-3-3.mp3
Content to be covered:
**What you need:** Any spot where you can sit or lie down comfortably
**Time needed:** 3-5 minutes minimum

**Setup instructions:**
- Find a quiet spot away from distractions
- Turn off or silence your phone
- Sit against a wall or lie on your bed for support

Steps to follow:
1. Sit comfortably or lie on your back
2. Rest one hand on your belly
3. Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 counts (belly expands)
4. Hold for 2 counts
5. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 counts
6. Continue for at least 10 cycles

**Success check:** You're doing it right when:
- Your hand on your belly rises when you breathe in
- Your breathing slows down
- Your thoughts become less jumpy
- You feel more relaxed after 10 cycles

**Troubleshooting:**
- Mind wandering? Gently bring attention back to counting your breaths
- Can't breathe deeply? Start with shorter counts (2 in, 1 hold, 3 out)
- Feeling anxious? Open your eyes and focus on something in the room
