Script title: Releasing Body Tension Through Stretching
File name: 8-3-1.mp3
Content to be covered:
**What you need:** Your body and arm-stretching space (about 3 feet around you)
**Time needed:** About 5 minutes at your own pace

**Setup instructions:**
- Find a spot where you won't bump into furniture
- Wear comfortable clothes that let you move freely
- Stand on a carpet or rug for better balance

Follow these steps:
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Breathe in while lifting shoulders toward ears
3. Hold for 3 seconds, noticing the tension
4. Exhale and drop shoulders, letting tension go
5. Repeat 5 times
6. Try with other body parts - clench fists then release, scrunch face then relax

**Success check:** You've done this correctly when you feel the difference between tension and relaxation in each body part.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you feel dizzy: Slow down your breathing or try sitting instead of standing
- If you don't feel much difference: Exaggerate the tension more when you tighten up

**Safety tip:** Stop if it hurts. You should feel a gentle stretch, not pain.
