# 1.2 Test Your Fitness Superpowers!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Name the 4 parts of fitness
- Try each fitness test on your own
- Track your scores to see how you improve

Everyone has different natural strengths - some people might be super flexible while others have amazing endurance. The cool thing is that no matter where you start, you can improve in all areas with practice.

Curious about your own fitness abilities? Try these simple tests:

### Cardiovascular Endurance Test

Let's start by checking how well your heart and lungs work together to keep your body moving. Cardiovascular endurance is all about how long you can keep going during physical activity without getting too tired. This first test will get your heart pumping!

**Jumping Jacks Challenge**

1. Set a timer for 1 minute
2. Do as many jumping jacks as you can
3. Count how many you complete
4. Can you do more than 50 with good form? That's pretty impressive!

### Muscular Strength Test

Now that you've warmed up your body with jumping jacks, let's see how strong your muscles are! Muscular strength is about how much force your muscles can produce in a single effort. Push-ups are a great way to test the strength in your arms, chest, and core all at once.

**Push-Up Challenge**

1. Start in a plank position with your hands under your shoulders
2. Lower your body until your elbows form 90-degree angles (like an L shape)
3. Push back up to the starting position
4. Count how many push-ups you can do with good form
5. Write down your number and try to beat it next time!

### Muscular Endurance Test

Your arms might be feeling a bit tired after those push-ups - that's perfect! Now we'll test something different: how long your muscles can work without getting tired. While strength is about power, endurance is about lasting power. Let's see how your leg muscles hold up in this next challenge.

**Wall Sit Challenge**

1. Stand with your back against a wall
2. Slide down until your knees are bent at 90 degrees (like sitting in an invisible chair)
3. Time how long you can hold this position
4. Try to improve your time each week!

### Flexibility Test

For our final test, let's slow things down and check your flexibility. Being flexible helps you move more easily and can prevent injuries. After all that muscle work, a good stretch probably feels pretty nice right about now!

**Sit and Reach**

1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you
2. Reach forward toward your toes
3. Notice how far you can reach - can you touch your toes?
4. Regular stretching will help you reach further!

## Key Takeaways
- Physical fitness consists of four key components: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility, each measuring different abilities of your body.
- Simple tests like jumping jacks, push-ups, wall sits, and toe touches help you measure your current fitness levels and track improvements over time.
- Everyone has natural strengths in different fitness areas, but regular practice can improve all components regardless of your starting point.
