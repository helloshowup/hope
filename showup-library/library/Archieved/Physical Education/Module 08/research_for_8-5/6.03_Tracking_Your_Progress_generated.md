## Setting Goals That Grow With You

From Lesson 6.4 (Tracking Your Progress):

"Tracking your fitness turns exercise from something you just do into something you can actually measure and feel good about. Plus, when you write things down or record them, your brain pays more attention to what you're doing, which helps you make better choices about staying active." - Lesson 6.4, Tracking Your Progress

"Tracking what you do during workouts helps you know where you started and how far you've come. Here's why it's worth doing:
- **See Your Improvements**: Looking back at your records shows how much stronger or faster you've become
- **Stay Motivated**: Seeing your progress makes it easier to keep exercising, especially on tough days
- **Set Better Goals**: Your records help you create realistic targets based on what you've already done
- **Build Confidence**: Nothing beats the feeling of looking back and seeing how much you've improved" - Lesson 6.4, Tracking Your Progress

"Milestone tracking is perfect if you like to challenge yourself and celebrate specific achievements. It's like leveling up in real life! Instead of focusing on daily workouts, you're aiming to reach certain fitness abilities - like being able to hold a plank longer or run without stopping." - Lesson 6.4, Tracking Your Progress

"**Step 4: Set Specific Goals**
Write down 2-3 specific, measurable goals:

Example poor goal: "Get better at running"
Example good goal: "Be able to jog for 10 minutes without stopping by November 1st"" - Lesson 6.4, Tracking Your Progress

"Tracking isn't just about physical improvements - it teaches you to set goals, stick with them, and celebrate when you succeed. These skills will help you in many areas of your life. When exercise feels challenging, your records will remind you of how far you've come and encourage you to keep going." - Lesson 6.4, Tracking Your Progress
