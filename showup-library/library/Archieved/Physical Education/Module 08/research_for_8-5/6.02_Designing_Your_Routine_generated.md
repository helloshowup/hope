# Setting Goals That Grow With You

## From Lesson 6.2 (Designing Your Routine):

"When you're just starting out with fitness, it's easy to get super excited and plan to exercise every day for an hour. But that's kind of like deciding to read an entire book in one night - it's too much at once! Instead, think about what you can actually do with your current schedule and energy level. Maybe that's just 15 minutes three times a week to begin with, and that's perfectly okay. The most important thing is to start with something you can definitely accomplish." - Lesson 6.2, Designing Your Routine

"Starting with smaller goals and building up gives you much better results than trying to do too much at once!" - Lesson 6.2, Designing Your Routine

"After following your plan for one week, use this self-assessment checklist:
- [ ] I completed all my planned workout sessions
- [ ] The intensity level felt appropriate (challenging but doable)
- [ ] I had enough energy to complete each session
- [ ] I enjoyed at least some of the activities
- [ ] I'm seeing or feeling small improvements" - Lesson 6.2, Designing Your Routine

"Based on your answers, here's how to adjust:

**If it feels too easy** (you checked all boxes and felt you could do more):
1. Keep frequency the same
2. Increase just ONE of these:
   - Intensity: Add 1-2 points to your target effort level
   - Time: Add 5 minutes to your sessions
   - Type: Try the more challenging version of an exercise (regular push-ups instead of wall push-ups)

**If it feels too hard** (you couldn't check most boxes):
1. Keep frequency the same
2. Decrease just ONE of these:
   - Intensity: Lower your target effort by 2-3 points
   - Time: Reduce sessions by 5-10 minutes
   - Type: Try the easier version of exercises (wall push-ups instead of regular)" - Lesson 6.2, Designing Your Routine

"As you get stronger and build more stamina, you might want to try this:

**Intermediate Schedule:**
- Monday: 30-minute jog or fast walk (cardio)
- Tuesday: 20 minutes of strength exercises with resistance bands or household items (strength)
- Wednesday: 20 minutes of yoga following an online video (flexibility)
- Thursday: 30 minutes of dancing to your favorite music or cycling (cardio)
- Friday: Rest day
- Saturday: 45 minutes practicing sports skills or playing an active game (fun activity)
- Sunday: 15 minutes of stretching (recovery)" - Lesson 6.2, Designing Your Routine
