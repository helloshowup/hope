## Setting Goals That Grow With You
**Self-Assessment and Tracking** – Lesson 2.4, Balance and Coordination
"Keeping track of your progress is one of the most motivating parts of developing any new skill. When you record your efforts, you create a visual history of your improvement that can encourage you on days when practice feels challenging. A simple tracking system doesn't need to be fancy - just consistent. Consider creating a small notebook or chart where you record these key elements after each practice session:

1. Date
2. Activity practiced
3. Measurement (time held, steps taken, successful catches, etc.)
4. Notes (how it felt, what was challenging)

Example entry:
```
Date: June 5
Activity: One-leg stand
Measurement: 12 seconds (right leg), 9 seconds (left leg)
Notes: Felt more stable when focusing on a spot on the wall
```"

**Weekly Challenge** – Lesson 2.4, Balance and Coordination
"To see real improvement, choose one balance activity and one coordination activity to practice every day for a week. Record your starting point on day 1 and your ending point on day 7. Look for these specific improvements:

- Static balance: Increased time holding positions
- Dynamic balance: Smoother movements with fewer missteps
- Coordination: More successful catches/hits and faster completion times"

**Improving Balance and Coordination** – Lesson 2.4, Balance and Coordination
"Like any skill worth developing, balance and coordination improve with consistent practice and the right approach. Think of these abilities as muscles that get stronger when you challenge them regularly. The key is finding the right level of difficulty - activities should be challenging enough to make you work but not so difficult that you can't experience success. As you practice, you'll notice your brain and body working together more efficiently, making movements that once seemed difficult feel natural and automatic.

- Practice regularly - even just 5-10 minutes daily makes a noticeable difference
- Begin with simpler versions of activities and gradually increase the difficulty
- Pay attention to your breathing and keep your core muscles tight (the muscles in your stomach and lower back)
- Don't be discouraged by wobbles or falls - they're part of the learning process

You can easily add practice to your daily routine! Try balancing on one foot while brushing your teeth or work on coordination skills during TV advert breaks!"
