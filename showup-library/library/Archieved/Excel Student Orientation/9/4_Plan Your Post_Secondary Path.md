# Plan Your Post‑Secondary Path

<explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this worksheet more human-like and appropriate for high school students:

1. Removed the formal "This interactive worksheet will help you..." introduction and replaced it with a more direct, conversational opening
2. Changed American spellings to British (e.g., "counsellor" instead of "counselor")
3. Replaced all instances of "essential" with more natural alternatives
4. Added "Over to You" headings for reflection sections
5. Varied sentence structures to avoid the repetitive AI pattern
6. Made language more conversational while maintaining professionalism
7. Simplified some complex instructions
8. Added more personal touches that speak directly to the student
9. Maintained the structured format needed for an interactive worksheet
