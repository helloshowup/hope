## Important Reminders

- **Deadlines Matter**: College application and registration deadlines are firm and typically occur several weeks before classes begin.
- **Dual Credit Verification**: Not all college courses automatically qualify for high school credit. Always verify through the approval process.
- **Academic Standards**: You must maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA in your college courses to remain in the dual enrolment programme.
- **Communication is Key**: Regularly check your Excel High School email and college email accounts for important updates.

## Next Steps

Your most immediate action is to submit a Help Desk ticket for dual enrolment approval. This is a critical step that must be completed before you can officially participate in the dual enrolment programme.

To submit your Dual Enrolment Approval Request, go to: excelhs.com/helpdesk

Our dual enrolment coordinators will review your request within 3-5 business days and provide further guidance on finalising your enrolment. Starting this process at least 6-8 weeks before the college semester begins will give you enough time to complete all requirements.

If you have questions at any point, don't hesitate to reach out to our academic counselling team through the Help Desk. We're here to help you navigate this exciting educational opportunity!
