# Inside Our University Partnerships

## Video Script: Excel High School University Partnerships (90 seconds)

### Opening (0:00-0:15)

**Narrator:** "Excel High School works with accredited colleges and universities across the country to help you earn college credit while finishing your high school diploma."

### Student Testimonial (0:16-0:35)
*[Visual: High school student in home study environment, speaking directly to camera, with brief shots of them working on coursework]*

**Emma (Excel Student):** "I honestly didn't think I could earn college credits in high school. Through Excel's dual credit programme, I've already completed 12 college credits that will transfer to my university next fall. The courses were challenging but totally worth it - I've saved over $4,000 in tuition fees!"

### Success Coach Segment (0:36-1:15)
*[Visual: Professional setting with Success Coach speaking to camera, intercut with footage of campus environments]*

**Michael Rodriguez (Success Coach):** "What makes our university partnerships so valuable is our transfer-credit guarantee. Each dual credit course at Excel High School aligns perfectly with our partner institutions' requirements.

When you complete these courses, you receive both high school and college credit simultaneously. We have agreements with universities that ensure these credits transfer smoothly to any of our partner schools.

Your Success Coach will help you select the right courses based on your future goals, making the whole process straightforward. This approach saves time and money while building your confidence and college readiness in a supportive high school environment."
