Strong study skills make all the difference when learning online. Since you're studying at Excel High School, your learning experience is quite different from a traditional classroom, and you'll need specific strategies to do well. Let's explore six core study skills that are particularly valuable for online learners like you. These techniques won't just boost your grades—they'll help you develop habits that serve you well throughout your education and beyond.

### Core Concept 1: Understanding and Using Rubrics

A rubric is basically your secret weapon for academic success. Think of it as a roadmap showing exactly what your teachers expect and how they'll grade your work.

**Why rubrics matter:**
- They show you exactly what to include in your assignment
- They explain how points are distributed
- They help you focus on what's most important
- They allow you to review your work before submitting

**How to use rubrics effectively:**
1. Read the rubric carefully before you start working on an assignment
2. Highlight or note the key requirements
3. Compare your work against the rubric as you progress
4. Use the rubric as a final checklist before submitting

Many students skip looking at the rubric and then wonder why they didn't get the grade they expected. Taking just a few minutes to understand the rubric can make a real difference in your marks.

### Core Concept 2: Accuracy in Specific-Answer Tasks

Online courses often include assignments with specific-answer questions like multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, or short answer responses. Unlike essays where there's room for interpretation, these questions usually have one correct answer. Here's how to improve your accuracy:

1. **Read carefully:** Make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking
2. **Pay attention to details:** Note keywords, units of measurement, or specific terminology required
3. **Show your work:** Even if not required, writing out your process helps catch errors
4. **Double-check before submitting:** Take time to review your answers
5. **Learn from mistakes:** When you get answers wrong, understand why so you don't repeat the error

Remember that in an online environment, small details matter. Taking an extra minute to verify your answers can significantly improve your scores.

### Core Concept 3: Implementing Spaced Review

Have you ever crammed for a test the night before, only to forget everything a week later? Spaced review is the solution to this common problem. This technique involves reviewing material multiple times over increasing intervals, rather than all at once.

**How to implement spaced review:**
1. First review: Within 24 hours of learning new material
2. Second review: 2-3 days later
3. Third review: One week later
4. Additional reviews: At increasingly longer intervals (2 weeks, 1 month)

This approach works because it helps move information from short-term to long-term memory. It's particularly helpful for online students who need to manage their own study schedules.

**Tips for effective spaced review:**
- Use a calendar to plan your review sessions
- Keep review sessions active by quizzing yourself
- Mix up different subjects during study sessions
- Use different methods to review (flashcards, summaries, practise problems)

### Core Concept 4: Utilising the EHS Writing Lab

Excel High School provides a valuable resource that many students overlook: the EHS Writing Lab. This service can help you improve your writing skills and assignment quality across all subjects.

**What the Writing Lab offers:**
- Feedback on drafts before submission
- Help with grammar, organisation, and clarity
- Guidance on proper citation and formatting
- Suggestions for strengthening your arguments

**How to make the most of the Writing Lab:**
1. Submit your drafts early, not the day before the deadline
2. Be specific about what kind of help you need
3. Review the feedback carefully and apply it to your work
4. Use the service regularly to improve your writing over time

The Writing Lab isn't just for English class—it can help with history papers, science lab reports, and any other written assignments. Students who regularly use this resource often see significant improvements in their grades.

### Core Concept 5: Creating a Dedicated Study Space

Your physical environment has a big impact on your ability to focus and learn effectively. As an online student, having a dedicated study space is particularly important since you don't have the structure of a physical classroom.

**Elements of an effective study space:**
- A quiet location with minimal distractions
- Good lighting to reduce eye strain
- A comfortable chair and desk at the proper height
- Organised supplies and materials
- Limited access to phones or other distractions

Your study space doesn't need to be fancy—it could be a desk in your bedroom, a corner of the dining table, or even a spot at your local library. What matters is that when you're in this space, your brain associates it with focused learning.

### Core Concept 6: Active Engagement with Material

One challenge of online learning is staying actively engaged with the material. Without a teacher physically present, it's easy to passively read or watch content without truly processing it. Active learning techniques help you interact with the material more deeply:

1. **Take meaningful notes:** Don't just copy text—summarise concepts in your own words
2. **Ask questions:** Write down questions as you study and seek answers
3. **Teach the material:** Explain concepts out loud as if teaching someone else
4. **Apply concepts:** Look for real-world applications of what you're learning
5. **Connect ideas:** Draw connections between new information and things you already know

These active engagement strategies help you process information more deeply, leading to better understanding and retention.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your most recent assignment. How could you have used the rubric more effectively to improve your work?

2. What specific-answer tasks do you find most challenging in your current courses? Which strategies from this lesson might help you improve your accuracy?

3. Consider your current study routine. How might you incorporate spaced review techniques? What benefits do you think this approach would provide for you personally?

### Check Your Understanding

1. What is the primary purpose of a rubric in academic assignments?
   A. To provide a scoring guide and outline expectations
   B. To list required textbooks for the course

2. Which of the following is NOT a recommended strategy for spaced review?
   A. Starting to study early
   B. Creating a regular study schedule
   C. Cramming the night before an exam
   D. Mixing up subjects during study sessions

3. How can the EHS Writing Lab best be utilised?
   A. Only for final drafts of English papers
   B. As a service that writes papers for you
   C. For early drafts and ongoing writing improvement across subjects
   D. Only when you're certain you'll get a poor grade

### Summary

These six key study skills form the foundation for effective online learning at Excel High School: understanding rubrics, ensuring accuracy in specific-answer tasks, implementing spaced review, utilising the EHS Writing Lab, creating a dedicated study space, and actively engaging with course material. Together, they'll significantly boost your academic success.
