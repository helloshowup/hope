## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 3

**Lesson Title:** Building Your Weekly Study Plan

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Create a personalised weekly study planner using the provided template
- Set SMART goals for each active course
- Schedule monthly check-ins with their Success Coach
- Identify potential challenges and locate relevant resources

Finding a balance between flexibility and structure is one of the biggest challenges for online students. While Excel High School gives you the freedom to learn at your own pace, managing this freedom effectively requires good planning. This lesson will help you create a study plan that works with your unique schedule and learning style, improving your time management and setting you up for success.

### Core Concept 1: Creating Your Weekly Study Planner

The foundation of your study plan is the Excel High School Weekly Planner template. This customisable tool helps you organise your academic commitments and personal responsibilities in one place. Here's how to make the most of it:

1. Course Mapping: List all your active courses in the left column. This gives you a clear overview of your current academic load.

2. Daily Login Goals: Set specific times each day when you'll log in to the learning platform. Consistency is key in online learning, so aim for daily engagement, even if it's just for 15-20 minutes on busy days.

3. Weekly Targets: For each course, establish specific completion goals for the week. This might be finishing a certain number of lessons, completing a section, or submitting an assignment.

4. Progress Tracker: Use the built-in tracking features to visualise your advancement toward course completion. This visual reminder can be motivating!

When filling out your planner, think about your personal schedule, energy levels throughout the day, and other commitments. Be realistic – it's better to start with modest goals and build up than to overcommit and feel discouraged.

Remember, this planner is a flexible tool that can change over time. As you progress through your courses, you may need to adjust your schedule. The goal is to create a routine that works for you and supports your learning journey.

### Core Concept 2: Setting SMART Goals for Each Course

For each active course in your Excel High School programme, you'll want to set SMART goals. SMART stands for:

- Specific: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
- Measurable: Include concrete criteria to measure progress
- Achievable: Set goals that are challenging but attainable
- Relevant: Make sure the goal aligns with your overall educational objectives
- Time-bound: Set a specific timeframe for achieving the goal

Here's an example of a SMART goal for a course:
"Complete Section 3 of Algebra I, including all practice exercises and the section test, with a score of 80% or higher by Friday at 5 PM."

This goal is specific (Section 3 of Algebra I), measurable (80% score), achievable (assuming appropriate pacing), relevant (part of the course curriculum), and time-bound (by Friday at 5 PM).

When setting your SMART goals:
1. Review your course syllabus and upcoming assignments
2. Break larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks
3. Consider your personal schedule and other commitments
4. Write your goals in the designated section of your weekly planner

By setting SMART goals for each course, you create a clear roadmap for success in your programme.

### Core Concept 3: Leveraging Support and Addressing Challenges

Your weekly study plan should include strategies for getting support and overcoming obstacles. Two key elements to incorporate are:

1. Scheduling Success Coach Check-ins:
   Your Excel High School Success Coach is a valuable resource for guidance and support. Make it a habit to schedule monthly check-ins by:
   - Using the checkbox in your planner to remind you to book appointments
   - Preparing specific questions or topics you want to discuss in advance
   - Following up on any action items from previous meetings

   These regular check-ins help you stay accountable and provide an opportunity to discuss your progress, challenges, and goals with someone who can offer personalised guidance.

2. Identifying and Addressing Challenges:
   Proactively addressing potential roadblocks is a smart way to maintain progress. In your planner:
   - Identify your top two challenges for the week (e.g., difficult concept, time management)
   - Use the provided links to access relevant resources (tutoring services, study guides, etc.)
   - Develop a specific plan to tackle each challenge

   Excel High School offers various support options, including tutorial videos, subject-specific study guides, and technical support. Your Success Coach can help you navigate these resources effectively.

By regularly engaging with your Success Coach and actively problem-solving, you'll build resilience and maintain momentum in your studies.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your typical week. What specific time slots could you dedicate to studying for each of your courses? Consider when you feel most alert and focused.

2. For a course you're currently taking, write a SMART goal you could set for the upcoming week.

3. Reflect on a recent academic challenge you faced. What resources or strategies could have helped you overcome it more effectively?
