Thinking about taking college courses while still in high school? Concurrent enrolment might be for you. This opportunity can give you a head start on college credits while you're still working toward your Excel High School diploma. But before diving in, you'll need to understand how it works, who qualifies, and what steps to take. We'll break down the differences between concurrent and part-time enrolment, walk through a real student's experience, and help you decide if this path makes sense for your educational journey.

### Core Concept 1: Definition of Concurrent vs. Part-time Enrolment

Concurrent enrolment and part-time enrolment offer different paths for your academic journey at Excel High School. Here's what sets them apart:

**Concurrent Enrolment:**
- Taking college-level courses while still enrolled as a full-time high school student
- Earning credits that may count toward both your high school diploma and future college degree
- Maintaining your full course load at Excel High School while adding college coursework
- Experiencing college-level academic expectations while still having high school support

**Part-time Enrolment:**
- Taking fewer than the standard number of courses at Excel High School
- Not necessarily involving any college-level coursework
- Reducing your high school course load, often due to special circumstances
- Potentially extending the time needed to complete your high school diploma

**Key Differences:**
1. **Academic Level:** Concurrent enrolment exposes you to college-level work, while part-time enrolment stays within high school academics.

2. **Credit Application:** Concurrent enrolment can earn you credits that apply to both high school and college requirements. Part-time enrolment only affects your high school credits.

3. **Workload:** Concurrent enrolment typically increases your overall workload, while part-time enrolment reduces it.

4. **Purpose:** Concurrent enrolment prepares you for higher education and gives you a taste of college life, while part-time enrolment often accommodates personal circumstances like health issues, work commitments, or family responsibilities.

Understanding these differences will help you decide which option might best suit your educational goals and personal situation.

### Core Concept 2: Eligibility Checklist and Approval Workflow

Before jumping into concurrent enrolment, you'll need to meet certain requirements and follow a specific approval process. This helps make sure you're ready for the demands of college-level work.

**Eligibility Checklist:**
- Academic standing: Minimum GPA of 3.0 in your Excel High School courses
- Grade level: Typically open to juniors and seniors (11th and 12th grade)
- Prerequisites: Completion of any foundational courses required for your chosen college class
- Attendance: Strong attendance record with minimal unexcused absences
- Maturity: Demonstrated responsibility and self-motivation in your current courses
- Good standing: No major disciplinary issues or academic probations

**Approval Process:**
1. **Initial consultation:** Meet with your Excel High School guidance counsellor to discuss your interest in concurrent enrolment and review your eligibility.

2. **Research options:** Explore available college courses that align with your academic interests and career goals.

3. **Application:** Complete the Excel High School Concurrent Enrolment Application form, including:
   - Your academic history
   - The college course(s) you wish to take
   - A brief statement explaining why you want to pursue concurrent enrolment
   - How the course fits into your educational plans

4. **Parental/guardian consent:** Obtain signed permission from your parent or guardian.

5. **Review process:** Your application will be evaluated by the Concurrent Enrolment Committee.

6. **Decision notification:** You'll receive written notification of approval or denial.

7. **College application:** If approved by Excel High School, you'll then apply to the college offering the course, following their concurrent enrolment procedures.

8. **Enrolment confirmation:** Once accepted by both institutions, you'll finalise your registration and obtain any necessary materials.

Following this process carefully will boost your chances of approval and help set you up for success in your concurrent enrolment experience.

### Core Concept 3: Scenario Example

Let's follow Maya, a junior at Excel High School with a 3.7 GPA, as she navigates the concurrent enrolment process:

**Step 1:** Maya meets with her guidance counsellor, Ms. Rodriguez, to discuss her interest in taking an introductory biology course at the local community college. Ms. Rodriguez confirms Maya meets the eligibility requirements and explains the next steps.

**Step 2:** Maya researches the biology course at the community college, confirming it fits her schedule and aligns with her goal of pursuing pre-med studies after high school.

**Step 3:** Maya completes the Concurrent Enrolment Application, explaining how the college biology course will provide lab experience not available in her high school curriculum and help prepare her for future pre-med coursework.

**Step 4:** Maya's parents sign the consent form, acknowledging they understand the additional workload and responsibilities.

**Step 5:** The Concurrent Enrolment Committee reviews Maya's application and approves her request based on her strong academic record and clear connection to her career goals.

**Step 6:** Maya applies to the community college's concurrent enrolment programme, submitting her high school transcript and Excel High School's approval letter.

**Step 7:** Once accepted, Maya purchases her textbooks and lab materials, and works with Ms. Rodriguez to make sure her high school schedule accommodates her college class times.

Throughout the semester, Maya keeps in touch with both her high school counsellor and college professor, making sure she stays on track in all her courses.
