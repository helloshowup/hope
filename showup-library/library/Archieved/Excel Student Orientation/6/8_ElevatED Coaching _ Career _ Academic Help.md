### Core Concept 1: Overview of Academic Coaching and Career Exploration Tools

Feeling a bit lost about your future? You're not alone. That's exactly why Excel High School offers personalised support through academic coaching and career exploration tools. Your Success Coach is your go-to person throughout high school, providing guidance that's tailored to your specific needs and goals.

Your Success Coach will:

- Guide you through career exploration

The career exploration tools at your fingertips include:

- Resources connecting your current coursework to future careers

These tools create a bridge between what you're studying now and what you might want to do later, giving your high school journey real purpose and direction.

### Core Concept 2: Accessing and Utilising Peterson's Career & Test Prep

Peterson's Career & Test Prep can help you discover potential career paths that match your interests and strengths. Here's how to get started:

**Accessing Peterson's:**
1. Log in to your Excel High School student portal
2. Click on the "Resources" tab
3. Select "Peterson's Career & Test Prep"
4. Use your Excel High School credentials to log in

**Completing an Interest Inventory:**
1. Once logged in, find the "Career Planning" or "Assessments" section
2. Select the "Interest Inventory" or "Career Interest Profiler"
3. Answer questions honestly about activities you enjoy
4. Review your results showing career clusters matching your interests

Your results will highlight career fields that align with what you like doing. For instance, if your results show a strong interest in health science, you might want to look into careers like nursing, physical therapy, or medical technology.

Remember, these results aren't meant to box you in â€“ they're just starting points that might introduce you to options you hadn't considered before.

### Core Concept 3: Setting Academic and Career-Related Goals

Clear goals can keep you motivated throughout high school. The SMART framework helps create goals that actually work:

**SMART Goals are:**
- **S**pecific: Clear and focused
- **M**easurable: Include ways to track progress
- **A**chievable: Realistic for your situation
- **R**elevant: Connected to your bigger picture
- **T**ime-bound: Have a deadline

**Example of an Academic SMART Goal:**
"I will improve my Biology grade from a C to a B by the end of this term by completing all homework, creating study guides for each unit, and attending online tutoring twice a month."

**Example of a Career-Related SMART Goal:**
"Within the next two months, I'll research three careers in technology that matched my interest inventory by interviewing one professional in each field and writing a one-page summary of each career path."

Your Success Coach can help refine your goals and develop strategies to achieve them. As you progress, you'll regularly review and adjust your goals to reflect your growing knowledge and changing interests.

### Over to You:

1. After completing the interest inventory on Peterson's platform, which career cluster aligned most closely with your interests? Was this expected or surprising to you? Explain why.

2. Think about your current academic performance. What's one specific area where you'd like to improve? Write a SMART academic goal related to this area.

3. Based on your interest inventory results, what's one career you'd like to learn more about? What specific steps could you take in the next month to explore this career option?
