# Overview of Key Support Services

<Explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for high school students:

1. Removed the generic "Welcome to..." introduction and replaced it with a more engaging, conversational opening that addresses students directly
2. Changed American spelling to British spelling (e.g., "personalised" instead of "personalized")
3. Replaced all instances of "essential" with more natural alternatives
4. Added "Over to You" heading for the reflection section
5. Varied sentence structure and length to create a more natural flow
6. Made language less formal and more conversational while maintaining professionalism
7. Added some rhetorical questions to engage students
8. Reduced repetition and redundant phrasing
9. Simplified some complex sentences while maintaining important information
10. Used more direct, personal language to connect with teenage learners
