  "final_content": "<Analysis>\nI've identified several AI patterns in this text that need to be addressed:\n1. The formal \"Welcome to...\" introduction that lacks personality\n2. Overuse of words like \"essential\" and \"crucial\"\n3. American spelling that needs to be converted to British spelling\n4. Missing \"Over to You\" heading for the reflection section\n5. Overall tone is somewhat robotic and lacks the natural flow of human writing\n6. Content is information-heavy without enough connection to the student experience\n\nMy approach to humanizing this text:\n- Replace the generic introduction with something more engaging and personal\n- Vary sentence structures and use more natural transitions\n- Convert American to British spelling (e.g., \"personalized\" to \"personalised\")\n- Add the \"Over to You\" heading as requested\n- Replace \"essential\" with more varied, natural alternatives\n- Make the content more relatable to high school students\n- Maintain professionalism while adding warmth\n</Analysis>\n\n<Edited Text>\n## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION\n\n**Module Number:** Module 1, Lesson 3\n\n**Lesson Title:** Overview of Key Support Services at Excel High School\n\n## LEARNING COMPONENTS\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\n- Explain the relationship between Excel High School's policies, support actions, and student outcomes\n- Identify the key support services available to Excel High School students\n- Describe how support services contribute to student success\n\n### Core Concept 1: The Support Services Flow\n\nAt Excel High School, the support system follows a clear path: from policy to action to outcome. This approach ensures you receive the assistance you need when you need it:\n\n1. **Policy**: These are the guidelines and rules set by Excel High School to create a supportive learning environment. For example, the \"Student Success Policy\" establishes that every student deserves personalised support.\n\n2. **Action**: Based on these policies, support teams take specific actions. This might include offering one-on-one tutoring sessions, providing technical assistance, or connecting you with a success coach.\n\n3. **Outcome**: The ultimate goal is to produce positive outcomes for you. This could mean improved grades, increased confidence, or better preparation for college and career.\n\n[INFOGRAPHIC: A flow chart showing the progression from \"Policy\" (e.g., \"Academic Support Policy\") \u2192 \"Action\" (e.g., \"Personalised Tutoring Sessions\") \u2192 \"Outcome\" (e.g., \"Improved Grades and Confidence\").
