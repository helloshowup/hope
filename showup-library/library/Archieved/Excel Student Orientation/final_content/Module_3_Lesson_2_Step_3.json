This quick quiz will help you figure out which option might work better for your life right now. Be honest with yourself as you answer each question.\n\n### Question 1: How many hours per week can you realistically dedicate to schoolwork?\n- A. 25+ hours per week\n- B. 15-24 hours per week\n- C. 10-14 hours per week\n- D. Less than 10 hours per week\n\n### Question 2: What is your primary goal for attending Excel High School?\n- A. Complete my diploma as quickly as possible\n- B. Balance education with other significant commitments\n- C. Take a few courses while focusing primarily on other responsibilities\n- D. Explore academic interests at my own pace\n\n### Question 3: Which best describes your current work situation?\n- A. I don't work or work very minimal hours\n- B. I work part-time (less than 30 hours per week)\n- C. I work full-time (30+ hours per week)\n- D. I have variable work hours that change frequently\n\n### Question 4: Do you have significant family or caregiving responsibilities?\n- A. No, I have minimal family responsibilities\n- B. Some, but they're manageable with planning\n- C. Yes, I have substantial family commitments\n- D. My family responsibilities vary significantly week to week\n\n### Question 5: How would you describe your preferred learning pace?\n- A. I prefer to immerse myself completely and progress quickly\n- B. I like a steady, consistent pace with regular progress\n- C. I need flexibility to adjust my pace based on other commitments\n- D. I prefer to take my time and not feel rushed\n\n## Your Results\n\n**Mostly A's: Full-Time Enrolment Recommended**\nYou seem to have the time and circumstances that work well with full-time study. With 25+ hours available weekly and fewer competing responsibilities, you can make steady progress through your courses. Full-time students typically complete 5-6 credits per semester, helping you graduate sooner. This option may also qualify you for certain financial aid programmes that require full-time status.\n\n**Mostly B's: Full-Time Enrolment Possible, But Consider Your Limits**\nYou could manage as a full-time student, but you'll need solid time management skills. Your other commitments are significant but workable. Consider starting full-time but be ready to adjust if things get overwhelming. Excel High School offers flexibility if you need to change your status later.\n\n**Mostly C's: Part-Time Enrolment Recommended**\nYour current life suggests that part-time study would be more sustainable. With significant work or family commitments, the reduced course load (typically 2-4 credits per semester) will help you balance education with other responsibilities. This approach may take longer to complete your diploma, but it sets you up for success by matching your academic load to your available time.\n\n**Mostly D's: Part-Time Enrolment with Reduced Course Load Recommended**\nYour changing schedule and commitments point to a highly flexible, reduced course load as your best option. Starting with just 1-2 courses will help you establish good study habits while managing your varying responsibilities. Excel High School gives you up to 12 months per course, providing the flexibility you need. You can always take more courses later as you settle into a routine.\n\n**Mixed Results:**\nIf your answers were all over the place, consider starting part-time to establish your academic routine. You can always increase to full-time later if you find you have more capacity than you thought. Success often comes from setting realistic expectations rather than taking on too much at the start.\n\n## Key Points to Consider\n\n**For Full-Time Students:**\n- Plan to spend 25+ hours weekly on coursework\n- Complete approximately 5-6 credits per semester\n- May qualify for more financial aid options\n- Can potentially graduate more quickly (12-18 months)\n- Requires good time management skills\n\n**For Part-Time Students:**\n- More flexibility to balance school with work/family\n- Can take fewer courses at once (minimum of 1 course)\n- Typically complete 2-4 credits per semester\n- Longer overall time to graduation\n- Often better for students with significant outside commitments\n\nRemember that at Excel High School, you can adjust your enrolment status if your life changes. The right choice is the one that works for your unique situation.\n\n## Over to You\n\nTake a moment to reflect on your quiz results. Do they match what you expected? Consider discussing your thoughts with family members who understand your daily commitments. What concerns do you have about your preferred enrolment option? Jot down any questions you'd like to ask an academic advisor.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBased on your results, book a chat with an Excel High School academic advisor to discuss your specific situation and create a study plan tailored to your needs and goals.",
