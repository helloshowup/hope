Whether it's for insurance discounts, your driving licence, or a part-time job, a Proof of Enrolment (POE) letter has you covered. Let's look at what makes you eligible, why there's a 30-day activity rule, and how to get your letter when you need it.\n\n## Active Full-Time Student Status and the 30-Day Rule\n\n### What Qualifies as an \"Active Full-Time Student\"?\n\nAt Excel High School, an active full-time student is defined by the following criteria:\n\n1. You must be **currently enrolled** in an Excel High School programme\n2. Your account must be in **good standing** (no outstanding financial obligations)\n3. You must have **logged into your courses** within the past 30 days\n4. You must have **submitted academic work** within the past 30 days\n\nThe 30-day activity requirement is particularly important. Simply being enrolled without active participation isn't enough to qualify for a POE letter.\n\n### Why the 30-Day Rule Matters\n\nThe 30-day rule exists for several practical reasons:\n\n- **Accuracy and integrity**: It helps Excel High School verify that you're genuinely participating in your education\n- **External requirements**: Many organisations (like insurance companies and government agencies) specifically want proof that you're actively studying\n- **Educational progress**: Regular engagement is key to success in an online learning environment\n\n**Example:**\nEmma needs a POE letter for her car insurance discount. She's been completing assignments and logging into her courses several times weekly. When she requests a POE letter, she easily qualifies under the 30-day rule. However, if Emma had taken a two-month break without logging in, she'd need to jump back into her coursework before becoming eligible for a POE letter.\n\n## How to Request a Proof of Enrolment Letter\n\nGetting your Proof of Enrolment letter is straightforward through the LearnStage Help Desk. Here's what to do:\n\n1. **Log in to your LearnStage account** and make sure you've been active within the past 30 days\n2. **Navigate to the Help Desk** by clicking on the \"Help\" or \"Support\" option in your dashboard\n3. **Create a new support ticket** by selecting \"New Ticket\" or \"Create Request\"\n4. **Select \"Proof of Enrolment Request\"** from the category dropdown menu\n5. **In your request, include**:\n   - Your full legal name as it should appear on the letter\n   - Your student ID number\n   - The purpose of the letter (insurance, driving licence, etc.)\n   - Any specific information that needs to be included\n   - Where the letter should be sent (your email or a third party's email/address)\n   - Any deadline by which you need the letter\n6. **Submit your ticket** and wait for confirmation\n\n### Processing Time and Delivery\n\nOnce submitted, Proof of Enrolment requests are typically processed within 1-2 business days. The letter will be delivered according to your specifications, either:\n\n- Emailed directly to you as a PDF attachment\n- Emailed to a third party you've specified\n- Attached to your support ticket for future reference\n\n**Important Note:** If you need your POE letter sent directly to a third party (such as an insurance company), be sure to include the recipient's name, email address, and any reference numbers in your request.\n\n## Over to You\n\n1. Think about your own course activity patterns. Based on the 30-day rule, would you currently qualify for a Proof of Enrolment letter? What steps might you need to take to maintain eligibility?\n\n2.

If they have been enrolled for less than 30 days\n   - B. If they have not logged in or submitted work in their courses for more than 30 days\n   - C.
