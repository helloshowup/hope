Don't worry\u2014we've got your back. At Excel High School, we're committed to helping you succeed in our online environment. Let's walk through how to request and document the academic support you need to thrive.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Disclosure Process During Enrolment\n\nThe first step in receiving appropriate support is letting us know about your needs when you enrol. This early heads-up helps us prepare everything before you dive into your coursework.\n\nDuring online enrolment, you'll see a section asking about learning accommodations or support. Here's what to keep in mind:\n\n1. Be honest and thorough. The more we know, the better we can help.\n2. If you're on the fence about disclosing something, go ahead and share it. We can always adjust your support later.\n3. This information stays confidential and only goes to staff directly involved in your education.\n4. After you disclose your needs, our Registrar will reach out about next steps, including how to submit documentation.\n\nRemember, sharing your needs is completely your choice, but it's the most effective way to get the support you deserve under educational law.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Acceptable Documentation\n\nTo provide proper accommodations, we need official documentation of your learning needs. We accept:\n\n1. **Individualised Education Programme (IEP):** A document from your previous school detailing your specific learning needs and accommodations.\n\n2. **504 Plan:** A plan outlining accommodations that help you fully access the curriculum.\n\n3. **Professional Evaluation:** A recent assessment (typically within the last three years) from a qualified professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or learning specialist that details your diagnosis and recommended accommodations.\n\nWhen submitting your paperwork:\n- Make sure it's current and complete\n- Include relevant medical information\n- Provide contact details for the professionals who evaluated you\n\nDon't have recent documentation? No problem. Contact our Registrar for guidance on getting an updated evaluation.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Review Timeline and Outcomes\n\nAfter submitting your documentation, here's what happens next:\n\n1. **Initial Review (5-7 business days):** Our support team will confirm they received your documents and make sure everything needed is there.\n\n2. **Follow-up:** If we need more information, we'll get in touch during this time.\n\n3. **Decision (10-14 business days total):** Based on our review, we'll create a personalised support plan just for you.\n\nPossible outcomes include:\n- Full accommodation approval\n- Partial approval with suggestions for additional support\n- Request for more information or updated documentation\n- Denial (rare cases where needs can't be met in our online setup)\n\nWe'll keep you posted via email throughout this process. Haven't heard from us when expected? Don't hesitate to ping the Registrar.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your own learning style. What types of support or accommodations have helped you succeed in the past?\n\n2. How might requesting support at an online school differ from doing so at a traditional brick-and-mortar school?\n\n3. Why is it important to be proactive about sharing your support needs when enrolling at Excel High School?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following is NOT considered acceptable documentation for requesting support at Excel High School?\n   A. A current IEP from your previous school\n   B. A note from a parent describing your needs\n   C. A 504 Plan\n   D. A recent professional evaluation\n\n2. How long does the initial review of support documentation typically take?\n   A. 1-2 business days\n   B. 5-7 business days\n   C. 2-3 weeks\n   D. 1 month\n\n3. Who should you contact first if you have questions about the support request process?\n   A. Your teachers\n   B. The school principal\n   C. The Registrar\n   D. Other students\n\n### Summary\n\nRequesting and documenting support at Excel High School follows a straightforward process designed to help you get the accommodations you need for academic success. Remember to share your needs during enrolment, provide current documentation, and stay in touch throughout the review process. If you have questions, reach out to the Registrar, your Success Coach, or our Help Desk.
