As a student, knowing our harassment and bullying policies helps protect both you and your classmates. These guidelines exist so everyone can focus on their studies without worrying about mistreatment.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll look at what counts as harassment and bullying, how to report incidents, what happens during an investigation, and the consequences for those who break these rules. This knowledge puts you in a better position to spot inappropriate behaviour and take action if needed.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Defining Key Terms\n\nTo properly address harassment and bullying, you need to know what these behaviours actually look like:\n\n**Sexual Harassment:** This includes unwelcome sexual advances, inappropriate comments about someone's body, sharing explicit images, or making sexual jokes that make others uncomfortable. For instance, repeatedly asking someone for a date after they've said no or making comments about their appearance that cross boundaries.\n\n**Racial Harassment:** This involves targeting someone based on their race, colour, or national origin. Examples include using racial slurs, making stereotypical comments, or excluding someone from activities because of their race or ethnicity.\n\n**Religious Harassment:** This means mistreating someone because of their religious beliefs or practices. This could include mocking religious clothing or symbols, making fun of religious holidays, or pressuring someone to violate their religious principles.\n\n**Chronic Harassment:** This refers to a pattern of repeated offensive behaviour that continues over time. The ongoing nature is what makes it particularly harmful to the person being targeted.\n\n**Bullying** often overlaps with these forms of harassment but specifically involves an imbalance of power where someone repeatedly and intentionally causes another person harm or discomfort. This can happen face-to-face or online (cyberbullying) through social media, text messages, or other digital platforms.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Reporting an Incident\n\nIf you experience or witness harassment or bullying at Excel High School, here's what to do:\n\n1. **Document the incident:** Write down exactly what happened, including:\n   - Date, time, and location\n   - Who was involved\n   - What was said or done\n   - Names of any witnesses\n   - Screenshots or copies of digital evidence (for cyberbullying)\n\n2. **Report to a trusted adult:** You can talk to:\n   - A teacher you trust\n   - Your counsellor\n   - Any school administrator\n   - Use the anonymous reporting form on the school's website if you're uncomfortable reporting in person\n\n3. **Provide details:** Share your documentation and any evidence you've collected. Be as specific as possible about what happened.\n\n4. **Seek support:** Our counselling staff is always available to help you process your feelings and provide emotional support throughout this process.\n\nRemember, reporting harassment or bullying isn't \"snitching\" \u2013 it's taking responsible action to keep everyone safe. Many students worry about speaking up, but Excel High School takes steps to protect your privacy during this process.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Investigation Process and Retaliation Policy\n\nWhen you report an incident, here's what happens behind the scenes:\n\n1. **Initial review:** A designated administrator reviews your report within 24 hours to determine next steps.\n\n2. **Investigation:** The school will:\n   - Interview you and any witnesses\n   - Talk to the person accused of harassment or bullying\n   - Review any evidence (messages, social media posts, etc.)\n   - Consult with other staff members as needed\n\n3. **Determination:** Based on all the information gathered, the school decides if a policy violation occurred.\n\n4. **Communication:** You'll be informed about the outcome of the investigation while respecting everyone's privacy rights.\n\n**Excel High School's Non-Retaliation Policy:**\n\nExcel High School strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports harassment or bullying or participates in an investigation. This means:\n\n- No one is allowed to \"get back at\" you for making a report\n- No one can threaten, intimidate, or mistreat you for speaking up\n- Any retaliation is treated as a separate policy violation with its own consequences\n\nThis protection means you can report incidents without worrying about making things worse for yourself.\n\n### Core Concept 4: Consequences for Policy Violations\n\nExcel High School uses a progressive discipline approach, which means consequences typically start smaller for first-time or minor offences and become more serious for repeated or severe violations:\n\n1. **Warnings:** For minor first-time offences, students may receive a verbal or written warning explaining why their behaviour violated school policy.\n\n2. **Probation:** Students may be placed on probation, requiring improved behaviour and regular check-ins with counsellors or administrators.\n\n3. **Removal:** Temporary removal from specific classes or activities where the problematic behaviour occurred to separate the involved parties.\n\n4. **Suspension:** Short-term removal from school for more serious or repeated violations.\n\n5. **Expulsion:** In severe cases or after multiple interventions have failed, a student may be permanently removed from Excel High School.\n\nThe specific consequence depends on:\n- The severity of the incident\n- Any history of previous misconduct\n- The impact on the targeted person\n- Other relevant factors\n\nThe goal is always to correct behaviour, keep everyone safe, and maintain a positive learning environment\u2014not simply to punish.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about a time when you witnessed or experienced disrespectful behaviour (in any setting). How did it make you feel, and what actions did you or others take in response?\n\n2. Why do you think it's important for schools to have clear policies on harassment and bullying? How might these policies benefit both potential victims and potential offenders?\n\n3. What might be some reasons a student might hesitate to report an incident? How would you encourage a friend to report if they were experiencing harassment or bullying?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following is NOT considered a form of harassment according to Excel High School's policy?\n   A. Racial slurs\n   B. Unwanted sexual advances\n   C. Friendly disagreements\n   D. Mocking religious practices\n\n2. What is the first step you should take if you witness bullying at Excel High School?\n   A. Confront the bully directly\n   B. Document the incident\n   C. Post about it on social media\n   D. Ignore it and hope it stops\n\n3. What is Excel High School's policy on retaliation against someone who reports harassment?\n   A. It's allowed if the report turns out to be false\n   B. It's permitted for minor incidents only\n   C. It's treated as a separate policy violation\n   D. It's encouraged to prevent false reports\n\n### Summary\n\nUnderstanding Excel High School's harassment and bullying policies matters for maintaining a safe and respectful learning environment.
