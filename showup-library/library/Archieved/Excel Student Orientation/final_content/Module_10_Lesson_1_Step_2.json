Note one action you'll take this week to practise it.**\n\nTake a few minutes to think about your digital skills. Knowing what to improve now will help you feel more confident in your courses.\n\nFor example:\n- *\"I'm least comfortable with organising files. This week, I'll create a folder system for my courses and practise saving documents with clear names.\"*\n- *\"I need to improve my email skills. I'll practise writing three professional emails using proper formatting and checking for clarity before sending.\"*\n- *\"Search techniques are challenging for me. I'll spend 20 minutes trying different search operators to find specific information for my upcoming assignments.\"*\n\nThe more you use these skills, the more natural they'll become. Plus, these digital abilities will serve you well beyond school\u2014they're valuable for university and future jobs too.\n\n**Your Reflection:**\n[Space for student response]\n\nIf you're struggling with any skills, try spending 15-30 minutes each day this week working on that specific area. Short, regular practise sessions work better than one marathon session. And remember, your academic advisor is just a message away in your student portal if you need help.",
  "editing_explanation": "I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for high school students:\n\n1. Removed the generic \"Welcome to...\" introduction and replaced it with a more engaging, conversational opening that acknowledges students' varying comfort levels with technology\n2. Changed American spelling to British spelling (e.g., \"organise\" instead of \"organize\")\n3. Replaced all instances of \"essential\" with more natural alternatives\n4. Added \"Over to You\" heading for the reflection section\n5. Varied sentence structure and length to create a more natural flow\n6. Made language more conversational while maintaining professionalism\n7. Added some relatable elements that speak directly to teenage students\n8. Simplified some explanations while maintaining clarity\n9. Adjusted tone to be encouraging rather than prescriptive",
