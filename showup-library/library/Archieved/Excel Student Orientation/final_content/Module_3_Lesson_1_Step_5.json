  "final_content": "<Analysis>\nI've identified several AI patterns in this text that need addressing:\n\n1. Overly formal tone and academic language that may not engage high school students\n2. Generic \"Welcome to\" style introduction that lacks personality\n3. Repetitive structure and predictable formatting\n4. Overuse of bullet points and technical language\n5. Use of the word \"essential\" which needs replacement\n6. American spelling that needs conversion to British spelling\n7. Lack of conversational elements that would make the content more relatable\n\nMy edits focus on:\n- Creating a more conversational, approachable tone while maintaining professionalism\n- Adding more natural transitions and varied sentence structures\n- Converting American to British spelling (e.g., \"recognized\" to \"recognised\")\n- Replacing \"essential\" with more natural alternatives\n- Adding the \"Over to You\" heading for reflection practices\n- Making the content more engaging for 14-18 year old students\n- Simplifying complex information without losing important details\n</Analysis>\n\n<Edited_Text>\n# Transfer & Homeschool Credits\n\nBringing credits from your previous school or homeschool programme? We've got you covered. This guide walks you through how Excel High School evaluates and accepts qualifying credits, helping you map out your path to graduation without repeating coursework you've already mastered.\n\n## Accepted Credit Sources\n\nExcel High School accepts credits from several different sources that meet our academic standards:\n\n### Regionally Accredited U.S. Schools\nCredits earned at regionally accredited schools throughout the United States are generally accepted. These include:\n- Public high schools\n- Private high schools with regional accreditation\n- Accredited online schools\n- Community colleges or universities (for dual enrolment credits)\n\n### Qualified Homeschool Programmes\nExcel High School recognises homeschool credits when properly documented. Acceptable homeschool documentation includes:\n- Detailed homeschool transcripts showing:\n  - Course names\n  - Letter grades or percentages\n  - Credits earned\n  - Completion dates\n- Course descriptions and curriculum information\n- Documentation of instructional hours (75+ hours typically equals one credit)\n- Portfolios of student work (when applicable)\n\n### International Transcripts\nStudents with academic records from outside the United States can have their credits evaluated through:\n- Professional credential evaluation services (such as World Education Services or Educational Credential Evaluators)\n- Translation of non-English transcripts by certified translators\n- Verification of equivalency to U.S. educational standards\n\n## How to Submit Your Transcripts\n\nFollow these steps to have your previous credits evaluated and applied toward your Excel High School diploma:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Your Documentation\nCollect all official transcripts and supporting documentation from your previous schools or homeschool programme. Make sure they include:\n- Complete course names\n- Final grades\n- Credits earned\n- Dates of completion\n\n### Step 2: Submit Official Transcripts\nOfficial transcripts must be sent directly from your previous school(s) to Excel High School using one of these methods:\n\n**Electronic Submission (Preferred)**\n- Have your previous school send electronic transcripts to: records@excelhighschool.com\n- Electronic transcripts must come directly from the issuing institution or through an official transcript service\n\n**Mail Submission**\n- Official paper transcripts should be mailed to:\n  Excel High School\n  Attn: Records Department\n  33499 6th Street NE\n  Waltham, MN 55082\n\n**Homeschool Documentation**\n- Submit your homeschool portfolio and documentation through your student portal or email to homeschool@excelhighschool.com\n\n### Step 3: Complete the Credit Transfer Request Form\n- Log in to your Excel High School student portal\n- Go to the \"Academic Records\" section\n- Complete the \"Credit Transfer Request Form\"\n- Submit the form electronically\n\n### Step 4: Credit Evaluation Timeline\n- Initial review begins within 5-7 business days of receiving all required documentation\n- Complete evaluation typically takes 7-10 business days\n- You'll receive an email notification when your evaluation is complete\n- Your academic advisor will schedule a meeting to discuss your updated graduation plan\n\n## Understanding Your Credit Evaluation\n\nAfter evaluation, you'll receive a detailed credit transfer report showing:\n- Courses accepted for transfer\n- Equivalent Excel High School courses\n- Credits applied toward your diploma requirements\n- Remaining credits needed for graduation\n\nImportant considerations for your transfer credits:\n- Maximum transferable credits: Up to 18 credits (75% of graduation requirements)\n- Minimum grade requirement: C or better (70%)\n- Graduation requirement: Final 25% of credits (minimum 6 credits) must be completed through Excel High School\n- Not all credits may transfer due to curriculum alignment or documentation issues\n\n> **Helpful Tips:**\n> For complete details on our transfer policies, visit:\n> - [Credit Transfer Policy](https://www.excelhighschool.com/credit-transfer-policy)\n> - [Homeschool Credit Acceptance Guidelines](https://www.excelhighschool.com/homeschool-credits)\n> - [International Transcript Evaluation Process](https://www.excelhighschool.com/international-credits)\n>\n> Submit your transcripts as early as possible to avoid delays in your graduation timeline.

Review your updated graduation plan with your academic advisor\n2. Register for remaining required courses\n3. Create a timeline for completing your Excel High School diploma\n\nGetting your transfer credits sorted early helps you build a realistic graduation timeline and prevents you from having to retake courses you've already passed.\n\n## Over to You\n\nTake a moment to gather information about your previous academic work.
