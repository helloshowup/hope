Starting this process at least 6-8 weeks before the college semester begins will give you enough time to complete all requirements.\n\nIf you have questions at any point, don't hesitate to reach out to our academic counselling team through the Help Desk. We're here to help you navigate this exciting educational opportunity!\n\n## Over to You\n\nTake a moment to reflect on your readiness for dual enrolment.

Removed the generic \"Congratulations\" introduction and replaced it with a more direct, practical opening\n2. Changed American spelling to British (e.g., \"programme\" instead of \"program\")\n3. Replaced \"essential\" with more natural alternatives like \"important\" and \"necessary\"\n4. Added \"Over to You\" reflection section that was missing\n5. Varied sentence structures and reduced repetitive phrasing\n6. Made language less formal and more conversational while maintaining professionalism\n7. Simplified some complex instructions into more digestible chunks\n8. Added more personal touches that speak directly to the student\n9. Improved flow between sections with better transitions",
