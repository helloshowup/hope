As an online student at Excel High School, you have flexibility in when and where you complete your coursework, but keeping your school informed about your availability remains important. This lesson explores why notifying the school before planned absences matters and provides you with a practical commitment checklist to help you develop this valuable habit. Good communication practices now will build a foundation for success throughout your educational journey and develop skills you'll use in college and your future career.\n\n### Understanding Planned Absences in an Online Environment\n\nThe flexibility of online learning at Excel High School means you can study from anywhere at any time, but there may still be periods when you cannot engage with your coursework at all. A planned absence is any period when you know in advance that you'll be unable to log in, complete assignments, or participate in required activities.\n\nExamples of planned absences include:\n- Family holidays or travel\n- Medical procedures or appointments\n- Religious or cultural observances\n- Significant family events\n- Extended periods without internet access\n- Work-related commitments (for working students)\n\nEven in an asynchronous learning environment, extended periods without academic engagement can impact your progress and may affect your ability to complete courses within expected timeframes. Additionally, if instructors or staff are expecting to hear from you\u2014perhaps regarding feedback on an assignment or participation in a scheduled check-in\u2014knowing about your absence in advance helps them adjust their expectations and support accordingly.\n\n### Benefits of Advance Notification\n\nNotifying Excel High School before a planned absence is more than just ticking a box\u2014it's a key part of your academic success strategy. When you inform the school about upcoming absences, you enable your instructors to provide appropriate accommodations, adjust deadlines if necessary, and ensure you don't miss important learning opportunities.\n\nThis proactive communication offers several meaningful benefits:\n\n**Maintains Academic Momentum:** When the school knows about your absence, your instructors can help you plan around it, perhaps by adjusting due dates or providing materials in advance so you can stay on track.\n\n**Demonstrates Responsibility:** Taking the initiative to communicate about absences shows maturity and commitment to your education\u2014qualities that will serve you well beyond high school.\n\n**Prevents Misunderstandings:** Without proper notification, extended periods of inactivity might be misinterpreted as disengagement or lack of effort, potentially affecting your standing in the course.\n\n**Keeps You in Good Standing:** Excel High School has specific policies regarding attendance and engagement. Proper notification helps ensure you remain in good standing with these policies.\n\n**Facilitates Support:** When the school knows about your absence in advance, they can better support your return and help you quickly reintegrate into your studies.\n\n### The Absence Notification Commitment\n\nCreating a personal system for tracking and communicating planned absences will help you maintain consistent communication with Excel High School. Use this checklist to solidify your commitment to proper absence notification:\n\n**Absence Notification Commitment Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] I will review my calendar at the beginning of each month to identify any upcoming planned absences.\n- [ ] I will notify Excel High School at least one week before a short absence (1-3 days).\n- [ ] I will notify Excel High School at least two weeks before an extended absence (4+ days).\n- [ ] My notification will include:\n  * My full name and student ID number\n  * Specific dates of absence (first and last day)\n  * Brief explanation (while keeping personal details private)\n  * My plan for managing coursework during this time\n- [ ] I will email my academic advisor and copy my course instructors.\n- [ ] I will contact my instructor(s) directly for absences that might affect specific course deadlines.\n- [ ] If an emergency absence occurs, I will notify the school as soon as reasonably possible.\n- [ ] I will look for responses to my absence notifications and follow any additional guidance provided.\n- [ ] I will update the school if my absence plans change (extended or shortened duration).\n- [ ] I understand that consistent communication about attendance demonstrates my commitment to academic success.\n\nConsider printing this checklist and keeping it visible in your study area as a regular reminder of this important responsibility.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1.
