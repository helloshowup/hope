A grandfather clause allows existing students to continue following the rules that were in place when they first enrolled, even after new policies have been introduced. Think of it as being \"protected\" from certain changes that happen after you've started your educational journey at Excel High School.\n\n**Why Does This Matter to You?**  \nAs a student at Excel High School, grandfather clauses directly impact your graduation requirements and academic experience. Understanding these policies helps you:\n- Know exactly what you need to graduate\n- Plan your courses with confidence\n- Avoid confusion when school policies change\n\n**How Grandfather Clauses Work at Excel High School:**\n\n1. **Graduation Requirements**  \n   If you enrolled before August 2023, you'll follow the graduation requirements that were in place when you started. For example:\n   - If you enrolled in 2021, you need 21 total credits to graduate\n   - If you enrolled in 2023, you need 24 total credits to graduate\n   - Both students can still earn the same diploma!\n\n2. **Course Requirements**  \n   When Excel High School updates which specific courses are required:\n   - You follow the course list from when you enrolled\n   - Your transcript and graduation plan reflect your specific requirements\n   - Your academic advisor can help you understand your personal requirements\n\n3. **Tuition and Fees**  \n   If you enrolled under a specific tuition plan, you'll generally continue with that plan as long as you remain continuously enrolled.\n\n**Real-Life Example:**  \nIn 2022, Excel High School updated its maths requirements to include statistics. Students who enrolled before this change can still follow their original maths sequence, while new students must follow the updated requirements.\n\n**Your Responsibilities:**\n- Keep track of your specific graduation requirements\n- Maintain continuous enrolment to preserve your grandfather status\n- Consult with your academic advisor if you're unsure about which policies apply to you\n\n**When Grandfather Clauses Don't Apply:**\n- School-wide technology updates\n- Changes required by law or accreditation\n- Behavioural policies and student conduct expectations\n\n**Have Questions?**  \nIf you're ever confused about which policies apply to you:\n1. Check your student portal for your personalised graduation requirements\n2. Contact your academic advisor for clarification\n3. Email the registrar's office with specific questions about your status\n\nUnderstanding grandfather clauses will help you navigate your high school experience successfully. These policies give you the stability to progress toward graduation with confidence, even as Excel High School continues to improve its programmes for future students.\n\n### Over to You\n\nTake a moment to reflect on how grandfather clauses might affect your own educational journey. Which graduation requirements apply to you based on when you enrolled? How might this impact your course planning? Jot down any questions you have about your specific situation to discuss with your academic advisor.",
