You'll need to know exactly how many will count toward your Excel diploma. This lesson breaks down the transfer credit policies you need to understand to map out your path to graduation. We'll cover the limits on transferable credits and how many courses you'll need to complete with Excel High School. Getting clear on these rules now will help you create a realistic timeline and avoid unexpected requirements later on.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Maximum Transfer Credit Allowance\n\nExcel High School allows you to transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for your diploma. This policy recognises your previous academic work while ensuring you complete enough coursework with Excel High School to earn a diploma.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice:\n- If your diploma programme requires 24 credits, you can transfer a maximum of 18 credits\n- If your diploma programme requires 21.5 credits, you can transfer a maximum of 16.125 credits\n\nThis 75% limit applies to all previously earned credits, including those from:\n- Public or private high schools\n- Other online schools\n- Homeschool programmes (with proper documentation)\n- Approved correspondence courses\n\nEven if you've completed more than 75% of your high school credits elsewhere, you'll still need to meet the residency requirement to earn an Excel High School diploma.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Diploma Residency Requirement\n\nThe residency requirement is the flip side of the transfer limit. To earn an Excel High School diploma, you must complete a minimum of 5.5 to 6 credits directly through Excel High School, depending on your specific programme.\n\nThis means:\n- You must complete approximately 25% of your total diploma requirements at Excel High School\n- For a 24-credit diploma programme, you'll need to earn at least 6 credits with Excel High School\n- For a 21.5-credit diploma programme, you'll need to earn at least 5.5 credits with Excel High School\n\nThe residency requirement maintains the integrity and value of your diploma by ensuring that every graduate has demonstrated proficiency in our curriculum and has been fully assessed according to Excel High School's academic standards.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Planning Your Academic Path\n\nNow that you understand these policies, you can effectively plan your academic journey:\n\n1. **Get your credits evaluated**: Submit all your previous transcripts as soon as possible after enrolment so the academic team can determine which credits will transfer.\n\n2. **Do the math**: Once you know your transferable credits, calculate how many more you need to complete. Remember that you must earn at least 5.5-6 credits at Excel High School, regardless of how many transfer credits you have.\n\n3. **Create a timeline**: Based on your remaining requirements, develop a realistic schedule for completing your diploma. Think about how many courses you can handle at once given your other commitments.\n\n4. **Meet with your advisor**: Your academic advisor can help you understand how these policies apply to your specific situation and help you create a personalised graduation plan.\n\nFor detailed information about these policies, please refer to the Residency Policy section in the Excel High School Student Handbook in your student portal.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. If you're pursuing a diploma that requires 22 total credits and you have 17 credits from your previous school, how many of those credits can transfer to Excel High School? How many credits will you need to complete at Excel High School?\n\n2. Why do you think Excel High School requires students to complete at least 25% of their credits directly through the school?
