# Why This Orientation Exists

# Why This Orientation Exists

Excel High School's Student Orientation serves as your roadmap to success in online learning. Just as you'd want to know where to find classrooms, the library, and counselling offices in a physical school, this orientation helps you navigate our virtual campus and prepare for your educational journey ahead.

## What is Student Orientation?

Student Orientation is a structured introduction to Excel High School's online learning environment, resources, and expectations. It provides you with the foundational knowledge, tools, and skills you'll need to thrive in an online educational setting.

Online learning offers remarkable flexibility that traditional schools simply can't match, but it also requires specific skills like digital literacy, self-motivation, and time management. This orientation bridges the gap between traditional and online learning by helping you develop these valuable skills. Research consistently shows that students who complete orientation programmes are significantly more likely to earn better grades, stay on track with assignments, and graduate on time.

## Time Commitment and Completion Tips

The entire orientation takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete, though this varies based on your learning pace and familiarity with online education. Since the orientation is self-paced, you can spread this time across several days or complete it in shorter sessions—whatever works best for your schedule.

**Tips for successful completion:**

* Schedule specific times to work on orientation sections
* Find a quiet, distraction-free environment
* Take notes on key concepts to reinforce learning
* Complete all activities and self-checks to ensure understanding
* Don't rush—the skills you're developing will help you throughout your studies
* Reach out to support staff if you encounter challenges or have questions

Remember that while you may be eager to begin your courses, the time invested in orientation will pay off throughout your academic journey at Excel High School.
