# Tuition Options by Program

<Analysis>
I've identified several AI patterns in this text that need humanizing:

1. The formal, detached introduction that starts with "Understanding the financial investment..."
2. Overuse of the word "program" and other repetitive terminology
3. Excessive use of bullet points and structured information without natural flow
4. Lack of direct address to the student reader in a relatable way
5. British spelling needed instead of American spelling
6. Need to replace "essential" with more natural alternatives
7. Need to add "Over to You" reflection sections
8. Overall tone is too formal and lacks the conversational quality that would engage high school students

My edits focus on creating a more conversational tone while maintaining professionalism, varying sentence structures, using more natural transitions, and making the content more directly relevant to teenage students considering Excel High School.
