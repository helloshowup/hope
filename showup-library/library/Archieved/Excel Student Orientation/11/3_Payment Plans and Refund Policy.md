# Payment Plans and Refund Policy

# Payment Plans and Refund Policy

Money matters can be confusing, but understanding how to pay for your studies at Excel High School is straightforward once you know your options. This lesson breaks down your payment choices, explains how automatic payments work, and covers what you need to know about refunds.

## Payment Plan Options

### Interest-Free Monthly Instalment Plans
Excel High School offers flexible, interest-free monthly instalment plans to make your education more affordable. These plans let you spread the cost of your programme over several months without paying extra.

Key features include:
- Equal monthly payments across your chosen payment term
- No interest charges or hidden fees
- Payment terms typically range from 3 to 12 months, depending on your programme
- Lower monthly payments with longer payment terms
- Automatic monthly billing to your designated payment method

### Full Payment Option
You can pay the entire tuition upfront if you prefer. This one-time payment covers the complete cost of your chosen programme.

Benefits include:
- Simpler billing with just one transaction
- No monthly payments to keep track of
- Often includes a discount compared to the total cost of instalment plans

**Important Note:** The full payment option isn't available for the adult high school diploma programme. Adult programme students must use the monthly instalment plan option.

## Automatic Payment Processing

### How Automatic Payments Work
When you enrol with a monthly instalment plan, you'll provide a credit or debit card that will be automatically charged according to your payment schedule. This system:
- Handles timely payments without you having to remember due dates
- Bills on the same date each month
- Provides electronic receipts for your records
- Keeps your access to courses uninterrupted

### What Happens If Payments Are Missed
It's important to have enough funds in your account for automatic payments. If payments can't be processed:
- You'll receive a notification about the failed payment
- A second attempt will be made to process the payment
- After three missed instalments, your account may be suspended, and you could lose access to your courses until payments are brought up to date
- You might need to pay reinstatement fees if your account is suspended due to missed payments

If you think you might struggle to make a payment, contact the billing department right away to discuss possible solutions.

## Refund Policy

### Credit-Transfer Guarantee
Excel High School stands behind the quality and transferability of our credits. Our Credit-Transfer Guarantee means that if an accredited institution doesn't accept our credits for transfer (subject to normal transfer credit policies), we'll refund your tuition.

### 10-Day Full Refund Window
Excel High School offers a 10-day satisfaction guarantee from the date of enrolment:
- You can request a full refund within 10 days of enrolment if you're not satisfied with our programme
- A 3% processing fee will be deducted from your refund amount to cover payment processing costs
- Refunds are issued to the original payment method you used for enrolment
- To request a refund, contact our student services department within the 10-day window

### No-Refund Policy After 10 Days
After the initial 10-day period has expired:
- No refunds will be issued for any reason
- This policy applies regardless of whether you've completed courses or your personal circumstances
- Monthly payments must continue until your tuition is paid in full, even if you decide to stop your studies

### Special Rules for State-Funded Programmes
If you're enrolled through a state-funded programme, different refund policies apply:
- Refund policies are determined by the specific state agency or funding programme
- You may need to provide documentation to process refunds for state-funded enrolments
- You should contact your state programme coordinator for specific refund guidelines
- Excel High School must follow state regulations regarding fund disbursement and returns

## Summary
Understanding Excel High School's payment plans and refund policy helps you manage your educational investment wisely. You can choose between interest-free monthly instalments or a full payment option (except for the adult programme). Automatic payments make billing convenient, but missing three payments may result in losing access to your courses. Remember that you have a 10-day window to request a refund (minus a 3% fee) if you're not satisfied, but no refunds are available after this period. State-funded programmes follow special refund rules set by the funding agency. Knowing these policies before you enrol helps you avoid financial surprises and focus on your education.
