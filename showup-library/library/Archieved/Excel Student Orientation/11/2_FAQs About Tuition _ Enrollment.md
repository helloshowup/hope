# FAQs About Tuition & Enrollment

# Frequently Asked Questions About Tuition & Enrolment

Choosing the right educational path involves many practical questions. We've gathered the most common queries about costs, enrolment processes, and programme options at Excel High School to help you navigate these important decisions with confidence.

## Top Five Tuition & Enrolment FAQs

### 1. Will colleges accept my Excel High School credits and diploma?

Yes! Excel High School is nationally accredited by Cognia and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA-CESS), which are recognised accrediting organisations. This means colleges, universities, employers, and the military accept our diplomas and transcripts. Our graduates have gone on to hundreds of colleges and universities across the country.

It's always smart to check with your specific colleges of interest about their credit acceptance policies, as admission requirements can vary from school to school.

### 2. Can I change programmes after I've enrolled?

Absolutely. Your educational needs might shift as you progress. You can upgrade or change your programme at any point during your enrolment. For instance, if you start with a single course but later decide to pursue a full diploma programme, or want to switch between diploma tracks, just contact our Student Services team.

We'll apply the tuition you've already paid toward your new programme—you'll only need to pay the difference if you're upgrading. Programme changes typically take 1-2 business days to process, so your learning continues with minimal disruption.

### 3. What payment options are available for tuition?

We offer several flexible payment options to fit different budgets:
- Full payment: Pay your entire tuition upfront for a discount
- Monthly payment plans: Break your tuition into manageable monthly instalments
- Quarterly payment plans: Make payments every three months
- Third-party financing: Options through partner financial institutions
- Discounts: Military, sibling, and financial need-based options may be available

We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and electronic checks. There are no hidden fees, and all course materials come included in your tuition.

### 4. How long will it take to complete my programme?

Completion time varies based on your situation:
- Full diploma programmes: Typically 1-2 years, depending on transfer credits and your pace
- Individual courses: Can be finished in as little as 4-8 weeks or extended up to 12 months
- Credit recovery: Often completed within 4-8 weeks per course

Our self-paced learning model lets you move quickly through material you grasp easily or take more time with challenging concepts. Without fixed semester dates or deadlines, you can create a schedule that works for your personal circumstances.

### 5. What if I need to take a break from my studies?

Life happens. When you need flexibility, Excel High School offers:
- Course extensions: Add 3, 6, or 12 months to your enrolment period
- Temporary holds: Pause your studies for up to 3-6 months due to personal circumstances, medical issues, or other significant life events
- Re-enrolment options: If your enrolment expires, you can re-enrol and maintain your academic progress

During a temporary hold, your account stays active, but your course completion timeline pauses. To request any of these options, contact Student Services before your enrolment period ends.
