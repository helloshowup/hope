# Requesting a Proof of Enrollment Letter

# Requesting a Proof of Enrolment Letter

Need to prove you're a student at Excel High School? Whether it's for insurance discounts, your driving licence, or a part-time job, a Proof of Enrolment (POE) letter has you covered. Let's look at what makes you eligible, why there's a 30-day activity rule, and how to get your letter when you need it.

## Active Full-Time Student Status and the 30-Day Rule

### What Qualifies as an "Active Full-Time Student"?

At Excel High School, an active full-time student is defined by the following criteria:

1. You must be **currently enrolled** in an Excel High School programme
2. Your account must be in **good standing** (no outstanding financial obligations)
3. You must have **logged into your courses** within the past 30 days
4. You must have **submitted academic work** within the past 30 days

The 30-day activity requirement is particularly important. Simply being enrolled without active participation isn't enough to qualify for a POE letter.

### Why the 30-Day Rule Matters

The 30-day rule exists for several practical reasons:

- **Accuracy and integrity**: It helps Excel High School verify that you're genuinely participating in your education
- **External requirements**: Many organisations (like insurance companies and government agencies) specifically want proof that you're actively studying
- **Educational progress**: Regular engagement is key to success in an online learning environment

**Example:**
Emma needs a POE letter for her car insurance discount. She's been completing assignments and logging into her courses several times weekly. When she requests a POE letter, she easily qualifies under the 30-day rule. However, if Emma had taken a two-month break without logging in, she'd need to jump back into her coursework before becoming eligible for a POE letter.

## How to Request a Proof of Enrolment Letter

Getting your Proof of Enrolment letter is straightforward through the LearnStage Help Desk. Here's what to do:

1. **Log in to your LearnStage account** and make sure you've been active within the past 30 days
2. **Navigate to the Help Desk** by clicking on the "Help" or "Support" option in your dashboard
3. **Create a new support ticket** by selecting "New Ticket" or "Create Request"
4. **Select "Proof of Enrolment Request"** from the category dropdown menu
5. **In your request, include**:
   - Your full legal name as it should appear on the letter
   - Your student ID number
   - The purpose of the letter (insurance, driving licence, etc.)
   - Any specific information that needs to be included
   - Where the letter should be sent (your email or a third party's email/address)
   - Any deadline by which you need the letter
6. **Submit your ticket** and wait for confirmation

### Processing Time and Delivery

Once submitted, Proof of Enrolment requests are typically processed within 1-2 business days. The letter will be delivered according to your specifications, either:

- Emailed directly to you as a PDF attachment
- Emailed to a third party you've specified
- Attached to your support ticket for future reference

**Important Note:** If you need your POE letter sent directly to a third party (such as an insurance company), be sure to include the recipient's name, email address, and any reference numbers in your request.
