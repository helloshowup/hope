# Extension Approval Criteria and Fees

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** Module 1, Lesson 4

**Lesson Title:** Understanding Course Extension Policies

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the criteria for course extension approval at Excel High School
- Identify the costs associated with course extensions
- Evaluate whether their situation meets the requirements for a course extension

Ever found yourself running out of time to finish your coursework? Life can throw unexpected challenges your way that might derail even the best study plans. That's why Excel offers course extensions in certain circumstances. This lesson breaks down when extensions are available, what they cost, and how to determine if you qualify.

### Core Concept 1: Extension Approval Criteria

Excel High School doesn't simply grant extensions to anyone who asks. To maintain academic standards and fairness, the school evaluates extension requests based on two main criteria:

1. **Reasonable Progress:** You need to show that you've been actively working on your course and making consistent effort. This means:
   - Regular login activity
   - Completing assignments throughout the course (not just at the beginning)
   - Showing engagement with the course material

2. **Legitimate Reason:** You must have a valid explanation for needing extra time. Examples include:
   - Medical issues or health emergencies (yours or an immediate family member's)
   - Family emergencies (such as a death in the family)
   - Major unexpected work schedule changes
   - Technical difficulties beyond your control (with documentation)

When requesting an extension, be ready to provide supporting documentation. For medical issues, this might be a doctor's note, or for technical problems, evidence of the issues you faced. The clearer you can show that your situation meets these criteria, the better your chances of approval.

Remember: Extensions are meant to help students who've been putting in the effort but hit genuine roadblocks—not to rescue those who simply put off their coursework or didn't make it a priority.

### Core Concept 2: Extension Fees and Timeframe

If you need more time for your coursework, here's what you should know about the financial side:

- **Cost:** The fee for a course extension is $200.
- **Duration:** This gives you an additional two months to complete your coursework.
- **Per Course:** The fee applies to each individual course you need to extend. So extending two courses would cost $400.

Before requesting an extension, think about these important points:

1. **Budget Impact:** $200 is a significant amount. Make sure this expense fits within your educational budget.

2. **Time Management:** Consider whether two additional months will be enough based on your progress and remaining work.

3. **Value Assessment:** Ask yourself if the extension is truly necessary. If you're close to finishing, it might be worth putting in extra effort now to avoid the fee.

4. **Planning Ahead:** The extension fee isn't refundable, even if you finish before the extended deadline.

The extension fee helps cover administrative costs of keeping your course active and maintaining instructor support beyond the original timeframe. It also encourages students to complete their coursework within the standard period when possible.

### Core Concept 3: What Doesn't Qualify for an Extension

Knowing what doesn't qualify for an extension is just as important as knowing what does. Excel High School has clear guidelines about invalid reasons:

**Lack of Participation** is the primary disqualifier. If you haven't been regularly engaging with your coursework, submitting assignments, or logging in, you won't qualify. Other invalid reasons include:

- Simply forgetting about deadlines
- Poor time management or putting things off
- Voluntary activities like sports, clubs, or non-emergency travel
- Not purchasing required materials in a timely manner
- Computer or internet issues that could have been sorted within the original timeframe

If you're struggling to keep up with your coursework, reach out to your instructors or academic advisors **early** for support. They can help you develop strategies to manage your workload before you reach the point of needing an extension.

Remember that online education develops not just academic knowledge but also valuable life skills like time management, planning, and responsibility—skills that will serve you well in university and your future career.

### Over to You:

1. Take a moment to assess your current progress in all your courses. Are there any where you might be falling behind? What specific steps can you take this week to get back on track?

2. Think about your personal schedule and commitments. What potential obstacles might arise that could impact your coursework completion? How can you plan ahead to address these challenges?

3. If you had to request an extension, how would you demonstrate both your reasonable progress and legitimate reason? What evidence could you provide?

### Summary

Excel High School's course extension policies are based on two key criteria: reasonable progress in your coursework and a legitimate reason for needing extra time. The extension fee is $200 and provides an additional two months to complete your course.

It's important to understand that lack of participation or poor time management aren't valid reasons for requesting an extension. By staying engaged with your courses consistently and reaching out for help early if you hit difficulties, you can often avoid needing an extension altogether.

As you continue your studies at Excel High School, use these guidelines to help you plan effectively, manage your time wisely, and make informed decisions about your educational journey. If unexpected circumstances do arise, you now know exactly how the extension process works and what you'll need to do.
