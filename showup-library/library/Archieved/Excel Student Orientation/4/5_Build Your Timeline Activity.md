# Build Your Timeline Activity

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** Module 1, Lesson 5

**Lesson Title:** Build Your Timeline Activity

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Calculate a personalised study schedule based on their course load and available study time
- Create a realistic completion timeline for their Excel High School courses
- Identify potential obstacles to their academic progress and develop strategies to overcome them

### Core Concept 1: Calculating Your Personalised Schedule

It's time to create your personal roadmap to success. Now that you understand Excel High School's flexible learning environment and effective study strategies, let's map out how you'll reach your goals. Having a clear plan will boost your confidence and motivation as you work toward your diploma.

The first step in building your timeline is figuring out how quickly you can progress through your courses based on your individual situation.

Our interactive calculator will help you visualise this:
1. Enter the number of active courses you plan to take: [Input field]
2. Enter how many hours you can realistically study each week: [Input field]

[Calculator processes inputs]

Based on your inputs, here's an estimate of your progress:
- Estimated time per course: [Calculated value]
- Projected completion timeframe: [Calculated value]

For example, if you're taking 2 courses and can study for 10 hours per week, you might complete your courses in about 4-6 months. This is just an estimate - some courses might take more or less time depending on the subject and your familiarity with it.

Remember, this timeline is meant to guide you, not pressure you. The flexibility of Excel High School's programme allows you to adjust your pace as needed.

### Core Concept 2: Setting Up Calendar Reminders

Now that you have an idea of your timeline, let's set up some reminders to help you stay on track.

Regular check-ins with yourself really matter when learning online. Here are some key reminders you should consider adding to your calendar:

1. **Weekly study blocks**: Schedule specific times each week dedicated to your coursework
2. **Assignment deadlines**: As you progress, add important due dates
3. **Monthly progress reviews**: Take time each month to see if you're on track with your goals
4. **Midpoint check-in**: Set a reminder halfway to your estimated completion date

Would you like to set up these reminders now? [Yes/No buttons]

[If Yes] Great! Let's add these to your calendar. You can always adjust them later if your schedule changes.

[If No] That's okay! You can always set these up later when you're ready.

Many successful online students find that having regular reminders helps them stay consistent with their studies, even when life gets busy.

### Core Concept 3: Preparing for Potential Obstacles

Even with the best planning, challenges can appear along the way. Let's think about potential obstacles and how you might handle them.

Take a moment to consider: "What might get in the way of my studies, and how can I prepare for these challenges?"

Common obstacles students face include:

- **Time management struggles**: Balancing school, family, work, and social life can make finding study time difficult
- **Technical issues**: Computer problems or internet outages can interrupt your learning
- **Difficult course content**: Some subjects might be more challenging than others
- **Motivation dips**: It's normal to have days when you don't feel like studying
- **Unexpected life events**: Family emergencies or health issues can arise

For each potential obstacle, try to come up with a backup plan. For example:
- If time is tight, could you wake up 30 minutes earlier to study?
- If your computer breaks, is there a library or friend's house where you could work?
- If you're struggling with course content, have you bookmarked Excel High School's support resources?

By thinking about these challenges now, you'll be better prepared to handle them if they come up, keeping your education on track.

### Over to You:

1. Based on your calculated timeline, does this completion date work with your personal goals? Why or why not?

2. What specific times of day do you plan to dedicate to your studies? How will you protect this time from other commitments?

3. Think about a time when you successfully overcame an obstacle in the past. What strategies did you use that might help you with your Excel High School courses?

### Check Your Understanding

1. What two main factors does the timeline calculator use to estimate your completion date?
   A. Number of courses and weekly study hours
   B. Your age and grade level
   C. Previous academic performance
   D. Course difficulty ratings

2. Why is it helpful to set calendar reminders for your studies?
   A. To impress your teachers with your organisation
   B. To maintain consistency and stay on track with your goals
   C. Because it's required by Excel High School
   D. To compete with other students

3. Why is it important to anticipate potential obstacles to your progress?
   A. So you can avoid taking challenging courses
   B. To have excuses ready if you fall behind
   C. To develop strategies for overcoming challenges before they happen
   D. Because all students face exactly the same problems

### Summary

Well done! You've now created a personalised timeline for your Excel High School journey. You've calculated a realistic schedule based on your course load and available study time, set up important reminders to keep you on track, and thought about how to handle potential challenges along the way. This roadmap will serve as your guide as you work toward your diploma.

Remember, your timeline is flexible - it's okay to adjust it as you learn more about your own study habits and pace. The goal isn't perfection; it's progress. By planning ahead and preparing for challenges, you've already taken an important step toward success in your online education.

As you move forward with your courses, refer back to this timeline regularly and don't hesitate to reach out to your Excel High School teachers and advisors if you need support. You've got this!
