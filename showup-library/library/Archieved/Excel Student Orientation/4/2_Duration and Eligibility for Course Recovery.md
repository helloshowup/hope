## LEARNING COMPONENTS

Single Course Recovery gives you another shot when you've hit a roadblock with a particular subject. Let's look at who can take part in this programme, how long you've got to finish it, and what you'll need to do along the way. This information should help you decide if Single Course Recovery fits your needs and how to make the most of it.

### Core Concept 1: Eligibility for Single Course Recovery

At Excel High School, Single Course Recovery is available to students in grades 6 through 12. This means whether you're in middle school or preparing for graduation, you can take advantage of this programme if you need to improve your performance in a specific subject.

Why does Excel offer this wide grade range?

1. **Early intervention:** Middle school students can address academic challenges before entering high school.
2. **Graduation support:** High school students can recover credits needed for graduation.
3. **Skill building:** Students at all levels can strengthen their understanding of important concepts.

The eligibility criteria are intentionally inclusive to support as many students as possible. However, the specific courses available may vary depending on your grade level and academic programme.

Before enrolling in Single Course Recovery, it's worth speaking with your academic advisor. They can help you determine if this option aligns with your educational goals and how it fits into your overall academic plan at Excel High School.

### Core Concept 2: Six-Month Completion Window

Once you enrol in a Single Course Recovery programme at Excel High School, you have six months to complete the course. This time frame gives you enough flexibility while ensuring you maintain momentum toward completion.

The six-month window begins on your enrolment date and includes all coursework, assignments, and final assessments. Here's why this timeframe works well:

1. **Flexibility:** You can balance your recovery course with regular studies and personal commitments.
2. **Focus:** The defined period helps you concentrate on mastering the material without dragging the process out too long.
3. **Planning opportunity:** Six months gives you enough time to create a realistic study schedule that fits your life.

While six months might seem like plenty of time, it can fly by! Consider these tips for making the most of your time:

- Mark your start and end dates on a calendar
- Break the course into weekly goals
- Schedule regular study sessions
- Track your progress consistently
- Don't leave everything until the last month

Remember, extensions beyond the six-month window are rarely granted, so planning your approach from the beginning is key to your success.

### Core Concept 3: Student Responsibility in Self-Paced Progress

One of the most important aspects of Single Course Recovery is that it's self-paced. This means you're in charge of your own learning journey within the six-month timeframe. This independence offers great benefits but also requires commitment and self-discipline.

As a student in a self-paced recovery course, you're responsible for:

1. **Setting your schedule:** Deciding when and how often to work on your course
2. **Maintaining momentum:** Logging in regularly and making consistent progress
3. **Seeking help when needed:** Reaching out to teachers when you encounter challenges
4. **Managing your time:** Balancing this course with your other responsibilities
5. **Tracking your progress:** Monitoring how you're advancing toward completion

This level of responsibility is excellent preparation for university and careers, where self-management is a valuable skill. However, it can be challenging if you're used to more structured learning environments.

To succeed in this self-paced format, try these strategies:

- Create a weekly schedule with specific times dedicated to your recovery course
- Set mini-deadlines for completing different sections
- Find an accountability partner (like a parent or friend) who can check in on your progress
- Use the course progress tools to visualise how far you've come
- Celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated

Remember, while the course is self-paced, you're not alone. Excel High School provides resources and instructor support throughout your journey—but it's up to you to take the initiative and reach out when you need assistance.
