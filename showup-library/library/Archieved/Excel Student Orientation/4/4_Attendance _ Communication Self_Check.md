# Attendance & Communication Self‑Check

<Explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for high school students:

1. Removed the generic "Welcome to..." introduction and replaced it with a more direct, engaging opening
2. Replaced "essential" with more natural alternatives like "important," "key," and "fundamental"
3. Changed American spelling to British (e.g., "programme" instead of "program")
4. Varied sentence structures and reduced repetitive phrasing
5. Made language more conversational while maintaining professionalism
6. Added the "Over to You" heading for the reflection activity
7. Simplified some complex sentences for better readability
8. Added more natural transitions between sections
9. Removed some redundant information to improve flow
10. Made the tone more supportive and less formal

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

### Core Concept 1: Attendance Policy Review

Your active participation is key to your academic success. The attendance policy helps you stay on track with your studies and develop consistent learning habits. Here's what you need to know:

- **Regular Login Requirement**: Log in to your courses at least three times weekly per course
- **Active Participation**: Attendance means more than just logging in—it includes completing assignments, participating in discussions, and engaging with course materials
- **Absence Notifications**: If you know you'll be unable to log in for an extended period (like travel or illness), notify your teachers in advance
- **Consequences**: Extended periods of inactivity may affect your academic standing and could result in being marked absent

Consistent attendance in your online courses helps you build good study habits, stay on top of your coursework, and develop the self-discipline needed for future university and career success.

### Core Concept 2: Communication Expectations

Clear communication is particularly important in an online learning environment where you don't see your teachers face-to-face. As a student, you're expected to:

- **Check Your Email Daily**: Your Excel High School email account is the primary way teachers and staff will contact you
- **Respond Promptly**: Aim to reply to messages from teachers and staff within 24-48 hours
- **Use Professional Language**: When writing emails or messages, use proper grammar, complete sentences, and a respectful tone
- **Be Proactive**: Don't wait until you're struggling—reach out early if you have questions or need help with your coursework
- **Use the Help Desk**: Remember to use the ticket system from the previous lesson when you need technical or administrative support

Good communication skills will not only help you succeed at Excel High School but are also valuable for university and future careers.
