# Consequences of Non-Participation

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 3

**Lesson Title:** Understanding the Consequences of Non-Participation

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Define truancy in an online learning environment and explain its consequences
- Describe the Notice of Intent to Withdraw process at Excel High School
- Explain the role of parents/guardians in monitoring student engagement

Regular participation is the backbone of success in your online studies at Excel High School. While online learning offers great flexibility, it also requires commitment to staying engaged with your coursework. This lesson explores what happens when students don't participate regularly, including how truancy works in an online setting and what steps Excel High School takes when engagement drops. Understanding these policies will help you stay on track and avoid complications that could derail your academic progress.

### Core Concept 1: Truancy Definition

In a traditional school, truancy means physically skipping class. But what does it mean in an online school like Excel High School? It's about digital absence and lack of engagement.

For online students, truancy typically includes:

1. Not logging into your courses regularly (at least three times per week)
2. Failing to submit assignments or participate in discussions
3. Ignoring communications from teachers or staff
4. Showing a pattern of inactivity in the learning management system

So why does this matter? When you don't participate regularly:

- You fall behind in your coursework (and trust me, catching up gets harder by the day)
- You miss important announcements and updates
- Your grades suffer due to missed assignments
- You might violate attendance requirements that apply in your location
- In serious cases, you could face withdrawal from your courses

Don't worry—occasional absences due to illness or family emergencies aren't immediately labelled as truancy, especially if you let your teachers know what's happening. The real concern arises when there's a consistent pattern of disappearing without communication.

### Core Concept 2: Notice of Intent to Withdraw Process

When a student's participation drops below Excel High School's requirements, the school starts the Notice of Intent to Withdraw process. This isn't about punishing students—it's about addressing serious non-participation and giving you a chance to get back on track.

Here's how the process typically unfolds:

1. **Early Warning Signs**: Teachers keep an eye on student activity and may reach out informally if they notice you haven't been logging in or submitting work.

2. **Initial Contact**: If non-participation continues, your teacher or adviser will contact you and your parents/guardians through email or phone to check in and offer support.

3. **Formal Notice**: If there's no improvement, a formal Notice of Intent to Withdraw is issued. This document will:
   - Specify exactly how your participation has fallen short
   - Outline what you need to do to remain enrolled
   - Provide a clear deadline (typically 5-10 school days)
   - Include contact information for getting help

4. **Grace Period**: During this time, you'll need to demonstrate renewed engagement by logging in regularly and completing required work.

5. **Resolution**: There are two possible outcomes:
   - If you successfully re-engage, the notice is resolved and you continue with your courses
   - If non-participation continues, you may be withdrawn from your course(s) or programme

This process gives you fair warning and a chance to sort things out before more serious consequences occur. The best approach? Maintain consistent participation so you never have to experience this process in the first place.

### Core Concept 3: Role of Parents/Guardians in Monitoring Engagement

Parents and guardians play a key role in your online education journey, particularly in helping you maintain regular participation. Their involvement can make a real difference in your success at Excel High School.

For students under 18, parent/guardian involvement is particularly important. Here's how they can support your engagement:

1. **Regular Check-ins**: Parents should chat with you about your course progress frequently, asking about assignments, deadlines, and any challenges you're facing.

2. **Creating a Supportive Learning Environment**: This includes making sure you have:
   - A quiet, dedicated space for schoolwork (not just trying to work from your bed!)
   - Reliable internet access and necessary technology
   - A consistent daily schedule for completing coursework

3. **Monitoring Activity**: Parents can help track your login frequency and assignment completion. Excel High School provides parent portal access where they can view your progress.

4. **Communication with School**: Parents should:
   - Promptly respond to any messages from teachers or staff
   - Reach out proactively if family circumstances might affect your participation
   - Help you communicate with teachers if you're struggling to do so

5. **Encouraging Time Management**: Parents can help you develop and maintain a study schedule that ensures you meet the minimum 20 hours per week of academic engagement.

Even for adult learners, having someone who checks in on your progress can be valuable. Consider sharing your goals and deadlines with a supportive family member or friend who can help keep you accountable.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your current online learning habits. What specific strategies could you implement to ensure you never fall into a pattern of non-participation? Create a brief plan for staying consistently engaged.

2. How might the consequences of truancy in online education affect your personal educational goals? Consider both immediate impacts and long-term effects.

3. If you were helping a friend who was struggling with consistent participation in their online courses, what advice would you give them? What resources or support might you suggest?

### Check Your Understanding

### Summary

Understanding the consequences of non-participation is fundamental for your success at Excel High School. This lesson covered how truancy is defined in an online learning environment, the Notice of Intent to Withdraw process, and the important role parents and guardians play in supporting consistent engagement.

Remember that the minimum participation requirements include logging in at least three times per week to each course and engaging in at least 20 hours of academic activity weekly. By maintaining regular participation, communicating with your teachers when issues arise, and utilising the support of parents/guardians, you can avoid the consequences of non-participation and make the most of your learning experience at Excel High School.

The next lesson will explore how to effectively use the Help Desk Ticket System to get assistance when you need it, ensuring you have the support necessary to stay engaged and successful in your courses.
