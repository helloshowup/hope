# Attendance & Communication Self‑Check

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 3

**Lesson Title:** Attendance & Communication Self-Check

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Evaluate their own attendance and communication practices
- Identify areas for improvement in their attendance and communication habits
- Create a personalised commitment plan to enhance their engagement with Excel High School

Let's be honest - developing good habits for attendance and communication takes some self-awareness. This lesson gives you a chance to take a step back and really look at how you're managing these aspects of your online education. These aren't just skills for school - they're valuable tools you'll use throughout college and your future career. The freedom of online learning is great, but it comes with the responsibility to stay engaged and communicate clearly.

### Core Concept 1: Attendance Self-Assessment

At Excel High School, "attendance" means more than just logging in – it's about consistently engaging with your coursework. Take a moment to honestly reflect on your current attendance habits:

1. **Logging In Regularly**: How often do you access your courses? Daily logins help you stay on track and show your commitment to learning.

2. **Following a Schedule**: Do you have set times for schoolwork? Having a consistent routine helps develop strong time management skills.

3. **Completing Assignments on Time**: Are you meeting deadlines? Timely submission shows responsibility and prevents you from falling behind.

4. **Participating in Discussions**: Are you actively contributing to forums and class discussions? Your voice matters and enriches everyone's learning experience.

5. **Communicating About Absences**: When you can't log in or complete work, do you let your teachers know? Proactive communication shows respect and responsibility.

Consider these attendance patterns:
- **Strong**: Logging in 4-5 times weekly, following a consistent schedule, completing work on time
- **Needs Improvement**: Logging in only occasionally, having no regular schedule, frequently missing deadlines

Remember, the flexibility of online learning requires self-discipline. Your success depends on establishing habits that work for your life while ensuring regular engagement with your courses.

What specific attendance patterns do you notice in your own behaviour? Be honest with yourself – identifying these patterns is the first step toward improvement.

### Core Concept 2: Communication Self-Assessment

Good communication is a must in online learning. Without face-to-face interaction, clear and proactive communication becomes even more important. Think about these aspects of how you communicate:

1. **Clarity**: When you write emails or post in discussions, are your messages clear and easy to understand? Clear communication prevents misunderstandings and saves everyone time.

2. **Timeliness**: How quickly do you respond to messages from teachers? Prompt responses (within 24-48 hours) show respect and keep your education moving forward.

3. **Tone**: Is your communication polite and professional? A respectful tone builds positive relationships with teachers and peers.

4. **Asking for Help**: Do you reach out when you're confused or struggling? Seeking help when needed is a sign of maturity, not weakness.

5. **Following Up**: After receiving feedback or instructions, do you acknowledge them and take appropriate action? This demonstrates responsibility and engagement.

6. **Using Appropriate Channels**: Are you using the right communication tools for different purposes (email for private matters, discussion boards for class topics)?

Consider these communication styles:
- **Proactive**: Regularly checking messages, promptly responding, reaching out for help before problems grow
- **Reactive**: Only communicating when absolutely necessary, waiting days to respond, hesitating to ask questions

Your goal should be developing proactive communication habits. Remember, your teachers want to help you succeed, but they can only do so if you communicate effectively with them.

What communication strengths and weaknesses do you notice in yourself? Identifying these patterns will help you focus your improvement efforts.

### Core Concept 3: Creating Your Commitment Plan

Now that you've assessed your attendance and communication practices, it's time to create a personal commitment plan. This plan will serve as your roadmap for improvement and success at Excel High School.

Follow these steps to create your plan:

1. **Identify Priorities**: Based on your self-assessment, what are the top 1-2 areas where improvement would have the biggest impact on your success? Focus on these first.

2. **Set SMART Goals**: For each priority area, create a Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goal. For example:
   - "I will log into my courses every weekday for at least 30 minutes per course."
   - "I will respond to all teacher messages within 24 hours."

3. **Develop Strategies**: What specific actions will help you achieve these goals? Consider:
   - Setting daily alarms as reminders to log in
   - Blocking specific times in your calendar for schoolwork
   - Creating a communication checklist to ensure you're responding to messages

4. **Plan for Obstacles**: What might get in your way, and how will you handle it? For instance:
   - If you get sick, who will you notify and how will you catch up?
   - If you're struggling with content, what's your plan to seek help?

5. **Make It Official**: Complete the digital commitment pledge at the end of this lesson. Consider sharing it with a parent, guardian, or mentor who can support your efforts.

Remember, this commitment is primarily to yourself and your future. By following through, you're building habits that will serve you well throughout your education and career.

### Over to You:

1. Based on your attendance self-assessment, what is one specific habit you want to improve, and how do you think this change will benefit your learning experience at Excel High School?

2. Think about your communication style. What is one way you could be more proactive in your communications with teachers, and what might be preventing you from doing this currently?
