Ever failed a class or fallen behind on credits? Don't worry—it happens to plenty of students. Single Course Recovery offers a practical solution to help you get back on track without repeating an entire year.

This lesson explores how Single Course Recovery works and why it matters for your academic journey. Whether you need to improve a grade or catch up on credits, understanding this option will help you plan your path to graduation.

### Core Concept 1: Definition and Purpose of Single Course Recovery

Single Course Recovery is an educational approach that helps students who have failed or struggled with a specific class. It gives you the chance to earn credit for a course you previously didn't pass, without repeating an entire semester or school year.

It's basically a second chance to learn the material and earn the credit you need to stay on track. Unlike traditional classrooms, Single Course Recovery takes a more focused approach that zeroes in on the subject where you need improvement.

The key benefits include:

1. **Credit recovery:** Earn the credits you need to stay on track for graduation.
2. **Targeted learning:** Focus specifically on areas where you struggled, rather than repeating content you already understand.
3. **Flexible scheduling:** Take these courses alongside your regular classes or during breaks.
4. **Improved academic standing:** Successfully completing a recovery course can boost your GPA and strengthen your academic record.

For instance, if you didn't pass Biology during the regular school year, you might enrol in a Single Course Recovery option for just that subject. This lets you concentrate on the science concepts you found difficult without falling behind in other subjects.

Single Course Recovery goes beyond just passing a class—it ensures you properly understand important concepts you'll need for future courses and beyond school.

### Core Concept 2: Self-Paced Structure

One of the most helpful aspects of Single Course Recovery is its self-paced structure. This means you can move through the material at a speed that works for you, rather than being locked into a fixed classroom schedule.

In a traditional classroom, everyone progresses at the same pace. But in a self-paced recovery course, you have the freedom to:

1. **Set your own schedule:** Work on your course when it fits your life—early mornings, evenings, or weekends.
2. **Take more time with challenging concepts:** If you're struggling with a particular topic, you can spend extra time on it before moving forward.
3. **Move quickly through familiar material:** For content you already understand well, you can complete it efficiently and focus your energy where it's most needed.
4. **Track your own progress:** Regular assessments help you monitor how you're advancing through the course.

While this flexibility is beneficial, it also requires good self-discipline and time management. You'll need to take responsibility for your progress and stay motivated. Success in this environment means creating your own study schedule, setting personal deadlines, and consistently engaging with the course material.

For example, if you're retaking Algebra I, you might find that you understand linear equations well but need more time with quadratic functions. In a self-paced course, you can quickly review the concepts you know and dedicate more time to practising the challenging material until you truly get it.

Remember, self-paced doesn't mean unlimited time. At Excel High School, Single Course Recovery options typically have a six-month completion window, giving you flexibility while still maintaining a timeline for completion.

### Core Concept 3: Alignment with Standards and Credit Acceptance

Single Course Recovery options at Excel High School are carefully designed to align with state and national educational standards. This means the content and skills you'll learn meet the same rigorous requirements as traditional classroom courses.

This alignment matters because:

1. **Quality assurance:** You can be confident that you're learning the necessary material required for that subject.
2. **Credit validity:** Standards-aligned courses are more likely to be accepted by schools and colleges.
3. **Future preparation:** The knowledge and skills you gain will prepare you for more advanced courses and standardised tests.

However, it's important to understand that policies regarding credit acceptance vary between schools and districts. Before enrolling in any Single Course Recovery option, you must confirm with your home school that they will accept the credits you earn.

This confirmation process typically involves:
- Speaking with your school counsellor or administrator
- Providing information about Excel High School's accreditation and course offerings
- Getting written approval before beginning the course

Taking this step ensures that your hard work will count toward your graduation requirements. It also helps avoid any disappointments later when you're trying to apply those credits toward your diploma.

### Over to You:

1. Think about a subject you've found challenging. How might a self-paced recovery course help you learn that content?
2. What strategies would you use to stay motivated and on track in a self-paced learning environment?
3. Why do you think it's important for recovery courses to align with state and national standards?
