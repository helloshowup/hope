## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate how to share their attendance commitment with a parent or guardian

Regular engagement with your online courses directly impacts your academic success. Just as showing up matters in traditional schools, logging in consistently helps you thrive in the digital classroom. This lesson introduces your digital attendance pledge – a simple yet meaningful tool to help you stay on track with your studies. By committing to a regular login schedule and sharing it with someone who supports you, you're setting yourself up for success in your online learning journey.

### Core Concept 1: Why Regular Engagement Matters

In online learning, "attendance" means something different than in a traditional classroom. It's about consistently engaging with your course materials, completing assignments, and participating in discussions. Regular engagement matters for several reasons:

1. **Steady Progress**: Logging in frequently helps you stay on track with course deadlines and prevents last-minute cramming.

2. **Better Learning**: When you interact with course content regularly, you're more likely to understand and remember what you're learning.

3. **Habit Formation**: Regular logins help establish a study routine, making your coursework feel like a natural part of your day.

4. **Support Access**: Consistent engagement means you can ask questions and get help when you need it, rather than struggling alone.

Students who log in at least three times per week for each course tend to perform better academically. This frequency strikes a good balance – it's frequent enough to keep the material fresh in your mind but not so demanding that it becomes overwhelming.

### Core Concept 2: Creating Your Digital Attendance Pledge

Now, let's create your personalised digital attendance pledge. This isn't just paperwork – it's a commitment to yourself and your education. Here's how to create a pledge that works for you:

1. **Look at your schedule**: When are you most alert and focused? When do you have reliable internet access? Choose three specific days each week when you can commit to logging into each of your courses.

2. **Be specific**: Instead of saying "I'll log in regularly," try "I will log in every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon for at least 30 minutes per session."

3. **Make it realistic**: Consider your other commitments and set a schedule you can actually maintain. It's better to start with a manageable commitment and build from there.

4. **Write it down**: Use the Excel High School Digital Pledge tool (available in your student dashboard) to create your official pledge. Select your courses, check the boxes for your chosen login days, and write a brief statement about why this commitment matters to you.

Here's a sample pledge:

"I, [Your Name], commit to logging into each of my Excel High School courses three times per week – on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I understand that consistent engagement is key for my success as an online student, and I'm dedicated to making my education a priority."

### Core Concept 3: Sharing Your Commitment

Involving someone you trust in your educational journey can significantly boost your accountability and provide valuable support. Excel High School makes it easy to share your digital pledge:

1. **Download Option**: After creating your pledge, you can download it as a PDF. This creates a tangible reminder you can print and display in your study space.

2. **Email Feature**: You can directly email your pledge to a parent, guardian, or mentor. This keeps them in the loop and opens the door for conversations about your progress.

Sharing your pledge has several benefits:
- It shows you're serious about your education
- It helps your support person understand your schedule and commitments
- It creates a natural opportunity to discuss any help or resources you might need
- It provides external accountability to help you stay on track

Remember, sharing your pledge isn't about having someone monitor your every move. It's about building a support system that helps you achieve your goals.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your typical week. What three days would work best for you to consistently log in to your Excel High School courses? Consider your other activities, when you feel most focused, and when you have reliable internet access.

2. What specific challenges might make it difficult for you to stick to your login schedule? How could you plan ahead to overcome these obstacles?

3. Who would be the best person to share your digital pledge with? How might they help support your commitment to regular course engagement?
