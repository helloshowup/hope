# 24/7 Access and Office Support Hours

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 2

**Lesson Title:** 24/7 Access and Office Support Hours at Excel High School

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain Excel High School's 24/7/365 platform access policy
- Identify the specific office hours for staff support
- Describe the Help Desk ticket triage process for after-hours inquiries

### Core Concept 1: 24/7/365 Platform Access

One of the biggest advantages of studying with Excel High School is that you can access your courses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. This means you can log in to study, complete assignments, and take assessments whenever it works best for you.

What does this 24/7 access mean for you?

- Study early in the morning or late at night – whatever fits your schedule
- Work on weekends or holidays if that's when you have free time
- Access all course materials, readings, and assignments at any time
- Submit work whenever it's ready, not just during business hours

This flexibility works brilliantly for:
- Athletes with demanding practice schedules
- Students with part-time jobs
- Those with family responsibilities
- Anyone who prefers to learn at their own pace

While the platform is always available, try to create a consistent study schedule that works for you. The flexibility is there to help you succeed, not to make you feel like you should be studying around the clock!

### Core Concept 2: Office Hours for Staff Support

Although you can access your courses anytime, our staff and teachers are available during specific hours:

**Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST)**

During these office hours, you can:
- Get quick responses to emails and messages
- Receive help with technical issues
- Ask questions about assignments
- Schedule one-on-one support with teachers
- Receive graded work and feedback

If you live in a different time zone, you'll need to adjust for the time difference:
- Eastern Time: Add 1 hour (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM)
- Mountain Time: Subtract 1 hour (7:00 AM to 4:00 PM)
- Pacific Time: Subtract 2 hours (6:00 AM to 3:00 PM)

Pro tip: Save your trickiest assignments for times when staff support is available. That way, if you get stuck, help is just a message away!

### Core Concept 3: Help Desk Ticket System for After-Hours Support

What happens if you need help at midnight or on the weekend? Don't worry - Excel High School has a system for that!

Our Help Desk ticket system works like this:

1. **Submit a ticket anytime** - Even outside office hours, you can always submit a help request through your student portal.

2. **Automatic confirmation** - You'll receive an immediate confirmation that your ticket was received.

3. **Priority sorting** - The system automatically categorises tickets by urgency:
   - High priority: Technical issues preventing course access
   - Medium priority: Assignment questions with approaching deadlines
   - Standard priority: General questions and non-urgent matters

4. **Next business day response** - When office hours resume, our support team reviews all tickets in priority order and responds accordingly.

For most issues, you can expect a response within one business day. For example, if you submit a ticket on Friday night, you'll likely receive a response on Monday morning.

Planning ahead makes a big difference! If you have an assignment due Monday, try to ask questions by Friday afternoon rather than Sunday night.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your typical daily schedule. When do you think you'll most often access your Excel High School courses?

2. If you live in a different time zone, what are Excel's office hours in your local time? How might this affect when you ask for help?

3. Imagine you're working on an important assignment due tomorrow, but you're stuck on a concept and it's after office hours. What steps would you take to address this situation?

### Summary

Understanding this setup helps you plan your study time more effectively—working independently during off-hours and saving your challenging work for times when support is readily available. This mix of flexibility and structure is designed to help you get the most out of your online learning experience at Excel High School.
