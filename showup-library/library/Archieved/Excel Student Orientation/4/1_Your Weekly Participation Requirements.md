# Your Weekly Participation Requirements

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 2

**Lesson Title:** Your Weekly Participation Requirements

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Define substantive participation in online coursework
- Identify the minimum weekly time and login requirements for Excel High School courses
- Differentiate between participation expectations for students under 18 and adult learners

### Introduction

Starting a new online course can feel quite different from sitting in a traditional classroom. At Excel High School, your active involvement matters tremendously for your success. Without face-to-face interactions where teachers can see you raising your hand or working on assignments, we need different ways to track your engagement. This lesson outlines what you need to do each week to stay on track with your courses and make the most of your learning experience.

### Core Concept 1: Defining Substantive Participation

Substantive participation means actively engaging with your coursework in meaningful ways. It goes beyond simply logging in or submitting assignments—it's about genuinely connecting with the material and showing your understanding.

What counts as substantive participation at Excel High School:

- Posting thoughtful responses in discussion forums that demonstrate critical thinking
- Asking questions that show you're engaging with the course content
- Providing helpful feedback to your classmates
- Completing all assigned readings and activities
- Taking part in group projects or collaborative assignments

Think about it this way: if you were in a physical classroom, substantive participation would be like raising your hand to answer questions, joining in group discussions, and staying focused during lessons. In the online environment, we need different ways to see this same level of engagement.

Remember, quality matters just as much as quantity. A well-thought-out response that shows deep understanding is far more valuable than several surface-level comments.

### Core Concept 2: Weekly Minimum Requirements

To help you make consistent progress, Excel High School has established two key weekly requirements:

1. **Time Commitment: 20 hours per week**
   This includes all course-related activities such as:
   - Reading course materials
   - Watching instructional videos
   - Completing assignments and projects
   - Participating in discussions
   - Studying for quizzes and exams

   Twenty hours breaks down to about 4 hours per day for a 5-day school week—similar to the time you'd spend in a traditional school day plus homework.

2. **Login Frequency: Three logins per course each week**
   This means you need to access each of your courses at least three separate times weekly. This helps you:
   - Stay connected to your coursework
   - Participate in ongoing discussions
   - Keep up with assignments
   - Develop a consistent study routine

These requirements are minimums—many successful students find they need to invest additional time to thoroughly understand the material and achieve their academic goals.

### Core Concept 3: Expectations for Different Age Groups

While the core participation requirements apply to all students, there are some differences in how these expectations work for younger students versus adult learners:

**For Students Under 18:**
- Parents or guardians may be more involved in monitoring your progress
- You might receive more frequent check-ins from instructors or advisors
- Your participation may be tracked more closely to help you develop good study habits
- Additional support is available to help you manage your time effectively

**For Adult Learners:**
- You'll have more flexibility in scheduling when you complete your 20 hours of weekly study
- You're expected to take more initiative in seeking help when needed
- Your life and work experiences can be valuable contributions to discussions
- You'll need to balance your coursework with other adult responsibilities

Regardless of your age, all Excel High School students are held to the same academic standards and must meet the minimum participation requirements. The main difference is in the level of independence and self-direction expected from adult learners.

### Over to You:

1. Look at your weekly schedule. When will you set aside time for your 20 hours of coursework? Try creating a simple weekly study schedule that works with your other commitments.

2. What strategies will you use to ensure your participation is substantive? Think about how you can contribute meaningfully to discussions rather than just posting brief responses.

3. How will you remember to log in to each course at least three times per week? Consider setting reminders on your phone or creating a tracking system to help you develop this habit.

### Summary

Substantive participation means actively engaging with course materials and discussions in ways that show your understanding and critical thinking. All students must commit to at least 20 hours of coursework weekly and log in to each course three times per week at minimum.
