## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

Managing your time well can make or break your success at Excel High School. Let's face it - juggling coursework, personal commitments, and maybe even a part-time job isn't easy! Having all your important dates and deadlines in one place gives you a huge advantage. This lesson will show you how to get your school calendar working with the digital calendar you already use.

Once you've synced everything up, you'll never have that moment of panic when you suddenly remember an assignment was due yesterday. Plus, this is exactly the kind of organisational skill that will serve you well beyond high school - whether you're heading to university or straight into work.

Let's sort out your calendar and get you on track!

### Core Concept 1: Downloading the Excel High School Calendar

The first step in staying organised is obtaining the Excel High School calendar. The process is simple and involves downloading a .ics file (a universal calendar file format that works with most digital calendar applications).

To download the calendar:
1. Log in to your Excel High School student portal
2. Navigate to the "Resources" section
3. Look for the "Academic Calendar" link
4. Click on "Download .ics File"

This file contains all the important dates for the school year, including:
- Term start and end dates
- Assignment due dates
- Exam periods
- School holidays and breaks
- Pacing checkpoints to help you stay on track

The pacing checkpoints serve as reminders throughout the term to help you gauge whether you're progressing at the right pace. For example, you might see checkpoints like "25% of coursework should be completed by this date."

Downloading this calendar is your first step toward better time management. Next, you'll learn how to add it to your personal digital calendar.

### Core Concept 2: Syncing with Popular Calendar Applications

Now that you have the .ics file, here's how to sync it with three popular calendar applications: Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.

**Google Calendar:**
1. Open Google Calendar in your web browser
2. Click the "+" sign next to "Other calendars" in the left sidebar
3. Select "Import" from the dropdown menu
4. Click "Select file from your computer" and choose the downloaded .ics file
5. Select which calendar you want to add the events to (or create a new one)
6. Click "Import"

**Apple Calendar (on Mac or iOS):**
1. Open the Calendar app
2. Go to File > Import (on Mac) or tap the "Calendars" button > Add Calendar > Add from File (on iOS)
3. Locate and select the downloaded .ics file
4. Choose which calendar you want to add the events to
5. Click "Import" or "Add"

**Microsoft Outlook:**
1. Open Outlook and go to the Calendar view
2. Click "File" > "Open & Export" > "Import/Export"
3. Choose "Import an iCalendar (.ics) or vCalendar file (.vcs)"
4. Browse to the location of your downloaded .ics file and select it
5. Click "Open" to import the calendar

After following these steps, you'll see all the Excel High School events and deadlines integrated into your personal calendar. This allows you to view your academic commitments alongside your personal events, helping you manage your time more effectively.

If the school calendar gets updated during the year, you can always download the latest .ics file and repeat this process to stay current.

### Core Concept 3: Planning for Success

With your calendars now synced, it's time to think about how to use this tool effectively for your academic success. One key aspect of planning is anticipating potential conflicts and developing strategies to manage them.

Review your newly integrated calendar and identify any upcoming holidays or personal events that might impact your study schedule. For each potential conflict, consider the following:

1. **Prioritise:** Determine which commitments are most important or have fixed deadlines.
2. **Plan ahead:** If you see a busy period coming up (like holidays or family events), start working on assignments early.
3. **Create buffer time:** Allow extra time before deadlines in case unexpected events arise.
4. **Use reminders:** Set up notifications for important deadlines to avoid last-minute rushes.
5. **Be flexible:** Sometimes, you may need to adjust your personal plans to accommodate school commitments.

For example, if you notice a major holiday approaching, you might:
- Complete assignments early to free up time during the holiday
- Allocate extra study time in the days before or after the holiday
- Contact your instructors in advance if you think you might need extensions

By planning ahead for these events, you'll be better prepared to manage your time effectively and maintain your academic progress.

### Over to You:
