# U.S. Holidays and School Closures

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 5

**Lesson Title:** U.S. Holidays and School Closures

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify major U.S. holidays and their observance dates
- Explain how weekend holidays may shift to weekdays
- Recognise that coursework remains accessible during school closures

Planning your studies around holidays can be tricky. This lesson covers the major U.S. holidays, explains how holiday dates sometimes shift, and highlights one of the best advantages of online learning—your coursework remains available even during school closures. Understanding this calendar will help you organise your study schedule more effectively throughout the year.

### Core Concept 1: Major U.S. Holidays and Observance Dates

The United States celebrates several important holidays throughout the year. Here are the major ones you should know about:

1. New Year's Day - January 1
2. Martin Luther King Jr. Day - Third Monday in January
3. Presidents' Day - Third Monday in February
4. Memorial Day - Last Monday in May
5. Independence Day - July 4
6. Labour Day - First Monday in September
7. Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples' Day - Second Monday in October
8. Veterans Day - November 11
9. Thanksgiving Day - Fourth Thursday in November
10. Christmas Day - December 25

Some holidays always fall on the same date (like Christmas on December 25), while others are observed on specific days of the week (like Memorial Day on the last Monday in May). This information helps when planning your study schedule throughout the year.

During these holidays, Excel High School's administrative offices will be closed, which means staff won't be available to answer questions or grade assignments. However, your courses will still be accessible—more on that in Core Concept 3!

### Core Concept 2: Weekend Holiday Observances Shifting to Weekdays

What happens when a holiday falls on a weekend? For holidays with fixed dates (like Independence Day on July 4), the observance often shifts to a weekday when they fall on a weekend:

- If a holiday falls on a Saturday, it's usually observed on the preceding Friday.
- If a holiday falls on a Sunday, it's usually observed on the following Monday.

For example:
- If July 4th lands on a Saturday, Excel High School would likely observe it on Friday, July 3rd.
- If Christmas (December 25) falls on a Sunday, the school would likely observe it on Monday, December 26th.

This affects when school staff will be available to help you. Always check the official Excel High School calendar for the exact observance dates, as they may change from year to year.

### Core Concept 3: Coursework Accessibility During School Closures

Here's good news about being an online student: Your coursework is always accessible, even during holidays and school closures! This means:

- You can log in to your student portal any time, day or night
- All your course materials, readings, and assignments remain available
- You can submit completed work at any time
- You can continue learning at your own pace

This flexibility is a major advantage of online learning. It allows you to:
- Catch up on assignments during a long holiday weekend if you've fallen behind
- Work ahead before a holiday if you want to take time off
- Create your own schedule that balances schoolwork with holiday celebrations

Just remember: While your courses are always accessible, school staff won't be available to answer questions or grade assignments during official holidays. Plan accordingly by addressing any urgent questions before the holiday break begins.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your own study habits. How might you use the continuous access to coursework during holidays to your advantage? Would you prefer to work ahead before a holiday or use the holiday to catch up?

2. Look at a calendar for this year. Find a holiday that falls on a weekend and determine which weekday it would likely be observed on. How might this affect your study schedule?

3. What strategies could you use to stay on track with your coursework around major holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas when you might have family obligations?
