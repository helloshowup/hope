## Over to You

**Which skill feels least familiar? Note one action you'll take this week to practise it.**

Take a few minutes to think about your digital skills. Knowing what to improve now will help you feel more confident in your courses.

For example:
- *"I'm least comfortable with organising files. This week, I'll create a folder system for my courses and practise saving documents with clear names."*
- *"I need to improve my email skills. I'll practise writing three professional emails using proper formatting and checking for clarity before sending."*
- *"Search techniques are challenging for me. I'll spend 20 minutes trying different search operators to find specific information for my upcoming assignments."*

The more you use these skills, the more natural they'll become. Plus, these digital abilities will serve you well beyond school—they're valuable for university and future jobs too.

**Your Reflection:**
[Space for student response]

If you're struggling with any skills, try spending 15-30 minutes each day this week working on that specific area. Short, regular practise sessions work better than one marathon session. And remember, your academic advisor is just a message away in your student portal if you need help.
