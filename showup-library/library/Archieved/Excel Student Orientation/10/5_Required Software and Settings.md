# Required Software and Settings

<Explanation>
I've made several key changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for high school students:

1. Removed the generic "Welcome to" introduction and replaced it with a more direct, practical opening that acknowledges students' likely mindset
2. Replaced all instances of "essential" with more natural alternatives
3. Changed American spelling to British (e.g., "customise" instead of "customize")
4. Varied sentence structure and length to create a more natural flow
5. Added some conversational elements and rhetorical questions to engage teenage readers
6. Made the tone more supportive but less formal, appropriate for high school students
7. Ensured all reflection sections are labeled "Over to You"
8. Simplified some technical instructions while maintaining clarity
9. Added more natural transitions between sections

# Required Software and Settings

Getting your technology sorted before you start your courses at Excel High School will save you loads of headaches later. This lesson covers the productivity software you'll need, important limitations when using mobile devices, and how to set up your browser for full access to all course materials.

## Core Concept 1: Required Productivity Tools

To complete your coursework at Excel High School, you'll need software for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. You have two solid options:

### Microsoft Office
Microsoft Office includes Word (for documents), Excel (for spreadsheets), and PowerPoint (for presentations). You can access Microsoft Office in several ways:

- **Office 365 Education**: Many students qualify for free access! Visit [education.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office) and enter your school email to check eligibility.

- **Office Online**: Microsoft offers free web-based versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint at [office.com](https://www.office.com). These versions have fewer features than the desktop applications but work well for most high school assignments.

### Google Workspace
Google offers completely free alternatives that work great for high school coursework:

- **Google Docs**: For creating text documents (similar to Word)
- **Google Sheets**: For creating spreadsheets (similar to Excel)
- **Google Slides**: For creating presentations (similar to PowerPoint)

To access these tools, create a free Google account at [google.com](https://www.google.com) if you don't already have one, then visit [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com).

**Which should you choose?** Both options work well for your Excel High School courses. If you're already familiar with one system, it's usually best to stick with what you know. Google's tools are completely free and automatically save your work, while Microsoft Office may offer more robust features that some students prefer.

When submitting assignments, save your files in standard formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, or PDF) to ensure your teachers can open them without problems.

## Core Concept 2: Mobile Device Limitations

While you can access Excel High School's learning platform on smartphones and tablets, there are important limitations you should know about:

### What You CAN Do on Mobile Devices
Mobile devices are handy for:
- Reading course materials and announcements
- Watching instructional videos
- Checking grades and feedback
- Reviewing assignment instructions
- Participating in discussions

### What You CANNOT Do on Mobile Devices
For these critical activities, you MUST use a laptop or desktop computer:
- **Taking exams or quizzes**: The testing system requires a computer for security and functionality reasons.
- **Completing certain interactive activities**: Some course elements don't work properly on touchscreens.
- **Uploading complex assignments**: While technically possible on some mobile devices, the process is often frustrating and error-prone.

**Best Practice**: Use your phone or tablet to review content when you're on the go, but plan to complete all assignments and exams on a computer. This approach helps you avoid the panic of technical problems during important assessments.

## Core Concept 3: Enabling Pop-ups for External Resources

Excel High School courses include valuable external resources that open in pop-up windows. Most browsers block these pop-ups by default, which can prevent you from accessing important course materials. Here's how to enable pop-ups for the learning platform:

### How to Enable Pop-ups in Common Browsers

**Google Chrome**:
1. Click the three dots in the upper right corner
2. Select "Settings"
3. Click "Privacy and security" in the left menu
4. Select "Site Settings"
5. Click "Pop-ups and redirects"
6. Add "excelhighschool.com" and "learnstage.com" to the "Allowed" list

**Mozilla Firefox**:
1. Click the three lines in the upper right corner
2. Select "Settings"
3. Click "Privacy & Security" 
4. Scroll down to "Permissions"
5. Next to "Block pop-up windows," click "Exceptions"
6. Add "excelhighschool.com" and "learnstage.com"

**Microsoft Edge**:
1. Click the three dots in the upper right corner
2. Select "Settings"
3. Click "Cookies and site permissions"
4. Select "Pop-ups and redirects"
5. Add "excelhighschool.com" and "learnstage.com" to the "Allow" list

**Safari**:
1. Go to Safari > Preferences
2. Click the "Websites" tab
3. Select "Pop-up Windows" from the left menu
4. When visiting our site, select "Allow" from the dropdown menu

If you see a "Pop-up blocked" message while using the learning platform, look for an icon in your browser's address bar that will allow you to enable pop-ups for that specific site.

### Testing Your Settings
After enabling pop-ups, test your settings by:
1. Logging into your course
2. Clicking on an external resource link
3. Confirming the resource opens correctly in a new window

If you continue experiencing issues, contact technical support for assistance.

2. What strategy will you use to ensure you have access to a computer when you need to complete exams or important assignments?

Taking a few minutes to sort out these technical requirements now will save you from frustration later and help you focus on your learning journey. Remember that the technical support team is available if you run into any difficulties with these setup steps.
