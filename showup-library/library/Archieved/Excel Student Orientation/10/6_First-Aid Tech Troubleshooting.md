**Lesson Title:** First-Aid Tech Troubleshooting: Solving Common Technical Issues

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Apply basic troubleshooting techniques to resolve common technical issues
- Locate and use Excel High School's help resources independently
- Determine when to implement self-help strategies versus when to seek technical support

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

Technical problems happen to everyone during online learning. They're frustrating, but with a few simple skills, you can solve many issues without waiting for help. Think of these troubleshooting techniques as digital first aid - quick fixes you can apply before calling in the experts. Mastering these basics will not only keep your studies on track but also build problem-solving skills you'll use throughout school and beyond.

### Core Concept 1: Basic First-Aid Troubleshooting Steps

When you run into technical issues with the Excel High School learning platform, try these simple steps to get back on track quickly:

1. **Refresh Your Browser**: Sometimes the simplest fix works best. Click the refresh button in your browser (the circular arrow) or press F5 (Command+R on Mac). This often clears minor glitches.

2. **Clear Your Browser Cache**: Browsers store temporary files that can sometimes cause problems. To clear your cache:
   - In Chrome: Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear Browsing Data
   - In Firefox: Options → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data → Clear Data
   - In Edge: Settings → Privacy, Search and Services → Clear Browsing Data
   
   Tick "Cached images and files" and clear them. This often fixes pages that won't load properly.

3. **Try a Different Browser**: If you're still having trouble, switch browsers. If Chrome isn't working, try Firefox, Edge, or Safari to see if the problem disappears.

4. **Check Your Internet Connection**: Run a speed test (at speedtest.net) to make sure your connection is stable. For smooth performance, aim for:
   - Download speed: At least 5 Mbps
   - Upload speed: At least 1 Mbps
   - Ping/Latency: Less than 100ms

5. **Confirm Your Device Meets Requirements**: Make sure your computer has:
   - Updated operating system (Windows 10+ or macOS 10.14+)
   - At least 4GB RAM
   - Current version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari
   - JavaScript and cookies enabled

These five steps solve about 80% of all technical issues students face. Try each one in order before contacting support, and jot down any error messages you see if the problem continues.

### Core Concept 2: Finding and Using Excel High School Help Resources

Excel High School offers several helpful resources for when you get stuck:

**LMS Help Pages**
Our Learning Management System has built-in help you can access anytime:
1. Click on the "Help" icon in the navigation menu (question mark symbol)
2. Browse topics by category or use the search function
3. Follow the step-by-step guides with screenshots

These pages cover everything from navigating courses and submitting assignments to taking tests and managing your account.

**Orientation Videos**
We've created short videos showing you how to use the platform:
1. Find these on your Student Dashboard under "Resources"
2. Look for the "Tech Support" playlist for troubleshooting help
3. Videos are organised by topic and usually run 2-5 minutes

These videos are perfect if you prefer watching demonstrations rather than reading instructions. All videos include closed captioning.

### Core Concept 3: When to Seek Additional Technical Support

While self-help fixes work for most issues, sometimes you need professional help. Contact our technical support team when:

1. You've tried all the first-aid steps without success
2. Error messages keep appearing even in different browsers
3. You experience repeated crashes or timeouts
4. You can't access important course functions (assignments, tests, etc.)
5. You notice security concerns (suspicious messages, unauthorised access)

To submit a support ticket:
1. Log in to your student portal
2. Select "Technical Support" from the Help menu
3. Complete the ticket form with:
   - A clear description of the problem
   - Steps you've already taken to fix it
   - Screenshots of any error messages
   - Your device type and browser information

Our team typically responds within 24 hours on business days. If your issue affects an upcoming deadline, mention this clearly in your subject line.

### Over to You:

1. Think about a technical problem you've encountered in the past (with any digital platform). Which of the first-aid troubleshooting steps might have resolved that issue? Why?

2. Why do you think clearing browser cache can resolve many technical issues? What might be happening behind the scenes?

3. How might developing your technical troubleshooting skills benefit you beyond your coursework at Excel High School?

### Summary
