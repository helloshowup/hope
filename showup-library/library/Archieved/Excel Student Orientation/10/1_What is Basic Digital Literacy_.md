# What is Basic Digital Literacy?

<Analysis>
I've identified several AI patterns in this text that need humanizing for high school students (ages 14-18). The writing is overly formal, repetitive, and lacks a natural conversational tone that would engage teenage learners. Key issues include:

1. The generic "In today's digital world" introduction that's typical of AI writing
2. Overuse of the word "essential" (which needs replacement)
3. Lengthy, complex sentences that could be simplified
4. American spelling that needs to be changed to British spelling
5. Missing "Over to You" heading for the reflection section
6. Overall tone that feels too formal and impersonal for teenage learners

My edits focus on creating a more conversational, relatable tone while maintaining professionalism. I've varied sentence structures, added more direct address, and incorporated language that better connects with teenage students' experiences. I've also ensured all British spelling conventions are followed.

# What is Basic Digital Literacy?

Digital literacy skills are the backbone of your success at Excel High School. Before diving into your coursework, you'll want to make sure you have the fundamental digital abilities needed to navigate your online learning journey. This lesson helps you identify the core digital competencies required for all EHS courses and gives you a chance to assess your readiness.

## Core Concept 1: Defining Basic Digital Literacy for Excel High School

Basic digital literacy at Excel High School refers to the key technology skills you need to successfully participate in online learning. These foundational skills enable you to access course materials, complete assignments, communicate with instructors, and manage your digital learning experience.

For EHS students, basic digital literacy includes three primary skill areas:
1. The ability to navigate the internet confidently
2. Competence in email communication, including handling attachments
3. Proficiency in creating and editing documents using common productivity software

These skills form the foundation of your entire online learning experience. Without these competencies, completing coursework would be challenging. Think of digital literacy as the language you need to speak in the digital classroom environment.

Digital literacy goes beyond just technical know-how—it involves building confidence and problem-solving abilities that help you adapt to new digital tools. As you progress through your courses at EHS, your digital literacy skills will naturally grow and deepen.

## Core Concept 2: Digital Skills Checklist

Before beginning your coursework at Excel High School, make sure you can confidently perform these important digital tasks:

**Navigating the Internet:**
- Use a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to access websites
- Navigate between multiple browser tabs and windows
- Use search engines effectively to find information
- Bookmark important websites for easy access
- Complete online forms and navigate through multi-page processes
- Understand basic internet safety practices

**Email Communication:**
- Create, send, and reply to email messages
- Add recipients in the To, CC, and BCC fields appropriately
- Create a clear subject line that summarises your message
- Compose professional email messages with proper formatting
- Attach files to email messages (documents, images, etc.)

- Create bulleted and numbered lists
- Insert and modify tables, images, and other elements
- Save documents in appropriate file formats (.docx, .pdf, etc.)
- Share documents electronically
- Create basic spreadsheets to organise data
- Create simple presentations with multiple slides

These skills represent the minimum technical requirements for success in your Excel High School courses. If you're struggling with any of these areas, it's worth seeking additional training or resources before proceeding with your coursework.

## Core Concept 3: Applying Digital Literacy in Your EHS Coursework

You'll use your digital literacy skills immediately and continuously throughout your Excel High School experience. Here's how these skills translate to practical applications in your coursework:

**Internet Navigation in Action:**
- Accessing the EHS learning management system
- Researching topics for assignments
- Finding supplementary learning resources
- Taking online assessments and quizzes

**Email Communication in Practice:**

- Submitting assignments that can't be uploaded directly
- Receiving important announcements and feedback
- Collaborating with peers on group projects

**Document Skills Applied:**

Having these skills doesn't mean you need to be a technology expert. It simply means you can confidently use these tools to complete your coursework without technical barriers. Remember that developing digital literacy is a journey, not a destination. Even experienced technology users continue to learn and adapt as digital tools evolve.
