# Who Leads Excel High School

<Analysis>
I've identified several AI patterns in this text that need humanizing:
1. Overly formal and distant tone that doesn't connect well with high school students
2. Repetitive use of "ensure" and similar bureaucratic language
3. Excessive explanation of obvious concepts
4. Formulaic structure with predictable sections
5. Lack of authentic voice that would engage teenage learners
6. Too much corporate-style language about leadership and operations

My approach to editing:
- Created a more conversational, direct tone while maintaining professionalism
- Replaced "essential" with more natural alternatives
- Changed American to British spelling (e.g., "centered" to "centred")
- Added "Over to You" reflection section that was missing
- Simplified complex sentences while preserving key information
- Reduced repetition and corporate jargon
- Made the content more relatable to teenage students
- Maintained appropriate academic level for 14-18 year olds
