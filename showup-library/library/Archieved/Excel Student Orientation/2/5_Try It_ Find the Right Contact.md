## Why Contacting the Right Person Matters

Sending your question to the appropriate department or staff member makes a real difference:

## Tips for Effective Communication

When reaching out for help, keep these points in mind:

1. **Be specific** - Clearly explain your question or issue
2. **Include relevant details** - Your full name, student ID, and course information when needed

4. **Be patient** - Most departments respond within 24-48 business hours (1-2 school days)
5. **Follow up thoughtfully** - If you haven't heard back in the expected timeframe, a polite follow-up is fine
