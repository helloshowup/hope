# Accreditation Overview

# Accreditation Overview

Choosing the right online high school affects your future opportunities. Accreditation—the process that verifies a school meets established educational standards—directly impacts whether colleges, universities, employers and the military will accept your diploma. At Excel High School, we hold respected accreditations that demonstrate our commitment to quality education. Let's explore what these credentials mean for your academic journey.

## Regional Accreditation through Cognia

Excel High School is regionally accredited through Cognia, one of the most respected accrediting organisations in the United States. Cognia formed when three regional accrediting bodies merged:

1. **North Central Association (NCA CASI)** - Serving schools in the north central region of the United States since 1895
   
2. **Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS CASI)** - Accrediting schools throughout the southern states since 1895
   
3. **Northwest Accreditation Commission (NWAC)** - Serving schools in the northwestern United States

What does this mean for you? Colleges and universities across the country will recognise your Excel High School diploma and credits. Cognia evaluates our:
- Curriculum quality
- Teaching effectiveness
- Leadership
- Use of resources
- Student performance

This thorough evaluation confirms that your education at Excel High School meets high standards that prepare you for success after graduation.

## Systems Accreditation by Middle States Association

Excel High School has also earned systems accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA). With a history dating back to 1887, MSA is among the oldest and most respected accrediting bodies in the United States.

Unlike more limited evaluations, MSA systems accreditation examines our entire educational framework, including:

- School leadership and organisation
- Educational programmes and curriculum
- Assessment of student learning
- Student support services
- Resources and facilities

This additional accreditation provides further assurance that your Excel High School education meets rigorous standards recognised throughout the United States and internationally.

## Why Accreditation Matters for You

Accreditation directly shapes your future opportunities:

- **College Acceptance**: Colleges and universities recognise diplomas from regionally accredited schools like Excel High School
  
- **Credit Transfer**: Credits you earn at Excel High School can transfer to other accredited schools if you move or change schools
  
- **Financial Aid**: Students from accredited schools qualify for federal financial aid programmes when they attend college
  
- **Employment**: Many employers verify that job applicants' diplomas come from accredited schools
  
- **Military Enlistment**: The U.S. military recognises diplomas from regionally accredited schools

Having dual accreditation through both Cognia and the Middle States Association gives you a significant advantage as you plan your next steps after high school.
