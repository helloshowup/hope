# Why Accreditation Matters

# Why Accreditation Matters

Ever wondered if all high school diplomas carry the same weight? They don't. The difference often comes down to one key factor: accreditation. Many students and parents overlook this detail when choosing an online school, but it can significantly impact your future opportunities. Let's explore the difference between regional and national accreditation and why Excel High School's regional accreditation gives you a genuine advantage for your educational and career journey.

## Understanding Accreditation Types: Regional vs. National

Accreditation is a quality assurance process where independent agencies evaluate schools to confirm they meet established standards of educational quality. In the United States, two primary types exist: regional and national.

**Regional Accreditation** is widely considered the gold standard. The United States is divided into geographic regions, each with its own accrediting body that evaluates schools within that area. These regional accreditors apply stringent standards for faculty qualifications, academic quality, student support services, and institutional resources.

Regional accreditation agencies include organisations like the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and Cognia (formerly AdvancED), which accredits Excel High School.

**National Accreditation** typically focuses on specific types of institutions, often career, vocational, or religious schools. While legitimate, it generally follows different standards that emphasise specialised training rather than traditional academic education.

Think of it this way: Regional accreditation works like a passport recognised virtually everywhere, while national accreditation might be accepted in some places but questioned in others. Most colleges and universities prefer or exclusively accept credits from regionally accredited schools.

## The Impact of Regional Accreditation on Your Educational Journey

Regional accreditation directly affects two key aspects of your educational path: credit recognition and college transfer opportunities.

**Credit Recognition:** Credits earned at a regionally accredited institution like Excel High School are more likely to be recognised and accepted by other educational institutions. When you apply to university with a diploma from a regionally accredited high school, admissions officers immediately acknowledge the legitimacy of your academic achievements.

**College Transfer:** If you take dual enrolment courses (courses that count for both high school and college credit) or earn college credits during high school, those credits are much more likely to transfer to other institutions if they come from a regionally accredited school. Most regionally accredited colleges and universities only accept transfer credits from other regionally accredited institutions.

For example, if you complete Advanced Placement (AP) courses at Excel High School, colleges are more likely to award you university credit for these courses because our regional accreditation validates the quality of our curriculum. Without regional accreditation, you might find yourself repeating coursework or even being denied admission to certain institutions.

## The Real-World Value of Regional Accreditation

Beyond credit transfer, regional accreditation offers several other significant benefits:

1. **Enhanced Diploma Value:** A diploma from a regionally accredited school carries more weight with employers, who recognise it as meeting established educational standards.

2. **Financial Aid Eligibility:** Students from regionally accredited high schools generally have broader access to scholarships and financial aid programmes, as many funding sources require regional accreditation.

3. **Military Recognition:** The U.S. military recognises diplomas from regionally accredited schools for enlistment purposes and educational benefits.

4. **International Recognition:** For students with global aspirations, regional accreditation provides better recognition internationally than national accreditation.

Regional accreditation isn't about prestigeâ€”it's practical. It ensures the time and effort you put into your education will be valued wherever your future takes you.

## Over to You

1. How might attending a non-accredited or nationally (rather than regionally) accredited school potentially impact your future educational or career plans?

2. Why do you think colleges and universities place such high importance on regional accreditation when evaluating transfer credits?

3. What specific educational or career goals do you have that make Excel High School's regional accreditation important to you personally?
