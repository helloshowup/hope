# Meet Your Support Team

# Meet Your Support Team

At Excel High School, we know that having the right support makes all the difference in your online learning journey. Our team is ready to help you tackle any challenges that come your way. This section shows you how to get help when you need it and who to contact for different situations.

## Core Concept 1: Your Support Options

Excel High School offers four main ways to connect with our support team:

### Help Desk Ticket System
Our primary support channel is the Help Desk ticket system. This online platform allows you to submit detailed questions and receive documented responses from the appropriate staff member. The system tracks your request from submission to resolution, ensuring nothing gets overlooked.

### Phone Support
For immediate assistance or issues that are better explained through conversation, our support team is available by phone during business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM Central Time). This direct connection is especially helpful for complex situations.

### Email Support
Email provides a convenient way to reach specific departments or staff members directly. This method is great for sending attachments or communicating when you don't need an immediate response.

### Staff Directory
Our comprehensive staff directory is available on your student dashboard. This resource helps you identify exactly who to contact based on your specific needs, listing all teachers, counsellors, and support personnel along with their contact information.

## Core Concept 2: When to Use Each Support Option

Choosing the right communication channel will help you get faster, more effective assistance:

### When to Submit a Help Desk Ticket
* For most academic questions or technical issues
* When you need a record of your request and our response
* For enrolment, course access, or account-related questions
* When requesting transcript information
* If you're not sure which department handles your specific issue

**How to submit a ticket:**

4. Choose the appropriate category for your issue

6. Submit the ticket and note your ticket number

Help Desk tickets are typically responded to within 24-48 business hours (1-2 school days).

## Core Concept 3: Maximizing Support Effectiveness

Getting the most from our support team involves effective communication:

### Be Specific and Provide Context
When reaching out for help, include details such as:
* Your student ID
* The specific course name
* Assignment names or numbers
* For technical issues, describe exactly what happened and include screenshots if possible

### Follow the Response Chain
If you've already started a conversation through one channel (like a Help Desk ticket), continue using that same channel. This helps us maintain a complete record of the interaction.

### Check Available Resources First
Many common questions are answered in:
* Course materials
* The student handbook
* Our knowledge base
* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section

Checking these resources first may give you an immediate answer.

### Allow Appropriate Response Time
* Help Desk tickets and emails: typically within 24 business hours
* Phone calls during business hours: immediate connection
* Weekend or holiday communications: response on the next business day
