# Why Accreditation Matters

# Why Accreditation Matters

## Transfer & College Acceptance Guarantee

Ever wondered if your high school diploma will actually count when you apply to university? At Excel High School, our accreditation backs up your education with our Transfer & College Acceptance Guarantee.

### Why This Guarantee Matters to Your Future

Accreditation isn't just a fancy certificate hanging on a wall—it directly impacts your future opportunities. Our Transfer & College Acceptance Guarantee means colleges, universities, employers, and the military across the country recognise the credits and diploma you earn from Excel High School.

This guarantee means your hard work at Excel High School will:

1. **Transfer seamlessly** if you need to move to another accredited school
2. **Be recognised by colleges and universities** when you apply
3. **Meet educational requirements** for job opportunities
4. **Satisfy prerequisites** for military service and advancement

### The Difference Between Regional and National Accreditation

Excel High School holds accreditation through Cognia (formerly known as AdvancED), one of the most respected regional accrediting bodies in the United States. Regional accreditation is the gold standard for educational institutions—it's the same type that traditional brick-and-mortar schools have.

Why does regional accreditation matter? Because:
- Credits from regionally accredited schools like Excel are more widely accepted at universities
- Most four-year colleges prefer or require regional accreditation
- Regional accreditation involves more rigorous standards and evaluation

This regional accreditation removes any questions about your diploma's legitimacy, so you can be confident your Excel High School education will be valued wherever you go next.

### Real-World Impact on Your Future

Our accreditation benefits you in many practical ways:

**University Admissions**: Admissions offices across the country recognise Excel High School diplomas. Our graduates have been accepted to hundreds of colleges and universities.

**Financial Aid Eligibility**: With an accredited diploma, you'll qualify for federal financial aid, scholarships, and grants that might be unavailable to graduates of unaccredited programmes.

**Credit Transfer**: If you need to transfer to another high school or are taking dual-enrolment courses (college courses while in high school), credits earned at Excel High School transfer without complications.

**Employment Opportunities**: Employers value an accredited diploma, giving you an advantage in the job market.

**Military Enrolment**: All branches of the military recognise Excel High School diplomas.

### Student Success Stories

Don't just take our word for it—our graduates prove the value of our guarantee. Excel High School alumni have gone on to attend top universities, build rewarding careers, and achieve their goals.

A recent graduate told us: "When I applied to my top-choice university, I worried they might question my online high school diploma. Thanks to Excel's accreditation, the admissions process went smoothly, and I'm now studying engineering at my dream school."

### Your Assurance of Quality Education

The accreditation seal shows that your education meets established standards of excellence. The accreditation process requires Excel High School to:

- Employ qualified teachers
- Offer thorough curriculum that meets academic standards
- Provide proper student support services
- Maintain effective learning technologies
- Continuously improve based on student outcomes

With Excel High School's Transfer & College Acceptance Guarantee, you can focus on learning with confidence, knowing your achievements will be recognised wherever your path leads after graduation.
