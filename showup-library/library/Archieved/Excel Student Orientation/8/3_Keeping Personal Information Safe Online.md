## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** Module 2, Lesson 3

**Lesson Title:** Protecting Your Digital Identity: Staying Safe Online

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Create strong, unique passwords to protect their online accounts
- Implement strategies to safeguard personal information while browsing the internet
- Explain how Excel High School's Acceptable Use Policy relates to online safety practices

Most of us spend hours online every dayâ€”scrolling through social media, completing schoolwork, or chatting with friends. While the internet connects us in amazing ways, it also exposes our personal information to potential risks. This lesson will give you practical tools to protect your digital identity, which will help you stay safe during your studies and beyond.

### Core Concept 1: Password Safety Tips

Your passwords are the keys to your digital life. Creating strong, unique passwords is your first line of defence against unauthorised access to your accounts. Here's how to create passwords that actually work:

1. **Length and Complexity:** Use passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, "Blue$kyTree42!" is much stronger than "password123".

2. **Uniqueness Matters:** Use a different password for each account. This way, if one account is compromised, your other accounts remain secure. This is especially important for your Excel High School account, which contains your educational records.

3. **Avoid Personal Information:** Don't use easily guessable information like your birthday, name, or common words. Hackers (people who try to break into online accounts) often try these first.

4. **Consider Passphrases:** A string of random words with numbers and symbols can be both secure and memorable. For example: "Horse-Battery-Staple-42!"

5. **Password Managers:** These tools can generate and securely store complex passwords for all your accounts, so you only need to remember one main password.

6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, like a code sent to your phone.

7. **Regular Updates:** Change your passwords periodically, especially if you suspect an account may have been compromised.

Following these practices significantly reduces the risk of someone gaining unauthorised access to your accounts and personal information.

### Core Concept 2: Protecting Personal Data Online

Beyond password security, here are several strategies to safeguard your personal information while browsing the internet:

1. **Be Careful with Public Wi-Fi:** Public networks (like those in coffee shops or libraries) are often unsecured. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (like banking or your coursework) when using public Wi-Fi. If necessary, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for added security. A VPN creates a secure connection that protects your data.

2. **Look for HTTPS:** Before entering any personal information on a website, check that the URL begins with "https://" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.

3. **Think Before You Share:** Be mindful about what personal information you share on social media. Adjust your privacy settings to control who can see your posts and profile information.

4. **Watch Out for Phishing Attempts:** Be wary of unexpected emails or messages asking for personal information. Legitimate organisations (including Excel High School) will never ask for your password via email. Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into revealing personal information.

5. **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your devices' operating systems, browsers, and applications. These updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

6. **Use Privacy Settings:** Get to know and use the privacy settings on your devices and the platforms you use.

7. **Data Minimisation:** Only provide necessary information when signing up for online services. If a field isn't required, consider leaving it blank.

These practices create multiple layers of protection for your personal data, making it significantly harder for others to access your information without permission.

### Core Concept 3: Excel High School's Acceptable Use Policy

Excel High School's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is designed to create a safe online learning environment for all students. Understanding how this policy relates to online safety is important:

1. **Responsible Use:** The AUP outlines expectations for using Excel High School's technology resources responsibly. This includes not sharing your account credentials, avoiding inappropriate content, and respecting others online.

2. **Privacy Protection:** The policy explains that while Excel High School takes measures to protect student privacy, you also have an important part to play by following good security practices.

3. **Reporting Concerns:** If you encounter any online safety issues or witness violations of the AUP, the policy provides clear steps for reporting these concerns to school staff.

4. **Staff Oversight:** Excel High School staff may monitor network activity to maintain compliance with the AUP and to identify potential security risks. This oversight helps maintain a secure learning environment.

5. **Consequences:** The AUP outlines potential consequences for violations, emphasising the importance of digital responsibility.

6. **Educational Purpose:** Remember that Excel High School's technology systems are provided for educational purposes. Using them appropriately helps maintain their security and availability.

By following the online safety practices discussed here and adhering to the AUP, you contribute to a secure and positive online learning environment for yourself and your fellow students.

### Over to You:

1. Take a moment to evaluate your current password practices. What's one specific change you could make today to better protect your accounts?

2. Think about your social media presence. Is there any personal information you've shared that might be better kept private? How could you adjust your privacy settings to better protect this information?

3. How might the online safety practices we've discussed benefit you beyond your time at Excel High School?
