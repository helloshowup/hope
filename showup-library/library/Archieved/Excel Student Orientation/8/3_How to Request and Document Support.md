Starting at a new school with unique learning needs can feel overwhelming. Don't worry—we've got your back. At Excel High School, we're committed to helping you succeed in our online environment. Let's walk through how to request and document the academic support you need to thrive.

### Core Concept 1: Disclosure Process During Enrolment

The first step in receiving appropriate support is letting us know about your needs when you enrol. This early heads-up helps us prepare everything before you dive into your coursework.

During online enrolment, you'll see a section asking about learning accommodations or support. Here's what to keep in mind:

1. Be honest and thorough. The more we know, the better we can help.
2. If you're on the fence about disclosing something, go ahead and share it. We can always adjust your support later.
3. This information stays confidential and only goes to staff directly involved in your education.
4. After you disclose your needs, our Registrar will reach out about next steps, including how to submit documentation.

Remember, sharing your needs is completely your choice, but it's the most effective way to get the support you deserve under educational law.

### Core Concept 2: Acceptable Documentation

To provide proper accommodations, we need official documentation of your learning needs. We accept:

1. **Individualised Education Programme (IEP):** A document from your previous school detailing your specific learning needs and accommodations.

2. **504 Plan:** A plan outlining accommodations that help you fully access the curriculum.

3. **Professional Evaluation:** A recent assessment (typically within the last three years) from a qualified professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or learning specialist that details your diagnosis and recommended accommodations.

When submitting your paperwork:
- Make sure it's current and complete
- Include relevant medical information
- Provide contact details for the professionals who evaluated you

Don't have recent documentation? No problem. Contact our Registrar for guidance on getting an updated evaluation.

### Core Concept 3: Review Timeline and Outcomes

After submitting your documentation, here's what happens next:

1. **Initial Review (5-7 business days):** Our support team will confirm they received your documents and make sure everything needed is there.

2. **Follow-up:** If we need more information, we'll get in touch during this time.

3. **Decision (10-14 business days total):** Based on our review, we'll create a personalised support plan just for you.

Possible outcomes include:
- Full accommodation approval
- Partial approval with suggestions for additional support
- Request for more information or updated documentation
- Denial (rare cases where needs can't be met in our online setup)

We'll keep you posted via email throughout this process. Haven't heard from us when expected? Don't hesitate to ping the Registrar.
