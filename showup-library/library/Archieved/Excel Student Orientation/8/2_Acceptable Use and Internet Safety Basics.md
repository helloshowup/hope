# Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Basics

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 2

**Lesson Title:** Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Basics

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the educational purpose of Excel High School's technology systems
- Identify prohibited activities when using school technology resources
- Describe the technology safeguards and monitoring practices in place

### Core Concept 1: Educational Purpose of School Technology Systems

At Excel High School, the technology resources you access daily aren't just random digital tools—they're specifically designed to support your learning journey. Think of these systems as extensions of your virtual classroom.

These technology systems serve several key educational purposes:

1. **Access to learning materials:** Digital textbooks, research databases, and course content
2. **Communication:** Email and messaging systems to connect with teachers and staff
3. **Assignment completion:** Tools for writing papers, creating presentations, and submitting work
4. **Research:** Safe access to online information for projects and assignments
5. **Skill development:** Building digital literacy skills you'll need for university and careers

While you might occasionally need to check a personal email or reset a password, remember that school technology exists primarily for your education. When you log in to any Excel High School system, your main focus should be on activities that help you meet your learning goals.

### Core Concept 2: No Expectation of Privacy

When using Excel High School's technology, it's worth noting the privacy limitations. Simply put, when using school systems, you shouldn't expect privacy. This means:

- School administrators can monitor and review your online activities
- Your files, messages, and browsing history on school systems may be viewed by staff
- All activity on school networks can be logged and reviewed

This policy isn't about snooping—it exists to:
- Keep everyone safe online
- Maintain the educational focus of school resources
- Protect the school network from security threats
- Help identify any misuse of technology

A good rule of thumb: if you wouldn't be comfortable with a teacher looking over your shoulder at what you're doing, you probably shouldn't be doing it on school technology.

### Core Concept 3: Prohibited Activities and Technology Safeguards

To maintain a safe and productive learning environment, certain activities aren't allowed when using Excel High School technology. Understanding these boundaries will help you avoid problems and make the most of your digital learning experience.

**Key prohibited activities include:**

1. **Accessing inappropriate content:** This includes viewing, creating, or sharing material that is pornographic, violent, or promotes discrimination
2. **Cyberbullying:** Using technology to harass, threaten, or embarrass others
3. **Security violations:** Attempting to bypass filters, hack accounts, or access unauthorised areas
4. **Copyright infringement:** Illegally downloading or sharing protected content like music, films, or software
5. **Account sharing:** Giving your login credentials to others or using someone else's account
6. **Personal business:** Using school resources for commercial activities or personal gain

**How Excel High School protects you and its systems:**

To create a safe digital environment, the school uses several safeguards:

1. **Content filters:** Block access to inappropriate websites and content
2. **Monitoring systems:** Track network activity to identify potential misuse
3. **Firewalls:** Protective barriers that prevent unauthorised access to the network
4. **Staff oversight:** Teachers and IT personnel actively monitor technology use
5. **Regular updates:** Systems are updated to address new security concerns

These measures work together to create a secure learning environment where you can focus on your studies without unnecessary risks or distractions.

### Over to You:

1. How might the "no expectation of privacy" policy affect how you use school technology? What kinds of activities might you reconsider knowing that they could be monitored?

2. Think about a situation where a student might accidentally violate the acceptable use policy. What could they have done differently to avoid the problem?

3. How do these technology rules compare to rules you've encountered in other areas of your life? How might following these guidelines prepare you for university or workplace technology policies?
