## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 3

**Lesson Title:** Understanding FERPA and Your Privacy Rights

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Summarise the key rights provided by FERPA
- Identify situations when information can be shared without consent
- Explain how to submit a FERPA request at Excel High School

Who can see your grades? Who has access to your personal information? These aren't just random questionsâ€”they're at the heart of your privacy as a student. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of your educational records. Understanding this law matters because it directly affects how your personal information is handled throughout your high school journey. Let's explore your rights under FERPA, when your information might be shared, and how you can take control of your educational privacy at Excel High School.

### Core Concept 1: Your FERPA Rights

FERPA gives you and your parents specific rights regarding your educational records. These rights include:

1. **The right to inspect and review your records:** You can request to see any official records Excel High School keeps about you. The school must provide access within 45 days after receiving your request. These records include your grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, and other information the school maintains.

2. **The right to request changes to your records:** If you find information in your records that you believe is incorrect or misleading, you can ask Excel High School to correct it. While the school must consider your request, they aren't required to make the change if they disagree with your assessment.

3. **The right to control disclosure of your information:** In most cases, Excel High School needs written permission from you or your parents (if you're under 18) before sharing your educational records with anyone outside the school.

These rights give you access to your own information and some control over how it's shared. When you turn 18 or enter college (regardless of age), these rights transfer from your parents to you.

### Core Concept 2: When Your Information Can Be Shared

While FERPA generally requires your consent before sharing your information, there are some important exceptions. Excel High School can share your records without permission in these situations:

1. **School officials with legitimate educational interest:** Your teachers, counsellors, or administrators may access your records if they need the information to do their jobs.

2. **Other schools you're transferring to:** If you plan to change schools, Excel High School can send your records to your new school.

3. **Financial aid purposes:** Information can be shared to determine your eligibility for financial assistance.

4. **Accrediting organisations:** These organisations (groups that evaluate schools) help Excel High School maintain high educational standards.

5. **Health and safety emergencies:** If there's an urgent situation affecting your safety or the safety of others, relevant information may be shared with appropriate officials.

6. **Compliance with a court order or subpoena:** The school must generally try to notify you before releasing information in these legal cases.

7. **Directory information:** This includes basic details like your name, address, phone number, email, photo, dates of attendance, grade level, enrolment status, and participation in activities and sports. However, you have the right to request that Excel High School not disclose this information.

Understanding these exceptions helps you know when your information might be shared and why. Excel High School still aims to protect your privacy even in these situations and will only share what's necessary.

### Core Concept 3: How to Submit a FERPA Request

If you want to exercise your FERPA rights at Excel High School, here's what to do:

1. **Decide what you're requesting:** Are you asking to see your records, requesting changes, or controlling who can access your information?

2. **Contact the right person:** Reach out to Excel High School's Registrar's Office, which handles FERPA requests. You can do this through email, phone, or the student portal.

3. **Submit a written request:** Clearly state what you're asking for. For example: "I would like to review my complete educational record" or "I request that my directory information not be shared."

4. **Provide identification:** You'll need to verify your identity to make sure only authorised people can access or modify your records.

5. **Be patient but persistent:** Remember, Excel High School has up to 45 days to respond to requests to inspect records. If you don't hear back within a reasonable time, follow up politely.

6. **For record changes:** If you're requesting corrections, clearly explain what you believe is wrong and why. If the school denies your request, they must inform you of your right to a hearing to challenge their decision.

By following this process, you can actively manage your educational privacy at Excel High School.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your own educational records. What types of information would you be most concerned about keeping private? Why?

2. Consider the exceptions to FERPA's consent requirement. Can you think of a situation where one of these exceptions might actually benefit you as a student?

3. How might understanding your FERPA rights be useful after you graduate from Excel High School?

### Summary

FERPA is an important law that protects your privacy as a student at Excel High School. It gives you the right to see your records, request corrections, and control who has access to your personal information. While there are some exceptions that allow the school to share information without your permission, these are limited to specific situations that serve important educational or safety purposes. By knowing how to submit a FERPA request, you can take an active role in managing your educational privacy. These skills will be valuable not just during your time at Excel High School, but throughout your future educational and professional life.
