### Core Concept 1: Parent/Guardian Roles in Online Learning

Let's face it - nobody succeeds at online school completely on their own. At Excel High School, your parents/guardians and our dedicated coaches form your support team. Understanding how these support systems work will help you make the most of your online learning experience.

Parents and guardians play key roles in supporting your success at Excel High School. Their primary responsibilities include:

1. **Creating a Supportive Learning Space:** Your parent/guardian can help you set up a quiet, organised area at home dedicated to schoolwork. This space should be free from distractions and have everything you need to focus on your studies.

2. **Monitoring Progress via Parent Portal:** Excel High School gives parents access to the Parent Portal where they can see your grades, completed assignments, and overall progress in real-time. When your parents stay informed, they can celebrate your wins and help sort out any problems before they snowball.

3. **Ensuring Attendance Compliance:** While online learning offers flexibility, regular engagement is necessary for your success. Your parents can help you establish a consistent schedule for logging in and completing coursework.

4. **Encouraging Time Management:** The freedom of online learning comes with responsibility. Your parents can help you create and stick to a study schedule that balances schoolwork with other activities.

5. **Facilitating Communication:** Parents serve as an important bridge between you and the school. They can encourage you to reach out to teachers or coaches when needed and help keep communication flowing with Excel High School staff.

When parents fulfil these roles, they help build a strong foundation for your academic success online.

### Core Concept 2: Using the Parent Portal

The Parent Portal is a valuable resource that helps your parents stay connected to your education at Excel High School. Here's how it works:

1. **Accessing the Portal:** Parents receive login details when you enrol. If your parent hasn't received this information, they should contact Excel High School's IT support.

2. **Key Features:**
   - **Grade Book:** Shows your current grades and completed assignments
   - **Progress Reports:** Tracks your overall course completion and pacing
   - **Attendance Log:** Records your login frequency and time spent on coursework
   - **Communication Centre:** Allows messages between parents and teachers/staff

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Parents should aim to review the Portal at least weekly. This regular monitoring helps them provide support when you need it most.

4. **Setting Goals Together:** The information in the Portal can help you and your parents set achievable academic goals and track your progress over time.

When your parents actively use the Parent Portal, they become true partners in your education, able to provide encouragement and support at the right moments.

### Core Concept 3: Success and Academic Coach Support

Excel High School provides two types of coaches to support both you and your parents:

**Success Coaches:**
- Serve as your primary point of contact for non-academic concerns
- Help with course selection and graduation planning
- Provide guidance on time management and organisation skills
- Offer motivation and accountability check-ins
- Connect you and your parents with additional resources as needed

**Academic Coaches:**
- Focus on specific subject areas like maths, science, or English
- Provide one-on-one or small group tutoring sessions
- Help clarify difficult concepts or assignment instructions
- Offer strategies for tackling challenging coursework
- Work with your teachers to address specific learning needs

Both types of coaches are available through email, phone, and video conferencing. They work together with you, your parents, and your teachers to make sure you have the support you need to succeed.

### Over to You:

1. Think about your current study space at home. What three changes could you make to create a more effective learning environment? Discuss these ideas with your parent or guardian.

2. How might regular use of the Parent Portal by your parent/guardian benefit your academic progress? What conversations could this open up between you and your parents?
