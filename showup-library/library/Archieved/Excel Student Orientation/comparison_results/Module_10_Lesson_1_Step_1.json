Before diving into your coursework, it's important to ensure you have the fundamental digital skills needed to navigate our online learning environment. This lesson will help you identify the core digital competencies required for all EHS courses and provide a way to assess your readiness.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Defining Basic Digital Literacy for Excel High School\n\nBasic digital literacy at Excel High School refers to the essential technology skills you need to successfully participate in our online learning environment.

Without these competencies, completing coursework would be challenging, if not impossible. Think of digital literacy as the language you need to speak to communicate in the digital classroom environment.\n\nDigital literacy is not just about technical proficiency\u2014it's about developing the confidence and problem-solving abilities to adapt to new digital tools as they emerge. As you progress through your courses at EHS, your digital literacy skills will naturally expand and deepen.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Essential Digital Skills Checklist\n\nBefore beginning your coursework at Excel High School, ensure you can confidently perform the following essential digital tasks:\n\n**Navigating the Internet:**\n- Use a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to access websites\n- Navigate between multiple browser tabs and windows\n- Use search engines effectively to find information\n- Bookmark important websites for easy access\n- Complete online forms and navigate through multi-page processes\n- Understand basic internet safety practices\n\n**Email Communication:**\n- Create, send, and reply to email messages\n- Add recipients in the To, CC, and BCC fields appropriately\n- Create a clear subject line that summarizes your message\n- Compose professional email messages with proper formatting\n- Attach files to email messages (documents, images, etc.)\n- Download and save email attachments to your computer\n- Organize emails using folders or labels\n\n**Document Creation and Editing:**\n- Create new documents using word processing software (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or OpenOffice Writer)\n- Format text (change font, size, color, bold, italic, etc.)\n- Create bulleted and numbered lists\n- Insert and modify tables, images, and other elements\n- Save documents in appropriate file formats (.docx, .pdf, etc.)\n- Share documents electronically\n- Create basic spreadsheets to organize data\n- Create simple presentations with multiple slides\n\nThese skills represent the minimum technical requirements for success in your Excel High School courses.
