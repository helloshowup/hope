Regional accreditation is considered the gold standard for educational institutions and is the same type held by traditional brick-and-mortar schools.\n\nWhy does regional accreditation matter?\n- Credits from regionally accredited schools like Excel are more widely accepted by colleges and universities\n- Most four-year colleges and universities prefer or require regional accreditation\n- Regional accreditation typically involves more rigorous standards and evaluation\n\nThis regional accreditation eliminates concerns about your diploma's legitimacy, giving you confidence that your Excel High School education will be universally accepted and valued.\n\n### Real-World Impact on Your Future\n\nThe practical benefits of our accreditation extend to many aspects of your future:\n\n**College Admissions**: Admissions offices recognize Excel High School diplomas nationwide.

Excel High School alumni have gone on to attend prestigious universities, build successful careers, and achieve their personal and professional goals.\n\nOne recent graduate shared: \"When I applied to my top-choice university, I was worried they might question my online high school diploma. But thanks to Excel's accreditation, the admissions process was smooth, and I'm now studying engineering at my dream school.\"\n\n### Your Assurance of Quality Education\n\nWhen you see our accreditation seal, you're seeing evidence that your education meets established standards of excellence.
