Understanding the U.S. holiday calendar and how it affects your online school experience is super important for planning your study schedule. This lesson will walk you through the major holidays throughout the year, explain how holiday dates sometimes shift, and\u2014most importantly\u2014remind you that one of the best parts of online learning is that your coursework is always available, even during school holidays! Let's dive in and learn how to balance your studies with holiday breaks.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Major U.S. Holidays and Observance Dates\n\nThe United States celebrates several important holidays throughout the year. Here are the major ones you should know about:\n\n1. New Year's Day - January 1\n2. Martin Luther King Jr. Day - Third Monday in January\n3. Presidents' Day - Third Monday in February\n4. Memorial Day - Last Monday in May\n5. Independence Day - July 4\n6. Labor Day - First Monday in September\n7. Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples' Day - Second Monday in October\n8. Veterans Day - November 11\n9. Thanksgiving Day - Fourth Thursday in November\n10. Christmas Day - December 25\n\nNotice that some holidays always fall on the same date (like Christmas on December 25), while others are observed on specific days of the week (like Memorial Day on the last Monday in May). This is important to understand when planning your study schedule throughout the year.\n\nDuring these holidays, Excel High School's administrative offices will be closed, which means staff won't be available to answer questions or grade assignments. However, your courses will still be accessible\u2014more on that in Core Concept 3!\n\n### Core Concept 2: Weekend Holiday Observances Shifting to Weekdays\n\nWhat happens when a holiday falls on a weekend? Great question! For holidays with fixed dates (like Independence Day on July 4), the observance often shifts to a weekday when they fall on a weekend:\n\n- If a holiday falls on a Saturday, it's usually observed on the preceding Friday.\n- If a holiday falls on a Sunday, it's usually observed on the following Monday.\n\nFor example:\n- If July 4th lands on a Saturday, Excel High School would likely observe it on Friday, July 3rd.\n- If Christmas (December 25) falls on a Sunday, the school would likely observe it on Monday, December 26th.\n\nThis is important to know because it affects when school staff will be available to help you. Always check the official Excel High School calendar for the exact observance dates, as they may change from year to year.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Coursework Accessibility During School Closures\n\nHere's some great news about being an online student at Excel High School: Your coursework is ALWAYS accessible, even during holidays and school closures! This means:\n\n- You can log in to your student portal 24/7/365\n- All your course materials, readings, and assignments remain available\n- You can submit completed work at any time\n- You can continue learning at your own pace\n\nThis flexibility is one of the biggest advantages of online learning! It allows you to:\n- Catch up on assignments during a long holiday weekend if you've fallen behind\n- Work ahead before a holiday if you want to take time off\n- Create your own schedule that balances schoolwork with holiday celebrations\n\nJust remember: While your courses are always accessible, school staff won't be available to answer questions or grade assignments during official holidays. Plan accordingly by addressing any urgent questions before the holiday break begins.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your own study habits. How might you use the continuous access to coursework during holidays to your advantage? Would you prefer to work ahead before a holiday or use the holiday to catch up?\n\n2. Look at a calendar for this year. Find a holiday that falls on a weekend and determine which weekday it would likely be observed on. How might this affect your study schedule?\n\n3. What strategies could you use to ensure you stay on track with your coursework around major holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas when you might have family obligations?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. If Independence Day (July 4) falls on a Saturday this year, when would Excel High School likely observe it?\n   - A. Friday, July 3\n   - B. Monday, July 6\n   - C. Saturday, July 4\n   - D. Thursday, July 2\n\n2. During a school closure for Thanksgiving, what can you do as an Excel High School student?\n   - A. Attend live classes with teachers\n   - B. Access and submit coursework online\n   - C. Call the school office for immediate help\n   - D. Visit the physical campus\n\n3. Which of the following holidays always falls on a Monday?\n   - A.
