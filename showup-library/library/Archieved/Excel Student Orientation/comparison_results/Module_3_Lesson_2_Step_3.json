Answer each question honestly based on your circumstances, goals, and commitments.\n\n### Question 1: How many hours per week can you realistically dedicate to schoolwork?\n- A. 25+ hours per week\n- B. 15-24 hours per week\n- C. 10-14 hours per week\n- D. Less than 10 hours per week\n\n### Question 2: What is your primary goal for attending Excel High School?\n- A. Complete my diploma as quickly as possible\n- B. Balance education with other significant commitments\n- C. Take a few courses while focusing primarily on other responsibilities\n- D. Explore academic interests at my own pace\n\n### Question 3: Which best describes your current work situation?\n- A. I don't work or work very minimal hours\n- B. I work part-time (less than 30 hours per week)\n- C. I work full-time (30+ hours per week)\n- D. I have variable work hours that change frequently\n\n### Question 4: Do you have significant family or caregiving responsibilities?\n- A. No, I have minimal family responsibilities\n- B. Some, but they're manageable with planning\n- C. Yes, I have substantial family commitments\n- D. My family responsibilities vary significantly week to week\n\n### Question 5: How would you describe your preferred learning pace?\n- A. I prefer to immerse myself completely and progress quickly\n- B. I like a steady, consistent pace with regular progress\n- C. I need flexibility to adjust my pace based on other commitments\n- D. I prefer to take my time and not feel rushed\n\n## Your Results\n\n**Mostly A's: Full-Time Enrollment Recommended**\nYou appear to have the time, focus, and circumstances that align well with full-time enrollment. With 25+ hours available for schoolwork weekly and fewer competing responsibilities, you're positioned to make steady progress through your courses. Full-time students typically complete 5-6 credits per semester, allowing you to graduate more quickly. This option may also qualify you for certain financial aid programs that require full-time status.\n\n**Mostly B's: Full-Time Enrollment Possible, But Consider Your Limits**\nYou could succeed as a full-time student, but you'll need careful time management. Your other commitments are significant but manageable. Consider starting with full-time enrollment but be prepared to adjust if the workload becomes overwhelming. Remember that Excel High School offers flexibility if you need to modify your enrollment status.\n\n**Mostly C's: Part-Time Enrollment Recommended**\nYour current life circumstances suggest that part-time enrollment would be more sustainable. With significant work or family commitments, the reduced course load of part-time enrollment (typically 2-4 credits per semester) will help you balance your education with other responsibilities. This approach may take longer to complete your diploma, but it sets you up for success by matching your academic load to your available time and energy.\n\n**Mostly D's: Part-Time Enrollment with Reduced Course Load Recommended**\nYour variable schedule and commitments indicate that a highly flexible, reduced course load would be most appropriate. Starting with just 1-2 courses will allow you to establish sustainable study habits while managing your changing responsibilities. Excel High School allows up to 12 months per course, providing the flexibility you need. You can always increase your course load in future terms as you become more comfortable with the academic requirements.\n\n**Mixed Results:**\nIf your answers were evenly distributed, consider starting with part-time enrollment to establish your academic routine. You can always increase to full-time enrollment in future terms if you find you have more capacity than anticipated. Remember that success often comes from setting realistic expectations rather than overcommitting initially.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n**For Full-Time Students:**\n- Expect to dedicate 25+ hours weekly to coursework\n- Complete approximately 5-6 credits per semester\n- May qualify for more financial aid options\n- Can potentially graduate more quickly (12-18 months)\n- Requires strong time management skills\n\n**For Part-Time Students:**\n- More flexibility to balance school with work/family\n- Can take fewer courses at once (minimum of 1 course)\n- Typically complete 2-4 credits per semester\n- Longer overall time to graduation\n- Often better for students with significant external commitments\n\nRemember that at Excel High School, you can adjust your enrollment status if your circumstances change. The right choice is the one that sets you up for success given your unique situation.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBased on your results, schedule a conversation with an Excel High School academic advisor to discuss your specific situation and create an academic plan tailored to your needs and goals.",
