Watch for absolute terms: Be cautious of options containing words like \"always,\" \"never,\" or \"all.\" These are often (but not always) incorrect.\n\n5. Look for grammatical clues: The correct answer usually grammatically fits with the question stem.\n\n6. Manage your time wisely: Don't spend too long on any one question.

Look for qualifiers: Words like \"always,\" \"never,\" or \"sometimes\" can be clues to the correct answer.\n\n5. Manage your time wisely: Don't spend too long on any single question. If unsure, mark it for review and come back later.\n\n6. Review your answers: If time allows, double-check your responses, but be cautious about changing answers unless you're certain.\n\n7. Answer every question: In most cases, there's no penalty for guessing, so don't leave any blanks.\n\nBy applying these techniques, you'll approach multiple-choice exams with confidence and improve your chances of success.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Leveraging Rubrics for Writing Tasks\n\nWriting assignments are an important part of many Excel High School courses.

Improved outcomes: Students who carefully review rubrics tend to produce higher-quality work and earn better grades.\n\n5. Feedback interpretation: After receiving your grade, the rubric helps you understand your strengths and areas for improvement.\n\nTo make the most of rubrics:\n- Read them thoroughly before starting your assignment\n- Refer back to them throughout the writing process\n- Use them to proofread and edit your final draft\n\nBy integrating rubric review into your writing process, you'll enhance the quality of your work and likely see an improvement in your grades.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Navigating Digital Course Materials\n\nAt Excel High School, all course materials are provided digitally.
