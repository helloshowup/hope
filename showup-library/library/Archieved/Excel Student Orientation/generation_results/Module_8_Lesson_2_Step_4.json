The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects these rights. Understanding FERPA is crucial because it impacts how your personal information is handled and shared throughout your academic journey. This lesson will explore your rights under FERPA, situations where information can be shared without your consent, and how to exercise your rights at Excel High School. By knowing your privacy rights, you can take an active role in managing your educational information.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Key FERPA Rights\n\nFERPA provides students and parents with specific rights regarding educational records. These rights apply to all schools that receive federal funding, including Excel High School. The three fundamental rights under FERPA are:\n\n1. The right to inspect and review educational records: You have the right to see your official school records within 45 days of submitting a request. This includes grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, and other information maintained by the school.\n\n2. The right to request changes to records: If you believe information in your records is inaccurate or misleading, you can request that the school correct or amend the record. The school must consider your request, though they are not obligated to make the change if they disagree.\n\n3. The right to consent for release of information: Generally, Excel High School must have written permission from you or your parents (if you're under 18) before releasing information from your educational records to outside parties.\n\nThese rights ensure that you have access to your educational information and control over how it's shared. It's important to note that these rights transfer from parents to students when the student turns 18 or enters a postsecondary institution at any age.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Exceptions to Consent Requirement\n\nWhile FERPA generally requires consent for sharing educational records, there are some important exceptions. Excel High School can disclose information without consent in the following situations:\n\n1. School officials with legitimate educational interest: Teachers, administrators, or support staff who need to review records to fulfill their professional responsibilities.\n\n2. Other schools to which a student is transferring: If you decide to transfer to another school, Excel High School can send your records to that institution.\n\n3. Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes: This allows for necessary oversight of educational programs.\n\n4. Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid: This ensures that your financial aid applications can be processed efficiently.\n\n5. Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school: These studies must be for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests; administering student aid programs; or improving instruction.\n\n6. Accrediting organizations: To carry out their accrediting functions.\n\n7. To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena: The school must make a reasonable effort to notify you before complying unless the court order or subpoena prohibits such notification.\n\n8. Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies: This allows the school to quickly share information if there's an immediate threat to student safety.\n\n9. State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.\n\n10. Directory information: Schools may disclose, without consent, \"directory\" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow them to opt out of these disclosures.\n\nUnderstanding these exceptions helps you know when your information might be shared and why. It's a balance between protecting your privacy and allowing the school to operate effectively and safely.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Submitting a FERPA Request at Excel High School\n\nIf you want to exercise your FERPA rights at Excel High School, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the specific right you want to exercise (inspect records, request changes, or provide/revoke consent for release).\n\n2. Contact the Excel High School registrar's office. You can do this via email, phone, or through the student portal.\n\n3. For record inspection: Submit a written request clearly stating which records you want to review. The school will arrange access within 45 days.\n\n4. For record changes: Submit a written request clearly identifying the part of the record you want changed and specify why it's inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, they will notify you and advise you of your right to a hearing regarding the request.\n\n5. For consent to release information: Provide written consent specifying the records to be released, the purpose of the disclosure, and the party to whom the disclosure may be made. You can also use this process to revoke previously given consent.\n\n6. For opting out of directory information disclosure: Submit a written request to the registrar's office stating that you do not want your directory information shared.\n\nRemember, Excel High School staff are available to assist you with any questions about the FERPA request process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need clarification or guidance.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your own educational records. What types of information do you think are most important to keep private? Why?\n\n2. Consider the exceptions to FERPA's consent requirement. Can you think of a situation where one of these exceptions might be beneficial to you as a student?\n\n3. How might understanding your FERPA rights impact your decisions about sharing information during your time at Excel High School and beyond?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following is NOT a right provided by FERPA?\n   A. The right to inspect your educational records\n   B. The right to request changes to your records\n   C. The right to choose your own teachers\n   D. The right to consent for release of your information\n\n2. In which situation can Excel High School share your information without your consent?\n   A. When a local business requests student contact information for marketing purposes\n   B. When another student's parent requests your grades for comparison\n   C. When you're transferring to another school\n   D. When a newspaper requests information for a story about high-achieving students\n\n3. How long does Excel High School have to provide access to your records after receiving a FERPA request?\n   A. 24 hours\n   B. 7 days\n   C. 30 days\n   D. 45 days\n\n### Summary\n\nFERPA is a crucial law that protects your privacy rights as a student at Excel High School. It gives you the right to inspect your records, request changes, and control how your information is shared. While there are some exceptions that allow the school to share information without consent, these are limited to specific situations that balance privacy with necessary educational functions.

    "## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION\n\n**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 3\n\n**Lesson Title:** Understanding FERPA and Your Privacy Rights\n\n## LEARNING COMPONENTS\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\n- Summarize the key rights granted by FERPA\n- Identify exceptions when information can be shared without consent\n- Demonstrate how to submit a FERPA request at Excel High School\n\n### Introduction\n\nAs a student at Excel High School, your educational records contain important personal information. But who has access to these records? What control do you have over your own data? The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. Understanding FERPA is crucial for safeguarding your personal information and knowing your rights. In this lesson, we'll explore what FERPA means for you as an Excel High School student, including how to exercise your rights and when exceptions may apply.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Key FERPA Rights\n\nFERPA grants students (or parents/guardians of minor students) several important rights regarding their educational records:\n\n1. The right to inspect and review education records: You can request to see your records maintained by Excel High School. The school must provide access within 45 days of receiving a request.\n\n2. The right to request amendments: If you believe your records contain inaccurate or misleading information, you have the right to request changes. While the school isn't obligated to make every requested change, they must consider your request and inform you of their decision.\n\n3. The right to consent to disclosures: Generally, Excel High School needs your written permission (or your parent's if you're under 18) before releasing information from your educational records to outside parties.\n\nThese rights ensure transparency and give you control over your personal information. For example, if you notice an error in your transcript, you can request a correction. Or, if a potential employer asks for verification of your enrollment, the school would need your consent before sharing that information.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Exceptions to FERPA Consent Requirements\n\nWhile FERPA generally requires consent for sharing student information, there are some important exceptions:\n\n1. School officials with legitimate educational interest: Teachers, administrators, or other staff who need information to fulfill their professional responsibilities may access records without explicit consent.\n\n2. Transfer schools: If you apply to another school, Excel High School may send your records to that institution.\n\n3. Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes: This allows for necessary oversight of educational programs.\n\n4. Organizations conducting studies for or on behalf of the school: This exception enables educational research, but with strict controls on data use and protection.\n\n5. Accrediting organizations: To maintain Excel High School's accreditation status.\n\n6. Compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena\n\n7. Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies\n\n8. State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law\n\n9. Directory information: This includes details like your name, address, phone number, and dates of attendance. However, Excel High School must inform you about what they consider directory information and give you the opportunity to opt out of its release.\n\nIt's important to understand these exceptions so you're not caught off guard if information is shared without your explicit consent in these specific situations.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Submitting a FERPA Request at Excel High School\n\nIf you want to exercise your FERPA rights at Excel High School, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify your request type: Decide if you want to inspect records, request an amendment, or provide/revoke consent for disclosure.\n\n2. Contact the appropriate office: Reach out to the Excel High School Registrar's Office, which handles FERPA requests.\n\n3. Submit a written request: Your request should clearly state what you're asking for (e.g., \"I would like to inspect my full educational record\" or \"I request an amendment to my transcript to correct my graduation date\").\n\n4. Provide identification: You'll need to verify your identity to protect against unauthorized access to your records.\n\n5. Allow processing time: Remember, the school has up to 45 days to respond to record inspection requests.\n\n6. Follow up: If you don't receive a response within the expected timeframe, don't hesitate to follow up with the Registrar's Office.\n\nBy following this process, you ensure that your request is handled properly and in compliance with FERPA regulations.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your own educational records. What specific types of information do you think are most important to protect? Why?\n\n2. Consider the exceptions to FERPA consent requirements. Do you think these exceptions strike the right balance between privacy and necessary information sharing? Explain your reasoning.\n\n3. How might understanding your FERPA rights be useful in your future educational or professional endeavors?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following is NOT a right granted by FERPA?\n   A. The right to inspect your educational records\n   B. The right to request amendments to your records\n   C. The right to have all record requests granted without question\n   D. The right to consent to disclosures of your information\n\n2. In which situation would Excel High School NOT need your consent to share your educational information?\n   A. Sending your transcript to a college you're applying to\n   B. Providing your grades to your parents' employer\n   C. Sharing information with accrediting organizations\n   D. Giving your class schedule to a local business\n\n3. What's the maximum time Excel High School has to respond to a request to inspect records under FERPA?\n   A. 24 hours\n   B. 7 days\n   C. 30 days\n   D. 45 days\n\n### Summary\n\nFERPA is a crucial law that protects your privacy as a student at Excel High School.

While there are some exceptions that allow for necessary educational functions and safety measures, FERPA generally ensures that you have a say in how your personal educational data is handled.
