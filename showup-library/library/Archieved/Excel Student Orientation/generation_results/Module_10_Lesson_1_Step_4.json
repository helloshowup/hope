The sidebar navigation provides quick access to your calendar, grades, messages, and support resources.\n\nTake a moment to explore each section of your dashboard. Notice how hovering over elements often reveals additional information or options. Your dashboard is personalized based on your course enrollment, so what you see reflects your specific academic program at Excel High School.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Tracking Your Progress\n\nLearnStage provides robust tools to monitor your academic journey.
