Excel High School is nationally accredited by Cognia and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA-CESS), both recognized accrediting bodies. Our accreditation ensures that colleges and universities across the United States and internationally recognize and accept our credits and diplomas. In fact, Excel High School graduates have been accepted to hundreds of colleges and universities nationwide. However, as each institution maintains its own transfer policies, we recommend contacting your specific colleges of interest to confirm their credit acceptance policies.\n\n### 2. Can I change programs after I've enrolled?\n\nAbsolutely. We understand that educational needs can evolve. Students can upgrade or change their program at any time. If you wish to upgrade from a single course to a full diploma program, or switch between diploma tracks, simply contact our Student Services team. The cost difference between programs will be calculated, and you'll only pay the difference for an upgrade. Program changes are typically processed within 1-2 business days, allowing you to continue your educational journey with minimal disruption.\n\n### 3. What payment options are available for tuition?\n\nExcel High School offers several flexible payment options:\n- Full payment: Pay the entire tuition upfront and receive a discount\n- Monthly payment plans: Spread your tuition over affordable monthly installments\n- Quarterly payment plans: Make payments every three months\n- Third-party financing: We partner with several financing companies for those who qualify\n\nWe accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and electronic checks. There are no hidden fees, and all course materials are included in your tuition. Financial assistance may be available for qualifying students.\n\n### 4. How long will it take to complete my program?\n\nProgram completion time varies based on several factors:\n- Full diploma programs: Typically 1-4 years, depending on transfer credits and your pace\n- Individual courses: Can be completed in as little as 2-4 weeks or extended up to 12 months\n- Credit recovery: Often completed within 4-8 weeks per course\n\nExcel High School's self-paced model means you can accelerate through material you understand quickly or take more time with challenging concepts. There are no set semester dates or deadlines, allowing you to create a schedule that works for your life circumstances.\n\n### 5. What if I need to take a break from my studies?\n\nLife happens, and we understand that. Excel High School students can request a temporary hold on their account for up to 6 months if needed for personal circumstances, medical issues, or other significant life events. During this time, your account remains active, but the course completion timeline is paused. To request a hold, simply contact Student Services. If you need to withdraw completely, our refund policy applies based on your progress in the program.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n[<button>Tuition Page</button>](https://www.excelhighschool.com/tuition)\n[<button>Help Desk</button>](https://www.excelhighschool.com/help)\n[<button>Payment Portal</button>](https://www.excelhighschool.com/payments)\n\nStill have questions?
