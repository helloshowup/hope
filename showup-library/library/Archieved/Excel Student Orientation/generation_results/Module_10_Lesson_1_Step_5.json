To ensure you have a smooth learning experience, it's important to set up your digital environment correctly from the start. This lesson covers the essential productivity tools you'll need, limitations when using mobile devices, and how to configure your browser settings for optimal functionality. Taking a few minutes now to properly set up your technology will save you frustration later and help you focus on what matters most\u2014your education.\n\n## Required Productivity Tools\n\n### Microsoft Office or Google Workspace\nFor your coursework at Excel High School, you'll need access to word processing and spreadsheet software. You have two main options:\n\n1. **Microsoft Office Suite**\n   - Includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other applications\n   - Available as a paid subscription through Microsoft 365\n   - Free options:\n     - Office Online (web-based versions with limited functionality)\n     - Free for eligible students through your school email (check eligibility at [office.com/student](https://www.office.com/student))\n\n2. **Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)**\n   - Includes Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and other applications\n   - Completely free with a Google account\n   - Access at [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com)\n   - Works entirely in your web browser\n   - Automatically saves your work to Google Drive\n\n**Which should you choose?** Both options will work for your coursework. Google's tools are free and accessible from any device with internet access, while Microsoft Office may offer more advanced features. If you're already familiar with one system, it's usually best to continue using what you know.\n\n### File Compatibility\nWhen submitting assignments, please save documents in widely compatible formats:\n- Word documents: .docx or .pdf\n- Spreadsheets: .xlsx or .csv\n- Presentations: .pptx or .pdf\n\nThis ensures your instructors can open and review your work without technical issues.\n\n## Mobile Device Limitations\n\nWhile Excel High School's learning platform is accessible on smartphones and tablets, there are important limitations to be aware of:\n\n### View-Only Functionality\nMobile devices provide **view-only access** to most course materials. This means you can:\n- Read course content\n- Watch instructional videos\n- Review assignment instructions\n- Check grades and feedback\n\n### Key Limitations\nOn mobile devices, you **cannot**:\n- Take exams or quizzes\n- Complete certain interactive activities\n- Upload assignments through some submission portals\n- Access certain third-party resources\n\nFor these critical activities, you must use a laptop or desktop computer with a supported web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).\n\n### Best Practice\nUse mobile devices for reviewing content on the go, but plan to complete assignments and exams on a computer. This ensures you'll have full functionality and won't risk losing work or encountering technical problems during important assessments.\n\n## Enabling Pop-ups for External Resources\n\nMany courses at Excel High School incorporate external learning resources that open in pop-up windows.

From the Safari menu, select \"Preferences\"\n2. Click the \"Websites\" tab\n3. Select \"Pop-up Windows\" from the left sidebar\n4. When visiting the learning platform, change the setting to \"Allow\"\n\n### Testing Your Settings\nAfter enabling pop-ups, we recommend testing your settings by:\n1. Logging into your course\n2. Clicking on an external resource link\n3. Confirming the resource opens correctly in a new window\n\nIf you continue experiencing issues, please contact technical support for assistance.\n\n## Over to You\n1. Which productivity suite (Microsoft Office or Google Workspace) do you plan to use for your coursework, and why is this choice best for your specific situation?\n2. What strategy will you use to ensure you have access to a computer when you need to complete exams or important assignments?\n\n## Summary\nTo succeed in your Excel High School courses, you'll need access to productivity tools like Microsoft Office or Google Workspace, with free options available for both. Remember that mobile devices provide view-only access to course materials and cannot be used for exams or certain assignments. Finally, be sure to enable pop-ups in your browser to access all course resources.
