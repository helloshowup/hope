# What the Enrollment Agreement Covers – Part 1

# What the Enrolment Agreement Covers – Part 2

In Part 1, we looked at the purpose of the Enrolment Agreement and your financial commitments when joining Excel High School. Now let's dive into the rest of this document, focusing on attendance expectations, refund policies, and other key provisions that will affect your educational journey.

## Refund Policies and Limitations

The refund section is perhaps one of the most important parts of the Enrolment Agreement. Excel High School has specific guidelines about when and how refunds work if you decide to withdraw.

### The 10-Day Window

Excel High School gives you a 10-day window from the date you sign the Enrolment Agreement. If you decide during this period that the programme isn't right for you, you can request a full refund of your tuition. Keep in mind that a 3% processing fee will be deducted to cover administrative costs.

For instance, if you paid £1,200 in tuition and request a refund within the 10-day window, you'd receive £1,164 back (that's your £1,200 minus the 3% fee of £36).

### After the 10-Day Window

Once those 10 days have passed, the Enrolment Agreement clearly states that no refunds will be issued. This is something you really need to understand before signing. After this period ends, you're responsible for the full tuition amount, even if you:
- Decide to withdraw from the programme
- Stop participating in coursework
- Can't complete the programme for personal reasons

This policy highlights why you should carefully consider your commitment before enrolling. Are you confident in your decision and ready to follow through with your educational plan?

## Special Circumstances: State-Funded Programmes

The Enrolment Agreement includes a notable exception regarding state-funded programmes. If you're enrolling through a state-funded programme (like a public school partnership or state scholarship programme), different rules may apply.

In these cases, the Enrolment Agreement specifies that the rules and regulations of the state-funded programme take precedence over Excel High School's standard terms. This means if your state programme has different refund policies or attendance requirements, those will apply to your enrolment instead.

If you're joining through a state-funded programme, you should:
1. Get to know the specific rules of your state programme
2. Understand how these rules might differ from Excel High School's standard policies
3. Ask questions about anything that seems unclear before signing

## Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies

When you sign the Enrolment Agreement, you're also confirming that you've read and agree to follow Excel High School's Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies. These govern how you're expected to use the school's online systems.

The agreement includes a direct link to these policies, which cover important topics such as:
- Appropriate online behaviour and communication
- Prohibited activities when using school systems
- Protection of personal information
- Consequences for policy violations

As an online student, understanding these policies is necessary for maintaining a positive learning environment. Breaking these policies could potentially lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal from the programme.

## Over to You:

1. Why do you think Excel High School has a 10-day limit on refunds rather than a longer period? What factors might influence this policy?

2. If you were enrolled through a state-funded programme, what specific questions would you want to ask about how the programme's rules might differ from Excel High School's standard policies?

3. What responsibilities do you think come with agreeing to follow the Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies? Why are these policies particularly important in an online learning environment?

## Test Your Understanding

1. If you request a refund 12 days after signing the Enrolment Agreement, what should you expect?
   - A. A full refund of your tuition
   - B. A partial refund minus the 3% processing fee
   - C. A partial refund based on how many courses you've started
   - D. No refund will be issued

2. If you're enrolled through a state-funded programme and there's a conflict between state programme rules and Excel High School's standard policies, which takes precedence?
   - A. Excel High School's policies always take precedence
   - B. The rules of the state-funded programme take precedence
   - C. Whichever policy is more favourable to the student
   - D. A compromise between both sets of policies is negotiated

3. By signing the Enrolment Agreement, you confirm that you:
   - A. Have received all required course materials
   - B. Have read and agree to follow the Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies
   - C. Will maintain a specific grade point average
   - D. Will participate in all school events and activities

## Summary

The Enrolment Agreement at Excel High School contains critical information about refund policies, with a clear 10-day window for receiving a refund (minus a 3% processing fee) and no refunds available after this period. Special provisions apply for students in state-funded programmes, where state rules may override standard school policies. Additionally, by signing the agreement, you commit to following the school's Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies. Taking time to understand these aspects before signing ensures you're fully informed about your rights and responsibilities as an Excel High School student.
