# Next Steps Checklist – Part 2

# Next Steps Checklist – Part 2

Now you've completed the first part of your enrolment process, it's time to build some good habits for success at Excel High School. This second part of your Next Steps Checklist focuses on creating a study routine that works for you and making sure your enrolment file is complete. Taking these steps now will help you stay on track and avoid administrative delays.

## Setting Weekly Study Targets

### Why Weekly Targets Matter
In an online learning environment without daily classroom attendance, creating your own structure makes all the difference. Students who establish regular study patterns typically complete their courses on time and achieve better grades.

### Creating Your Study Schedule
Completing 1-2 lessons per course each week allows you to make steady progress while maintaining quality work. Here's how to create an effective weekly study plan:

1. **Find your best study times**: Are you more focused in the morning, afternoon, or evening?
2. **Block specific study sessions**: Choose exact days and times for studying each course
3. **Be realistic**: Consider your other responsibilities and set targets you can consistently achieve
4. **Start small**: Begin with 1 lesson per week per course and adjust as you establish your routine

### Setting Up Calendar Reminders
Calendar reminders serve as your personal accountability system. Here's how to set them up effectively:

1. Choose a calendar system you already use regularly (phone, computer, or physical planner)
2. Create recurring events for each study session with specific course names
3. Set alerts 15-30 minutes before your scheduled study time
4. Include notes about which specific lesson you plan to work on
5. Add a weekly review reminder to check your overall progress

Most high school students find success using apps like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar since these sync across all your devices and send notifications. The trick is picking something you'll actually look at regularly.

## Completing Your Enrolment File

### Required Documentation Checklist
Verify that you have uploaded:
- **Official transcripts** from all previous schools
- **Government-issued photo ID** (driver's licence, passport, etc.)
- **Proof of residence** (if required for your programme)
- **Enrolment agreement** with all signatures
- **Payment information** or financial aid documentation

Having a complete enrolment file ensures that:
- Your academic records are properly maintained
- Your credits are accurately recorded
- Your diploma or transcript requests can be processed without delay
- You have access to all student services

### How to Upload Missing Documents
If you're missing any required documentation:
1. Log in to your Excel High School student portal
2. Navigate to the "My Documents" section
3. Select "Upload Document"
4. Choose the appropriate document type from the dropdown menu
5. Upload your file (PDF, JPG, or PNG formats work best)
6. Verify the upload was successful
