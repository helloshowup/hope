# Signing the Agreement

## Understanding Your Enrolment Agreement

Before continuing with your orientation, you need to review and sign the Student Enrolment Agreement. This document outlines the terms between you and Excel High School, including your rights and responsibilities as a student.

The Student Enrolment Agreement is a legally binding document that covers several important areas:

### Tuition and Financial Policies

This section outlines your financial commitment, payment schedule, and available payment options.

The agreement specifies:
- Your total programme cost
- Payment plan options (if applicable)
- Due dates for payments
- Late payment policies and fees

Take time to review the exact costs associated with your programme. If you have questions about affordability or payment options, contact our Financial Services team before signing.

### Attendance and Academic Expectations

This section explains what Excel High School expects regarding your participation and academic progress.

Key points include:
- Minimum login and participation requirements
- Course completion timeframes
- Academic integrity standards (rules about honest work)
- Consequences of extended inactivity
- How to request extensions or leaves of absence

Regular engagement with course materials plays a key role in your success in this online learning environment.

### Data Privacy and Information Handling

This section explains how Excel High School collects, uses, and protects your personal information.

The agreement covers:
- Types of personal information collected
- How your information is used and stored
- Third parties who may access your information
- Your rights regarding your personal data
- How to request changes to your information

Excel High School is committed to protecting your privacy while providing quality education services. We comply with all applicable education privacy laws, including FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act).

## Required Acknowledgments

Before finalising your enrolment, please review and acknowledge the following specific policies by checking each box:

### Refund Policy Acknowledgment

□ **I understand and agree to Excel High School's refund policy.**

Our refund policy provides a full refund (minus 3% fee) if you withdraw within 10 days of enrolment, and no refund after 10 days. State-funded programme rules may override these terms when applicable.

Understanding this policy is important before making your financial commitment to Excel High School.

### Credit Transfer Guarantee Acknowledgment

□ **I understand Excel High School's credit transfer policies and guarantees.**

While Excel High School is fully accredited, the acceptance of transfer credits is always at the discretion of the receiving institution. This means we cannot guarantee that all credits will transfer to all institutions.

### Acceptable Use Policy Acknowledgment

□ **I have read and agree to abide by Excel High School's Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies.**

These policies outline appropriate online behaviour, digital citizenship expectations, and consequences for policy violations.
