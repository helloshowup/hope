# Meet Your Support Network

# Meet Your Support Network

Starting a new online high school programme can feel like a mix of excitement and uncertainty. But here's the thing—you're never alone on this journey. Students who connect early with available support tend to do much better in their courses. Let's explore the support network you'll have as an Excel High School student.

## Your Academic Support Team

Excel High School has built a support system specifically with online high school students in mind. Your support includes three main pillars:

### Success Coaches
Your Success Coach serves as your primary contact and personal guide throughout your time at Excel High School. They will:
- Help you navigate the online learning platform
- Create a personalised academic plan that fits your goals
- Check in regularly to make sure you're progressing well
- Provide strategies for effective online learning
- Connect you with additional resources when needed

Think of your Success Coach as your personal navigator through high school. They understand the challenges teens face in online learning and will help you develop the time management and study skills you need to thrive. You'll be assigned a Success Coach when you enrol, and they'll reach out to welcome you within your first week.

### Academic Coaching
When you run into challenging subjects or difficult concepts, Academic Coaches provide subject-specific support. They can:
- Offer one-on-one tutoring in specific subjects
- Help explain complex topics in ways that make sense to you
- Provide feedback on assignments before submission
- Share study strategies for tests and quizzes

How do you connect with an Academic Coach? Simply go to the "Academic Support" section in your student portal and request a coaching session in your subject area.

### Career & College Counselling
As you progress through high school, Career and College Counsellors help you prepare for your future by:
- Guiding you through the college application process
- Helping you explore potential career paths
- Assisting with scholarship searches and applications
- Supporting CV development and interview preparation
- Connecting your current coursework to future goals

These services help ensure your Excel High School education connects meaningfully to your plans after graduation. You can schedule appointments with counsellors through the "Future Planning" section of your portal.
