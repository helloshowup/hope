# What the Enrollment Agreement Covers – Part 2

<Analysis>
I've identified several AI patterns in this text that need humanizing for high school students:

1. The introduction is formal and lacks engagement - I'll replace it with a more direct, conversational opening
2. Replaced "essential" with more natural alternatives
3. Changed American spelling to British (e.g., behavior → behaviour)
4. Made language more accessible for 14-18 year olds while maintaining professionalism
5. Added more varied sentence structures and conversational elements
6. Renamed "Think About It" section to "Over to You" as requested
7. Made the tone more personal and relatable without losing educational value
8. Reduced repetitive phrasing and overly formal explanations

# What the Enrolment Agreement Covers – Part 2

Continuing our look at the Enrolment Agreement, we now turn to several key aspects that will directly affect your time at Excel High School. Before signing any educational contract, you should fully understand the refund policy, special programme provisions, and acceptable use policies. These elements protect both you and the school by setting clear expectations from the start.

## Refund Policy and Timeframe

The refund policy is something you'll want to pay close attention to. Excel High School's policy includes:

- **10-Day Refund Window**: After you enrol, you have 10 days to request a full refund if you decide the programme isn't right for you.
- **Processing Fee**: Any refund within this 10-day window will have a 3% processing fee deducted to cover transaction costs.
- **No Refunds After 10 Days**: Once the 10-day period ends, no refunds will be given for any reason, regardless of how much coursework you've completed.

This 10-day window starts on your enrolment date, not from your first login. For instance, if you enrol on 1st January, your refund window would close at the end of 11th January. This gives you time to explore your courses while allowing the school to plan accordingly.

## State-Funded Programme Exceptions

While most students follow standard policies, different rules may apply if you're enrolled through a state-funded programme:

- **Policy Override**: If you're participating in a state-funded programme (like a public school district partnership or state scholarship programme), that programme's rules might override Excel High School's standard terms.
- **Different Requirements**: State-funded programmes often have their own refund policies, attendance requirements, and completion timelines.
- **Programme-Specific Guidelines**: Your Enrolment Agreement will mention any applicable state programme and note where those specific guidelines take precedence.

If you're unsure whether your enrolment falls under a state-funded programme, contact your admissions counsellor or academic advisor before signing. They can explain which specific rules apply to your situation and provide any additional documentation you might need.

## Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies

By signing the Enrolment Agreement, you confirm that you've read, understood, and agree to follow Excel High School's Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies. These cover:

- Appropriate online behaviour and communication
- Proper use of Excel High School's digital resources and platforms
- Protection of personal information and account security
- Prohibited activities such as plagiarism, harassment, or unauthorised sharing of materials
- Consequences for policy violations

You can access the full text of these policies through a link in your Enrolment Agreement. Take time to review these documents thoroughly before signing, as violations can result in consequences ranging from warnings to dismissal depending on severity.

Remember that your digital interactions in an online learning environment are just as important as in-person classroom behaviour, and professional, respectful conduct is expected at all times.

## Over to You

1. Why do you think Excel High School offers a 10-day refund window rather than a longer or shorter period? How might this timeframe affect both students and the school?

2. If you were enrolled through a state-funded programme, what specific questions would you want to ask about how the programme's rules might differ from standard policies?

3. Which aspects of the Acceptable Use and Internet Safety Policies do you think matter most for creating a positive online learning environment?
