As a high school student navigating online education, having the right support can make all the difference in your academic journey. Think of your Success Coach as your personal guide - someone who's there to help you stay on track, overcome challenges, and prepare for your future. This lesson explores the different coaching tiers available to you, compares their benefits, and shows you exactly how to connect with your Success Coach when you need guidance. Let's discover how ElevatED Coaching can help you achieve your academic and career goals!\n\n### Core Concept 1: ElevatED Coaching Tiers\n\nExcel High School offers three distinct ElevatED Coaching tiers, each designed to provide different levels of support based on your individual needs:\n\n1. **Launch Tier**: This entry-level tier is perfect for self-motivated students who need occasional guidance. With monthly check-ins, your Success Coach will help you stay on track with your coursework and provide basic academic support when needed.\n\n   *\"The Launch tier helped me establish a good routine for my classes. My monthly check-ins keep me accountable, but I still have the independence I want.\"* - Alex, Grade 10\n\n2. **Climb Tier**: Designed for students seeking more regular support, the Climb tier offers bi-weekly (twice a month) coaching sessions. These sessions focus on developing study skills, time management strategies, and addressing specific academic challenges you may face.\n\n   *\"When I was struggling with my science courses, upgrading to the Climb tier made a huge difference. My coach helped me develop better study habits and we meet often enough that I never fall behind.\"* - Jordan, Grade 11\n\n3. **Summit Tier**: Our most comprehensive option, the Summit tier provides weekly one-on-one coaching sessions. This intensive support covers everything from detailed academic planning to in-depth career exploration and college preparation.\n\n   *\"As a senior preparing for college applications, the Summit tier has been invaluable. My weekly sessions keep me focused on both my current classes and my future goals.\"* - Taylor, Grade 12\n\nEach tier builds upon the previous one, offering increasingly personalized and frequent interactions with your Success Coach to match your individual needs and goals.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Comparing Tier Benefits\n\nTo help you understand which coaching tier might be right for you, let's compare their key benefits:\n\n| Feature | Launch | Climb | Summit |\n|---------|--------|-------|--------|\n| Coaching Sessions | Monthly | Bi-weekly (twice a month) | Weekly |\n| Response Time | 48 hours | 36 hours | 24 hours |\n| Academic Planning | Basic course selection | Detailed study plans | Comprehensive academic roadmap |\n| Career Exploration | Self-guided resources | Guided assessments | In-depth exploration and planning |\n| College Prep | General information | Application guidance | Detailed college planning and essay review |\n| Study Skills Support | Basic resources | Personalized strategies | Intensive skill development |\n\nFor example, if you're struggling with time management in your Algebra course:\n- With **Launch**, you might receive links to helpful time management resources during your monthly check-in\n- With **Climb**, your coach might create a bi-weekly study schedule specifically for your math assignments\n- With **Summit**, your coach would meet with you weekly to review your progress, adjust your study techniques, and provide ongoing personalized support\n\nRemember, you can always change your coaching tier if your needs change throughout the school year.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Contacting Your Success Coach\n\nKnowing how to reach your Success Coach is essential for getting timely support. Excel High School uses a Help Desk ticket system to ensure all students receive prompt assistance.\n\nFollow these steps to contact your Success Coach:\n\n1. Log in to your Excel High School student portal\n2. Click on the \"Help Desk\" icon in the main navigation menu\n3. Select \"Create New Ticket\"\n4. From the dropdown menu, choose \"ElevatED Coaching\"\n5. Select a subject that best describes your need (e.g., \"Schedule a Coaching Session\")\n6. Write a clear, specific message explaining what you need help with\n7. Click \"Submit Ticket\"\n\n**Example of an effective Help Desk ticket:**\n\nSubject: Request for Help with English Essay Assignment\n\nMessage: \"Hello! I'm working on my analytical essay for English 10, and I'm having trouble developing my thesis statement. Could we schedule a coaching session this week to review my outline and discuss how to strengthen my main argument? I'm available after 3 PM on Tuesday or Thursday. Thank you!\"\n\nYour Success Coach will respond within the timeframe specified for your coaching tier (see the comparison chart above). For urgent matters, you can mark your ticket as \"High Priority,\" but please reserve this for true time-sensitive issues.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Based on what you've learned about the three coaching tiers, which one do you think would best support your current academic needs and goals? Explain your reasoning.\n\n2. Think about a specific academic challenge you're facing right now (or anticipate facing this semester). How might you use the Help Desk system to request assistance from your Success Coach? Draft a brief message you might send.\n\n3. How do you think regular coaching sessions could help you achieve your long-term goals after high school?
