This lesson explores the important roles that parents/guardians play in creating an effective learning environment at home, how they can use the Parent Portal to stay connected with your progress, and how our Success Coaches and Academic Coaches are ready to help both you and your parents navigate your educational journey.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Parent/Guardian Roles in Online Learning\n\nParents and guardians play vital roles in supporting your success at Excel High School. Their primary responsibilities include:\n\n1. **Creating a Supportive Learning Space:** Your parent/guardian can help you establish a quiet, organized area at home dedicated to schoolwork. This space should be free from distractions (like TV or gaming consoles) and equipped with the materials and technology you need to succeed.\n\n2. **Monitoring Progress via Parent Portal:** Excel High School provides parents with access to the Parent Portal, where they can view your grades, assignment completion status, and overall progress in real-time. When your parents stay informed, they can celebrate your successes and help address any challenges before they become bigger issues.\n\n3. **Ensuring Attendance Compliance:** While online learning offers flexibility, consistent engagement is crucial for your success. Your parents can help you establish a regular schedule for logging in and completing coursework to meet attendance requirements.\n\n4. **Encouraging Time Management:** The freedom of online learning comes with responsibility. Your parents can help you create and maintain a study schedule that balances schoolwork with other activities and responsibilities.\n\n5. **Facilitating Communication:** Parents serve as an important bridge between you and the school.

This regular monitoring helps them provide timely support when needed.\n\n4. **Setting Goals Together:** The information in the Portal can help you and your parents set achievable academic goals and track your progress over time.\n\nWhen your parents actively use the Parent Portal, they become true partners in your education, able to provide encouragement and support exactly when you need it.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Success and Academic Coach Support\n\nExcel High School provides two types of coaches to support both you and your parents:\n\n**Success Coaches:**\n- Serve as your primary point of contact for non-academic concerns\n- Help with course selection and graduation planning\n- Provide guidance on time management and organization skills\n- Offer motivation and accountability check-ins\n- Connect you and your parents with additional resources as needed\n\n**Academic Coaches:**\n- Specialize in specific subject areas like math, science, or English\n- Provide one-on-one or small group tutoring sessions\n- Help clarify difficult concepts or assignment instructions\n- Offer strategies for tackling challenging coursework\n- Work with your teachers to address specific learning needs\n\nBoth types of coaches are available through email, phone, and video conferencing. They work together with you, your parents, and your teachers to ensure you have the support you need to succeed.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your current study space at home.
