Excel High School is committed to providing the support you need to succeed in our online learning environment. This lesson will guide you through the process of requesting and documenting academic support, ensuring you have the tools and accommodations necessary for your educational journey. Understanding this process is crucial for setting yourself up for success from day one. Let's explore how to effectively communicate your needs and work with our team to create an optimal learning environment for you.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Disclosure Process During Enrollment\n\nThe first step in receiving appropriate support at Excel High School is disclosing your needs during the enrollment process. This early disclosure allows us to prepare and implement necessary accommodations before you begin your coursework.\n\nDuring online enrollment, you'll encounter a section asking about any learning accommodations or support you may require. Here's what you should know:\n\n1. Be honest and thorough in your responses. The more information you provide, the better we can assist you.\n2. If you're unsure whether to disclose, it's better to share. We can always adjust the level of support later.\n3. This information is confidential and will only be shared with staff directly involved in supporting your education.\n4. After initial disclosure, our Registrar will reach out to guide you through the next steps, including documentation submission.\n\nRemember, disclosing your needs is entirely voluntary, but it's the best way to ensure you receive the support you're entitled to under educational law.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Acceptable Documentation\n\nTo provide appropriate accommodations, Excel High School requires official documentation of your learning needs. Acceptable forms of documentation include:\n\n1. **Individualized Education Program (IEP):** A document detailing your specific learning needs and accommodations from your previous school.\n\n2. **504 Plan:** A plan that outlines accommodations for students who need support to access the curriculum fully.\n\n3. **Professional Evaluation:** A recent assessment (typically within the last three years) from a qualified professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or learning specialist detailing your diagnosis and recommended accommodations.\n\nWhen submitting documentation:\n- Ensure it's current and complete\n- Include any relevant medical information\n- Provide contact information for the professionals involved in your evaluation\n\nIf you don't have recent documentation, contact our Registrar for guidance on obtaining an updated evaluation.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Review Timeline and Outcomes\n\nOnce you've submitted your documentation, here's what you can expect:\n\n1. **Initial Review (5-7 business days):** Our support team will confirm they received your documents and check to make sure all necessary information is there.\n\n2. **Follow-up:** If we need additional information, we'll contact you during this timeframe.\n\n3. **Decision (10-14 business days total):** Based on the evaluation, we'll create a personalized support plan.\n\nPossible outcomes include:\n- Full accommodation approval\n- Partial approval with suggestions for additional support\n- Request for more information or updated documentation\n- Denial (in rare cases where needs can't be met in our online environment)\n\nThroughout this process, we'll keep you informed via email. If you haven't heard from us within the expected timeframe, don't hesitate to reach out to the Registrar.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your own learning style. What types of support or accommodations have been helpful for you in the past?\n\n2. How might the process of requesting support differ in an online school compared to a traditional brick-and-mortar school?\n\n3. Why is it important to be proactive about disclosing your support needs when enrolling at Excel High School?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following is NOT considered acceptable documentation for requesting support at Excel High School?\n   A. A current IEP from your previous school\n   B. A note from a parent describing your needs\n   C. A 504 Plan\n   D. A recent professional evaluation\n\n2. How long does the initial review of support documentation typically take?\n   A. 1-2 business days\n   B. 5-7 business days\n   C. 2-3 weeks\n   D. 1 month\n\n3. Who should you contact first if you have questions about the support request process?\n   A. Your teachers\n   B. The school principal\n   C. The Registrar\n   D. Other students\n\n### Summary\n\nRequesting and documenting support at Excel High School follows a clear process designed to ensure you receive the accommodations you need to succeed academically.
