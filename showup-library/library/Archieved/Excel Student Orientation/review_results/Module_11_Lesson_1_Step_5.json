Creating a personalized payment plan helps you gain experience in financial planning while staying on track with your educational commitments. This tool lets you see exactly how your payments will work over time, helping you make smart decisions about your education costs. Understanding the financial side of your education gives you control over your academic journey and prepares you for future financial responsibilities.\n\n## Creating Your Personalized Payment Plan\n\nThe Payment Calculator helps you visualize and plan for the financial commitment of your educational program. This tool turns numbers into a clear payment schedule made specifically for your situation.\n\n### How to Use the Payment Calculator\n\n1. **Select Your Program**: Choose from the dropdown menu of available programs.

This will be the starting point for your payment schedule.\n\n3. **Review Payment Options**: The calculator will show several payment plan choices:\n   - Full payment (with discount)\n   - Monthly payment plan (showing number of payments and amount)\n   - Quarterly payment plan (showing payment dates and amounts)\n\n4. **Customize Your Plan**: Change options like down payment amount or payment frequency to see how they affect your overall schedule.\n\n5. **View Your Schedule**: The calculator will create a complete month-by-month breakdown of:\n   - When payments are due\n   - How much each payment will be\n   - How much you'll still owe after each payment\n   - How much you've paid so far\n\nThis visual breakdown helps you understand exactly when payments are due and how each payment contributes to your education costs.\n\n## Exploring Financial Scenarios\n\nFinancial planning isn't just about creating an ideal schedule\u2014it's about preparing for real-life situations. The scenario exploration feature helps you understand what happens in common financial circumstances.\n\n### What Happens If You Miss Payments?\n\nUse the \"Missed Payments\" scenario tool to see how your payment plan would change if you couldn't make payments for a period of time.
