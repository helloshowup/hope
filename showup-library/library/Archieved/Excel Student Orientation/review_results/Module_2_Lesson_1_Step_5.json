It's like being \"protected\" from certain changes that happen after you've started your educational journey at Excel High School.\n\n**Why Does This Matter to You?**  \nAs a student at Excel High School, grandfather clauses directly affect your graduation requirements and academic experience. Understanding these policies helps you:\n- Know exactly what you need to graduate\n- Plan your courses with confidence\n- Avoid confusion when school policies change\n\n**How Grandfather Clauses Work at Excel High School:**\n\n1. **Graduation Requirements**  \n   If you enrolled before August 2023, you'll follow the graduation requirements that were in place when you started. For example:\n   - If you enrolled in 2021, you need 21 total credits to graduate\n   - If you enrolled in 2023, you need 24 total credits to graduate\n   - Both students can still earn the same diploma!\n\n2. **Course Requirements**  \n   When Excel High School updates which specific courses are required:\n   - You follow the course list from when you enrolled\n   - Your transcript and graduation plan reflect your specific requirements\n   - Your academic advisor can help you understand your personal requirements\n\n3. **Tuition and Fees**  \n   If you enrolled under a specific tuition plan, you'll generally continue with that plan as long as you remain continuously enrolled.\n\n**Real-Life Example:**  \nIn 2022, Excel High School updated its math requirements to include statistics. Students who enrolled before this change can still follow their original math sequence, while new students must follow the updated requirements.\n\n**Your Responsibilities:**\n- Keep track of your specific graduation requirements\n- Maintain continuous enrollment to preserve your grandfather status\n- Consult with your academic advisor if you're unsure about which policies apply to you\n\n**When Grandfather Clauses Don't Apply:**\n- School-wide technology updates\n- Changes required by law or accreditation\n- Behavioral policies and student conduct expectations\n\n**Have Questions?**  \nIf you're ever confused about which policies apply to you:\n1. Check your student portal for your personalized graduation requirements\n2. Contact your academic advisor for clarification\n3. Email the registrar's office with specific questions about your status\n\nGrandfather clauses are an important part of navigating your high school experience successfully. These policies ensure that you can progress toward graduation with confidence, even as Excel High School continues to improve its programs for future students.",
