  "edit_summary": "- Simplified some technical language in the Success Coach segment (changed \"articulation agreements\" to \"agreements with universities\" and \"transfer seamlessly\" to \"transfer smoothly\")\n- Modified the call-to-action language to be more direct and age-appropriate (\"accelerate your educational journey\" changed to \"get ahead in your education\")\n- Replaced complex phrasing with more straightforward alternatives that maintain the same meaning (e.g., \"simultaneously\" to \"at the same time\")\n- Kept the core content intact while making the language more accessible to high school students aged 14-18\n- Preserved all key information and messaging points while reducing potential vocabulary barriers"
