These digital resources are powerful assets for your education, but they come with important responsibilities. This lesson will guide you through the basics of acceptable use and internet safety at our school.\n\nUnderstanding these guidelines isn't just about following rules\u2014it's about creating a positive online learning environment where you can succeed academically while staying safe. You'll learn how to use school technology appropriately, what activities to avoid, and how the school helps protect you online.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Educational Purpose of School Technology Systems\n\nExcel High School provides technology resources specifically to support your academic success. Think of these digital tools as extensions of your classroom\u2014they're designed to help you learn, not just for entertainment.\n\nThese technology systems serve several important educational purposes:\n\n1. **Access to learning materials:** Digital textbooks, research databases, and course content\n2. **Communication:** Email and messaging systems to connect with teachers and staff\n3. **Assignment completion:** Tools for writing papers, creating presentations, and submitting work\n4. **Research:** Safe access to online information for projects and assignments\n5. **Skill development:** Building digital literacy skills you'll need for college and careers\n\nWhile occasional personal use might be necessary (like checking a personal email for a password reset), remember that school technology is primarily for your education. When you log in to any Excel High School system, your focus should be on activities that support your learning goals.\n\n### Core Concept 2: No Expectation of Privacy\n\nAn important aspect of using Excel High School's technology is understanding privacy limitations. When using school systems, you should have no expectation of privacy. This means:\n\n- School administrators can monitor and review your online activities\n- Your files, messages, and browsing history on school systems may be viewed by staff\n- All activity on school networks can be logged and reviewed\n\nThis policy isn't meant to invade your privacy\u2014it exists to:\n- Ensure everyone's safety online\n- Maintain the educational focus of school resources\n- Protect the school network from security threats\n- Help identify and address any misuse of technology\n\nAlways approach your online activities at school with the understanding that they are not private. A good rule of thumb: if you wouldn't be comfortable with a teacher looking over your shoulder at what you're doing, you probably shouldn't be doing it on school technology.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Prohibited Activities and Technology Safeguards\n\nTo maintain a safe and productive learning environment, certain activities are not allowed when using Excel High School technology.
