This lesson covers the essential productivity software you'll need, important limitations when using mobile devices, and how to configure your browser settings for full access to all course materials. Taking a few minutes now to set up your technology correctly will help you avoid frustrating technical issues later and allow you to focus on what matters most\u2014your education.\n\n## Core Concept 1: Required Productivity Tools\n\nTo complete your coursework at Excel High School, you'll need software for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. You have two excellent options:\n\n### Microsoft Office\nMicrosoft Office includes Word (for documents), Excel (for spreadsheets), and PowerPoint (for presentations). You can access Microsoft Office in several ways:\n\n- **Office 365 Education**: Many students qualify for free access! Visit [education.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office) and enter your school email to check eligibility.\n\n- **Office Online**: Microsoft offers free web-based versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint at [office.com](https://www.office.com). These versions have fewer features than the desktop applications but work well for most high school assignments.\n\n### Google Workspace\nGoogle offers completely free alternatives that work great for high school coursework:\n\n- **Google Docs**: For creating text documents (similar to Word)\n- **Google Sheets**: For creating spreadsheets (similar to Excel)\n- **Google Slides**: For creating presentations (similar to PowerPoint)\n\nTo access these tools, create a free Google account at [google.com](https://www.google.com) if you don't already have one, then visit [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com).\n\n**Which should you choose?** Both options work well for your Excel High School courses. If you're already familiar with one system, it's usually best to stick with what you know. Google's tools are completely free and automatically save your work, while Microsoft Office may offer more advanced features that some students prefer.\n\nWhen submitting assignments, save your files in standard formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, or PDF) to ensure your teachers can open them without problems.\n\n## Core Concept 2: Mobile Device Limitations\n\nWhile you can access Excel High School's learning platform on smartphones and tablets, there are important limitations you should know about:\n\n### What You CAN Do on Mobile Devices\nMobile devices are convenient for:\n- Reading course materials and announcements\n- Watching instructional videos\n- Checking grades and feedback\n- Reviewing assignment instructions\n- Participating in discussions\n\n### What You CANNOT Do on Mobile Devices\nFor these critical activities, you MUST use a laptop or desktop computer:\n- **Taking exams or quizzes**: The testing system requires a computer for security and functionality reasons.\n- **Completing certain interactive activities**: Some course elements don't work properly on touchscreens.\n- **Uploading complex assignments**: While technically possible on some mobile devices, the process is often frustrating and error-prone.\n\n**Best Practice**: Use mobile devices to review content when you're on the go, but plan to complete all assignments and exams on a computer. This ensures you'll have full functionality and won't risk losing work or encountering technical problems during important assessments.\n\n## Core Concept 3: Enabling Pop-ups for External Resources\n\nExcel High School courses include valuable external resources that open in pop-up windows. Most browsers block these pop-ups by default, which can prevent you from accessing important course materials.

  "edit_summary": "The edits made were minimal and focused on improving accessibility for high school students:\n\n1. Removed first-person plural pronouns (\"our learning platform\") and replaced with more neutral language to maintain a consistent, clear voice for asynchronous learners.\n\n2. Simplified a few sentences by removing unnecessary words and making the language more direct (e.g., \"there are important limitations you need to understand\" \u2192 \"there are important limitations you should know about\").\n\n3. Made minor adjustments to maintain a consistent tone throughout the document that speaks directly to the student without being overly formal or using unnecessary self-references.\n\n4. Preserved all the core content, structure, and educational value while making the language slightly more accessible to the 14-18 age range."
