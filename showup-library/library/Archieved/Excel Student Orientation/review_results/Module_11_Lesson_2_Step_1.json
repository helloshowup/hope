Be sure to provide accurate contact information, as this will be used for all future communications.\n\n**Step 2: Sign the Enrollment Agreement**\nAfter submitting your application, you'll receive an enrollment agreement via email. This document outlines the terms of your enrollment, including program details, tuition information, and school policies. Review this document carefully before signing electronically. Your signature shows you understand and accept Excel High School's educational terms.\n\n**Step 3: Submit Required Documents**\nNext, you'll need to upload:\n- Previous school transcripts (if applicable)\n- Government-issued photo ID (like a driver's license or passport)\n- Any additional documentation requested for your specific program\n\nThese documents help us place you in appropriate courses and verify your identity for academic integrity purposes.\n\n**Step 4: Complete Student Consultation**\nThe final step is a brief consultation with an Excel High School advisor.
