# Participation Pledge

# Participation Pledge

Your commitment to active participation forms the backbone of successful online learning. This Participation Pledge represents your personal promise to engage regularly with coursework and manage your time effectively. By acknowledging this pledge, you're taking ownership of your educational journey at Excel High School. Students who actively commit to participation guidelines typically complete their courses successfully and achieve their academic goals. The habits you develop now will serve you well throughout high school and in your future college and career paths.

## Understanding Your Commitment to Active Participation

Active participation means meaningful engagement with your courses and taking responsibility for your learning. Your participation commitment includes:

- **Regular Login Schedule**: Logging into your courses consistently (recommended 3-5 times per week)
- **Time Management**: Dedicating sufficient time to your studies (typically 5-10 hours per week per course)
- **Active Engagement**: Completing all required readings, videos, and interactive elements
- **Communication**: Reaching out to instructors when you need help and responding to feedback
- **Progress Monitoring**: Staying on track with course deadlines and your personal goals

Your specific time commitment may vary based on your programme, learning style, and course difficulty. The key is establishing a consistent routine that works for your situation while ensuring steady progress toward completion.

Participation goes beyond simply ticking boxes—it's about getting the most from your learning experience. When you actively engage with course content, you develop deeper understanding and retain information more effectively, which will benefit you in future courses and beyond high school.

## Digital Acknowledgment Process

To formalise your commitment to active participation, you'll complete a simple digital acknowledgment in your student portal. This process includes:

1. Reviewing the participation expectations outlined in your student dashboard
2. Considering how these expectations fit with your personal schedule
3. Clicking the "I Acknowledge" button to formally commit to these standards
4. Saving a copy of your acknowledgment for your records

This digital acknowledgment will be recorded in your student profile and serves as your personal commitment to:
- Managing your time effectively to meet course requirements
- Participating actively in all aspects of your courses
- Taking responsibility for your academic progress
- Seeking help when needed to maintain consistent engagement

This step matters—it helps establish the mindset and habits that lead to academic success.
