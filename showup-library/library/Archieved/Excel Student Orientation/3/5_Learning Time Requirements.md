# Learning Time Requirements

# Learning Time Requirements

Managing your time well makes a huge difference in online education. Excel High School courses offer flexibility, but this comes with the responsibility to engage consistently with your studies. Let's look at how much time you should dedicate to your coursework each day to build sustainable habits and achieve academic success.

## Recommended Daily Study Time

![Daily Study Time Recommendations](https://example.com/study-time-graphic.jpg)
*This graphic shows the recommended daily study minutes per course type at Excel High School. Standard courses require 50-60 minutes daily, while honours and AP courses require 60-75 minutes daily.*

### Standard Courses
For each standard course in your schedule, you should dedicate **50-60 minutes per day** of focused study time. This includes:
- Reading assigned materials
- Watching instructional videos
- Completing exercises
- Taking notes
- Working on assignments

This recommendation stems from educational research showing that consistent, moderate study sessions work much better than cramming the night before. By spending about an hour daily on each course, you'll make steady progress while giving your brain time to properly process and retain what you're learning.

### Honours and AP Courses
For Honours and Advanced Placement (AP) courses, the recommended daily study time increases to **60-75 minutes per day** per course. These advanced courses contain more challenging content and typically require:
- More in-depth reading
- Additional problem-solving
- More complex assignments
- Greater preparation for assessments

The extra 10-15 minutes per day accounts for the increased complexity and volume of material, helping you maintain a good pace while thoroughly understanding challenging concepts.

## Why Daily Engagement Matters

Consistent daily engagement with your coursework serves several important purposes:

1. **Legal Compliance**: State education laws require documentation of adequate instructional time for accredited diplomas. Your daily activity helps Excel High School demonstrate compliance with these regulations.

2. **Better Learning**: Cognitive science shows that regular, spaced learning leads to better retention than cramming. Daily study helps move information from short-term to long-term memory.

3. **Progress Tracking**: The recommended daily minutes help you maintain a pace that allows you to complete courses within expected timeframes, preventing last-minute rushes.

4. **Habit Formation**: Setting aside specific time each day builds academic discipline that will benefit you beyond high school, whether at university or in your career.

## Creating Your Study Schedule

To put these time recommendations into action:

1. **Calculate your total daily commitment**: Multiply the number of courses by the recommended minutes per course
   - Example: 5 standard courses × 50 minutes = 250 minutes (about 4 hours and 10 minutes)

2. **Distribute study blocks strategically**: Rather than studying for all courses in one marathon session, break your study time into manageable chunks throughout the day
   - Morning study works well for complex subjects when your mind is fresh
   - Afternoon sessions are good for practice and application activities
   - Evening review helps consolidate what you've learned before sleep

3. **Include short breaks**: Taking a 5-10 minute break after every 25-30 minutes of focused study improves retention and prevents burnout

4. **Identify Your Best Learning Times**: Think about when you're most alert - morning, afternoon, or evening. Schedule your toughest courses during these peak performance times.

5. **Create a Visual Schedule**: Use a planner, calendar app, or simple chart to map out your daily study blocks for each course.

Remember that these time recommendations represent focused, active learning time. This means putting away your phone, closing social media tabs, and turning off the telly during your dedicated study blocks.

## Over to You:

1. Based on your current course load, how many total minutes should you be studying each day?

2. What specific challenges might you face in meeting these daily time requirements, and how will you address them?

3. How might you track your actual study time to make sure you're meeting the recommended guidelines and to identify areas where you might need to adjust your approach?
