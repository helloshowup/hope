# Learning Time Requirements

# Learning Time Requirements

Staying active in your online courses isn't just a good idea—it's a requirement at Excel High School. We've established specific activity guidelines to help you stay on track with your studies. Let's look at what happens if you go too long without logging in, and how the school will try to reconnect with you if that happens. Understanding these policies will help you manage your time better and develop the self-discipline that online learning demands.

## Core Concept 1: The 30-Day Inactivity Policy

Excel High School keeps an eye on student activity to make sure everyone is progressing appropriately. When you haven't logged into your account for 30 consecutive days, the system flags your account, which triggers our first check-in with you.

**What happens at the 30-day mark:**

1. **Automated notification**: You'll receive an email alerting you to your inactivity status
2. **Academic advisor contact**: Your assigned advisor will reach out via email and/or phone
3. **Status warning**: Your student account will be flagged with an "inactivity warning"

This 30-day checkpoint is really just an early wake-up call. Many students simply need a reminder to jump back into their coursework after life gets busy. At this stage, we just want to reconnect you with your studies before things get more complicated.

Remember that meaningful academic activity resets this counter. This includes:
- Submitting assignments
- Participating in discussions
- Engaging with course materials

Just logging in briefly without doing any actual work probably won't count as meaningful activity.

## Core Concept 2: The 60-Day Inactivity Consequences

If you continue to be inactive for 60 consecutive days, the situation becomes more serious:

1. **Formal academic probation**: Your account status changes to "Academic Probation"
2. **Possible course withdrawal**: You may be withdrawn from your current courses
3. **Transcript implications**: Withdrawal grades may appear on your transcript
4. **Required intervention**: You'll need to meet with your academic advisor to create a re-engagement plan
5. **Potential reinstatement process**: Additional paperwork and possible fees may be required

For students receiving financial aid or enrolled through partner programmes, extended inactivity may put your funding at risk. Additionally, if you're trying to graduate by a certain date, long periods of inactivity will make it much harder to complete your studies on time.

The 60-day mark is a critical point. At this stage, Excel High School needs to determine whether you plan to continue with your studies or if we need to make alternative arrangements.

## Core Concept 3: Communication Protocols During Inactivity Periods

When student accounts show signs of inactivity, we follow a structured communication plan:

**The communication sequence includes:**

1. **Day 25 of inactivity**: Friendly reminder via email that you're approaching the 30-day threshold
2. **Day 30 of inactivity**: Formal notification via email and text message (if you've opted in)
3. **Days 31-45**: Your academic advisor will make at least two documented attempts to contact you through different channels
4. **Day 50**: Final warning communication sent via email with "Action Required" in the subject line
5. **Day 60**: Formal notice of academic probation status and account restrictions

All official communications will come from verified Excel High School email addresses (ending in @excelhighschool.org) and will include your student ID for verification. If you're under 18, your parents/guardians will also be notified about your inactivity.

Keep your contact information updated in your student profile—otherwise, you might miss these important messages. Planning to be away for a while due to travel, health issues, or other circumstances? A quick heads-up to your academic advisor beforehand can prevent unnecessary worry and keep your account in good standing.

2. If you received a 30-day inactivity notice, what steps would you take to re-engage with your coursework and communicate with the school?
