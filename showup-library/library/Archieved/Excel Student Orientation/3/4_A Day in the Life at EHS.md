# A Day in the Life at EHS

# A Day in the Life at EHS

At Excel High School, your learning journey looks quite different from traditional school. There are no bells ringing or scheduled class periods—instead, you have the freedom to create a study schedule that fits your life. This flexibility is brilliant, but it does require good habits and self-discipline. Let's look at how successful EHS students organise their day and discover strategies to keep you motivated throughout your studies.

## A Day in the Life of a Successful EHS Learner

Meet Maya, a dedicated Excel High School student who has developed effective habits for online learning success. Here's what a typical weekday looks like for her:

**Morning Routine: Setting Up for Success**

Maya starts her day at 7:30 AM with a healthy breakfast and reviews her study plan. She has a dedicated "school zone" in her home—a small desk with good lighting, her laptop, notebooks, and all necessary supplies.

"When I sit at my desk, my brain knows it's time to focus," Maya explains.

By 8:30 AM, Maya logs into her EHS dashboard. She first checks for any new announcements or feedback from teachers on previously submitted work. She spends about 15 minutes responding to messages before diving into coursework.

**9:00 AM - 10:30 AM:** Maya tackles her most challenging subject first when her mind is freshest. Today, it's Algebra II. She reads the lesson material, watches the instructional videos, takes careful notes, and completes the practice problems.

"What works best for me is breaking larger assignments into smaller, manageable chunks," Maya shares. "For essays or projects, I create a mini-schedule with deadlines for each component."

**10:30 AM - 10:45 AM:** Short break time! Maya steps away from her computer, stretches, drinks water, and gives her eyes a rest from screen time.

**Midday: Active Learning Strategies**

**10:45 AM - 12:15 PM:** She moves on to her English course, reading the assigned literature and working on her analytical essay. She refers to the rubric (the grading guide that shows what's expected) frequently to make sure she's meeting all requirements.

During her study blocks, Maya doesn't just passively read through course materials. She actively engages with the content by:
- Taking detailed notes in her own words
- Creating flashcards for key concepts
- Using the 25/5 Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break)
- Reaching out to teachers when she has questions rather than remaining stuck

**12:15 PM - 1:00 PM:** Lunch break. Maya eats away from her study area and takes time to mentally recharge, often including some physical activity to refresh her mind.

**Afternoon: Collaboration and Review**

**1:00 PM - 2:30 PM:** Maya works on her Science course, carefully reading through the material and completing the interactive activities. She makes connections between the new information and what she already knows.

Though online learning can sometimes feel solitary, Maya makes a point to connect with other EHS students through discussion boards and virtual study groups when possible.

"I used to think asking questions meant I wasn't smart enough," Maya admits. "Now I realise that reaching out to teachers when I'm confused is one of the smartest things I can do."

**2:30 PM - 2:45 PM:** Another short break to refresh her mind.

**2:45 PM - 4:00 PM:** Maya reviews what she's learnt today and prepares for tomorrow by previewing upcoming lessons. She updates her calendar with specific goals for the next day.

**Evening: Reflection and Preparation**

Before ending her school day, Maya takes 15 minutes to reflect on her progress. She checks off completed tasks in her planner, notes any questions that arose during her studies, and sends any questions to her teachers.

Maya also builds in time for exercise, family, and hobbies. This balance prevents burnout (feeling overwhelmed and exhausted) and actually improves her academic performance.

"I always prepare for the next day before I finish. This eliminates morning confusion and helps me start fresh."

## Keys to Maya's Success

What makes Maya successful as an EHS student?

1. **Consistent Schedule:** Maya treats school as her job, maintaining regular hours and dedicated study blocks.

2. **Dedicated Workspace:** She studies in a quiet space free from interruptions and uses website blockers during study time to avoid social media temptations.

3. **Active Engagement:** Instead of passively reading, Maya actively engages with the material by taking notes, creating flashcards, and explaining concepts in her own words.

4. **Proactive Communication:** She maintains ongoing communication with her teachers, never hesitating to ask questions when she's confused.

5. **Progress Tracking:** Maya regularly checks her gradebook and course progress indicators to stay aware of her advancement through each course.

6. **Self-Care:** She incorporates regular breaks, physical activity, and adequate sleep into her routine to maintain mental sharpness.

7. **Goal Setting:** Maya sets both daily goals (complete two lessons) and long-term goals (finish the course by a specific date) to stay on track.

## Over to You: Reflection Activity

Now it's your turn to think about your own EHS journey:

**List two specific strategies you'll use to stay motivated in your online courses at EHS.**

Consider questions like:
- What daily routines will help you maintain focus and productivity?
- How will you reward yourself for meeting goals?
- What accountability systems might work for you?
- How will you connect with the EHS community for support?
- What strategies will help you overcome procrastination?

Remember, successful online learning is not about perfection—it's about consistency, self-awareness, and developing habits that work for your unique situation. By establishing a routine that works for you and implementing strategies to maintain motivation, you'll be well on your way to success at Excel High School!
