When technical issues pop up during your online coursework at Excel High School, knowing where to find help quickly can save you loads of frustration. This guide will walk you through the available tech support resources and show you how to get your problems sorted efficiently so you can get back to your studies.

## Where to Find Help

### Help Desk Support System
The main resource for technical assistance at Excel High School is our Help Desk support system. This is where you'll submit support tickets for any technical issues you encounter during your studies.

You should have already seen the video tutorial about using the Help Desk system in your orientation. If you missed it or need a refresher, take a few minutes to review the **[Help Desk Tutorial Video](https://support.excelhighschool.com/helpdesk-tutorial)**.

The video covers:

- How to track your ticket's status

### Support Hours
Our technical support team is available during these hours:
- Monday through Friday: 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM (Central Time)
- Weekend support: Limited to emergency issues only

You can submit a ticket anytime, but responses will only come during these operational hours. Keep this in mind if you're working on assignments with approaching deadlines.

### Quick Access Tip
Here's a time-saving trick that many successful students use:

1. Navigate to the Help Desk portal at https://support.excelhighschool.com
2. Click the star icon (or bookmark icon) in your browser's address bar
3. Name the bookmark "EHS Help Desk" for easy identification
4. Consider placing it in your bookmarks toolbar for one-click access

This simple step means you won't waste time hunting for the correct URL when you're already dealing with a technical problem.

## Best Practices for Getting Technical Support

Before reaching out to the Help Desk, try these quick troubleshooting steps:
- Refresh your browser page

These simple fixes often solve common issues and can save you the wait time for a response.
