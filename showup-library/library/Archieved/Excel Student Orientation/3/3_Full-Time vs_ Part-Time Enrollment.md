## Your Results

**Mostly A's: Full-Time Enrolment Recommended**
You seem to have the time and circumstances that work well with full-time study. With 25+ hours available weekly and fewer competing responsibilities, you can make steady progress through your courses. Full-time students typically complete 5-6 credits per semester, helping you graduate sooner. This option may also qualify you for certain financial aid programmes that require full-time status.

**Mostly B's: Full-Time Enrolment Possible, But Consider Your Limits**
You could manage as a full-time student, but you'll need solid time management skills. Your other commitments are significant but workable. Consider starting full-time but be ready to adjust if things get overwhelming. Excel High School offers flexibility if you need to change your status later.

**Mostly C's: Part-Time Enrolment Recommended**
Your current life suggests that part-time study would be more sustainable. With significant work or family commitments, the reduced course load (typically 2-4 credits per semester) will help you balance education with other responsibilities. This approach may take longer to complete your diploma, but it sets you up for success by matching your academic load to your available time.

**Mostly D's: Part-Time Enrolment with Reduced Course Load Recommended**
Your changing schedule and commitments point to a highly flexible, reduced course load as your best option. Starting with just 1-2 courses will help you establish good study habits while managing your varying responsibilities. Excel High School gives you up to 12 months per course, providing the flexibility you need. You can always take more courses later as you settle into a routine.

**Mixed Results:**
If your answers were all over the place, consider starting part-time to establish your academic routine. You can always increase to full-time later if you find you have more capacity than you thought. Success often comes from setting realistic expectations rather than taking on too much at the start.

## Key Points to Consider

**For Full-Time Students:**
- Plan to spend 25+ hours weekly on coursework
- Complete approximately 5-6 credits per semester
- May qualify for more financial aid options
- Can potentially graduate more quickly (12-18 months)
- Requires good time management skills

**For Part-Time Students:**
- More flexibility to balance school with work/family
- Can take fewer courses at once (minimum of 1 course)
- Typically complete 2-4 credits per semester
- Longer overall time to graduation
- Often better for students with significant outside commitments

Remember that at Excel High School, you can adjust your enrolment status if your life changes. The right choice is the one that works for your unique situation.
