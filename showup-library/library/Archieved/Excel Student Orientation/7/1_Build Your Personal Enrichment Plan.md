## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify opportunities for personal growth through clubs and service projects

It's time to chart your path to success at Excel High School! You've spent your orientation learning about academic standards, support systems, and growth opportunities. Now comes the exciting part - creating your own Personal Enrichment Plan. This interactive exercise will help you set concrete goals, choose meaningful activities, and build a foundation for a rewarding high school experience. By the end, you'll have a practical roadmap for your academic and personal development that you can refine with your Success Coach.

### Core Concept 1: Setting Your GPA Target

Your academic performance plays a key role in your high school journey. At Excel High School, we use the Laude system to recognise academic achievement. This system encourages you to challenge yourself and aim high.

To begin your Personal Enrichment Plan, you'll choose a GPA target that aligns with one of the Laude tiers:

- Summa Cum Laude: 3.9 - 4.0 GPA
- Magna Cum Laude: 3.7 - 3.89 GPA
- Cum Laude: 3.5 - 3.69 GPA

What target feels right for you? Consider your strengths, interests, and long-term goals when selecting. This is your personal goal - choose something that challenges you while remaining achievable. Your Success Coach can help you adjust this goal as you progress.

### Core Concept 2: Selecting Extracurricular Activities

Clubs and service projects add depth to your high school experience, help you develop new skills, and create meaningful connections. As part of your Personal Enrichment Plan, you'll select at least one club and one service project to participate in.

Excel High School offers a variety of clubs for different interests, such as:

- Debate Club
- Environmental Awareness Group
- Creative Writing Society
- Coding Club
- Student Government

For service projects, consider options like:

- Virtual tutoring for younger students
- Online fundraising for charitable causes
- Community Clean-Up Initiative
- Senior Centre Companionship Programme
- Animal Shelter Support

Which activities spark your interest? Choose ones that align with your passions and career goals. These experiences will boost your personal growth and strengthen your college applications and future CVs. Remember, deep involvement in fewer activities often makes more impact than spreading yourself too thin.

### Core Concept 3: SMART Goal Setting

To make your Personal Enrichment Plan work effectively, we'll use the SMART goal approach. SMART stands for:

- **S**pecific: Clearly define what you want to accomplish
- **M**easurable: Include concrete criteria to track progress
- **A**chievable: Set realistic goals that you can attain
- **R**elevant: Make sure your goals align with your overall objectives
- **T**ime-bound: Set a specific timeframe for achieving your goals

For example, instead of a vague goal like "improve my grades," a SMART goal would be: "Raise my GPA from 3.5 to 3.7 by the end of the first semester by attending weekly study groups and completing all assignments on time."

### Over to You:

1. Considering your chosen GPA target, what specific strategies will you implement to achieve and maintain this academic goal?

2. How do you think your selected club and service project will contribute to your personal growth and future aspirations?

3. Think about a long-term goal you have for after high school. How can you use the SMART framework to break this down into smaller, actionable steps during your time at Excel High School?
