# How the Laude Latin Model Works

## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** 1, Lesson 3

**Lesson Title:** Understanding the Laude Latin Honours System

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the three tiers of the Laude Latin honours system
- Compare unweighted and weighted GPA requirements for each honour level
- Describe how Latin honours appear on academic transcripts and diplomas

The Laude Latin honours system is a prestigious way to recognise outstanding academic achievement during your high school journey. Knowing how this system works can help you set meaningful goals and provide motivation as you progress through your studies at Excel High School. Let's explore what these honours mean, how they're calculated, and why they matter for your future.

### Core Concept 1: The Three Tiers of Laude Latin Honours

The Laude Latin honours system includes three distinct levels of recognition:

1. **Cum Laude:** Meaning "with honour" in Latin, this first tier acknowledges students who have maintained strong academic performance throughout high school.

2. **Magna Cum Laude:** Translating to "with great honour," this second tier represents a higher level of academic excellence. Students earning this distinction have consistently performed exceptionally well across their coursework.

3. **Summa Cum Laude:** The highest tier, meaning "with highest honour," is reserved for students who have demonstrated truly outstanding academic achievement. This honour recognises those who have performed at the very top of their class.

These honours are awarded based on your cumulative grade point average (GPA) throughout your high school career. While specific requirements may vary between schools, they always represent progressively higher standards of academic performance.

### Core Concept 2: Unweighted vs. Weighted GPA Cut-offs

Schools may use either unweighted or weighted GPAs when determining Latin honours:

**Unweighted GPA:**
- Based on a 4.0 scale
- Treats all classes equally, regardless of difficulty
- Typical cut-offs might be:
  - Cum Laude: 3.5 - 3.69
  - Magna Cum Laude: 3.7 - 3.89
  - Summa Cum Laude: 3.9 - 4.0

**Weighted GPA:**
- Often based on a 5.0 scale
- Assigns extra points for honours, AP, or IB courses (Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate)
- Typical cut-offs might be:
  - Cum Laude: 4.0 - 4.24
  - Magna Cum Laude: 4.25 - 4.49
  - Summa Cum Laude: 4.5 and above

The weighted GPA system acknowledges the additional challenge of advanced courses. For instance, an A in an AP class might be worth 5.0 points instead of 4.0. This approach encourages you to challenge yourself with more difficult coursework while still having a shot at top honours.

At Excel High School, we want you to understand how your course choices and grades contribute to your potential for earning Latin honours. Do check the specific GPA requirements that apply to your programme.

### Core Concept 3: Appearance on Transcripts and Diplomas

Latin honours are a valuable addition to your academic credentials:

**On Transcripts:**
- Latin honours typically appear at the end of your transcript
- They may be listed as a simple designation (e.g., "Summa Cum Laude") or with additional details
- Some transcripts include the specific GPA that earned the honour

**On Diplomas:**
- Latin honours are often printed directly on the diploma
- They usually appear below your name and the degree conferred
- The specific honour is clearly stated, adding prestige to your credential

**During Graduation:**
- Honourees may wear special coloured cords or stoles
- Your honour may be announced as you receive your diploma
- The graduation programme might include special notation next to your name

These honours serve as a permanent record of your academic excellence. They can make a real difference when applying for university, scholarships, or even early career opportunities, as they quickly communicate your high level of achievement to reviewers.

### Over to You:

1. Consider your current GPA. Which level of Latin honours might you be on track to achieve? What steps could you take to reach the next level?

2. How might the difference between weighted and unweighted GPAs affect your course selection strategy? Would you be more likely to take challenging courses knowing they might be weighted more heavily?

3. Beyond university applications, how do you think earning Latin honours might benefit you in your future academic or professional pursuits?

### Check Your Understanding

1. Which of the following is the correct order of Latin honours, from lowest to highest distinction?
   A. Magna Cum Laude, Cum Laude, Summa Cum Laude
   B. Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, Summa Cum Laude
   C. Summa Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, Cum Laude
   D. Cum Laude, Summa Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude

2. In a weighted GPA system, why might an A in an AP class be worth more points?
   A. To discourage students from taking regular courses
   B. To recognise the additional rigour of advanced coursework
   C. Because AP teachers grade more strictly
   D. To make transcripts more complicated

3. Where are Latin honours typically displayed? (Select all that apply)
   A. On transcripts
   B. On diplomas
   C. During graduation ceremonies
   D. All of the above

### Summary

The Laude Latin honours system provides a meaningful way to recognise exceptional academic achievement during your high school career. With its three tiers - Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, and Summa Cum Laude - it offers clear benchmarks for excellence that you can aim for. Understanding the differences between weighted and unweighted GPA calculations helps you make smart decisions about course selections and academic planning. These honours, featured prominently on your transcripts and diplomas, serve as lasting proof of your hard work and academic abilities. As you continue your studies at Excel High School, keep these honours in mind as potential goals to help you consistently perform at your best.
