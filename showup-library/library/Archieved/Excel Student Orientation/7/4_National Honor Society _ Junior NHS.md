The National Honour Society (NHS) and Junior National Honour Society (JNHS) stand out as prestigious organisations that celebrate exceptional high school students. For Excel High School students, joining these societies isn't just another achievement for your university applications—it's a genuine opportunity to build leadership skills, make a difference in your community, and connect with peers who share your commitment to academic excellence.

Let's dive into what it takes to join NHS or JNHS, explore the values these organisations champion, and walk through how to apply. Whether you're a Year 7 student thinking about Junior NHS or a high school sophomore considering NHS, this information will help you prepare for a strong application.

### Core Concept 1: Eligibility Criteria

To be considered for NHS or JNHS, you'll need to meet these basic requirements:

**Academic Requirements:**
- Minimum GPA of 3.5 (unweighted)
- This shows your dedication to academic excellence across all subjects

**Grade Level Requirements:**
- Junior NHS: Open to students in years 7-9
- NHS: Open to students in years 10-12

Meeting these criteria makes you eligible to apply, but doesn't guarantee you'll be accepted. The selection process looks at all four pillars of NHS, not just your grades. Think of the GPA requirement as your foot in the door—the rest of your application will need to demonstrate who you are beyond your academic achievements.

**Pro Tip:** If your GPA is currently below 3.5, don't worry! Start working now to improve your marks. Even if this year isn't your year to apply, building strong academic habits will set you up for success later on.

### Core Concept 2: The Four Pillars of NHS

NHS and JNHS evaluate candidates based on four fundamental pillars. Understanding these will help you craft a compelling application:

**1. Scholarship**
This pillar shows up in your GPA, but it's about more than good marks. It's about showing genuine intellectual curiosity.

*Examples of scholarship activities:*
- Taking part in academic competitions or olympiads
- Helping classmates understand difficult subjects
- Challenging yourself with advanced courses
- Working on independent research projects

**2. Leadership**
NHS members should positively influence others and take initiative in school and community settings.

*Examples of leadership activities:*
- Serving as an officer in a school club
- Captaining a sports team
- Organising school events or fundraisers
- Taking the lead on group projects
- Starting something new at your school

**3. Character**
This pillar looks at your integrity, ethics, and how you treat others.

*Examples of good character:*
- Being honest in your schoolwork
- Showing respect to teachers and peers
- Taking responsibility when things go wrong
- Supporting classmates through challenges
- Being someone others can count on

**4. Service**
NHS and JNHS members actively help others and improve their communities.

*Examples of service activities:*
- Volunteering with local organisations
- Participating in community clean-ups
- Helping run school events
- Supporting charitable causes
- Creating care packages for people in need

When you apply, you'll need to share specific examples of how you've demonstrated each pillar. Start thinking about your experiences now and how they align with these values.

### Core Concept 3: Application Process

The application process for NHS and JNHS at Excel High School follows these steps:

**1. Expression of Interest**
Eligible students receive an invitation to apply. You'll need to confirm you'd like to be considered.

**2. Application Submission**
You'll complete a form that includes:
- Your academic information
- Extracurricular activities
- Leadership positions
- Service hours and activities
- Personal statement or essay
- Character references

**3. Faculty Review**
A committee of teachers and administrators reviews all applications, considering how well you demonstrate the four pillars.

**4. Service Verification**
You'll need to document your community service hours. Keep good records of your volunteer work, including dates, hours, and supervisor contact details.

**5. Final Selection**
The faculty council makes final decisions based on your complete application.

**6. Induction Ceremony**
Successful candidates are formally welcomed into the NHS or JNHS during a special ceremony that celebrates your achievement.

**Worth Noting:** Excel High School students in the ElevatED Summit programme receive extra guidance for their NHS applications, including application workshops, essay feedback, and mentoring from current NHS members.

### Over to You:
