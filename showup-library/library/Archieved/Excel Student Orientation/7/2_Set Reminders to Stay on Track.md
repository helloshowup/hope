## LESSON INFORMATION SECTION

**Module Number:** Module 1, Lesson 5

**Lesson Number:** 5

**Lesson Title:** Setting Reminders to Stay on Track

## LEARNING COMPONENTS

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Create a calendar reminder to revisit their academic plan at the semester midpoint
- Formulate reflective questions to assess their progress and motivation
- Develop a strategy for maintaining focus on academic goals throughout the semester

Many of us start each semester with good intentions that somehow fade as the weeks go by. You've already created an academic plan at Excel High School, but the real trick is staying connected to that plan when life gets busy.

In this lesson, we'll look at practical ways to use strategic reminders that keep your goals in focus. Setting up a mid-semester review and asking yourself the right questions aren't just helpful for your current studies—these habits will serve you well in university and your future career. A few well-placed reminders might be just what you need to stay on course!

### Core Concept 1: Setting a Calendar Reminder

A mid-semester calendar reminder is a straightforward but effective tool to help you stay connected with your academic goals. It's like booking an appointment with yourself that you don't want to miss.

**Here's how to set up a reminder that works:**

1. **Find your midpoint date:** Check your semester calendar and mark the halfway point (typically around week 8 in a 16-week semester).

2. **Choose your calendar tool:** Use whatever digital calendar you actually look at regularly - Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or the calendar app on your phone.

3. **Create a meaningful event:** Name it something that will catch your attention like "My Mid-Semester Review" and block off 30-45 minutes when you can focus without interruptions.

4. **Include key details:** In the description, jot down:
   - "Review my academic progress"
   - "Check if I'm on track with my GPA goals"
   - "Evaluate my study habits and time management"

5. **Set alerts that you'll notice:** Add notifications that will actually grab your attention - perhaps one a week before, one the day before, and one on the day itself.

6. **Pick a good time:** Schedule it when you're typically alert and motivated, not when you're usually tired or busy with other commitments.

The trick isn't just creating the reminder—it's actually following through when it pops up. Treat this review with the same importance as you would a doctor's appointment or job interview.

### Core Concept 2: Crafting Reflective Questions

When your mid-semester reminder appears, you'll want to have thoughtful questions ready that help you honestly assess your progress and reconnect with your motivation.

**Consider these reflection questions by category:**

**Academic Performance:**
- Am I on track to meet my target GPA this semester?
- Which subjects am I doing well in, and which ones need more attention?
- Have I turned in all assignments on time, or am I falling behind in any courses?

**Study Habits:**
- Is my current study schedule working for me?
- When and where do I feel most productive when studying?
- Am I actively engaging with my courses or just going through the motions?

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- What's been my biggest hurdle so far this semester?
- How have I handled difficulties that have come up?
- What resources at Excel High School haven't I tried yet that might help me?

**Motivation and Goals:**
- Do I still feel connected to the goals I set at the beginning of the semester?
- What's one achievement I'm proud of so far?
- If my motivation has dipped, what might help me reconnect with my purpose?

**Balance and Wellbeing:**
- Am I balancing school, other responsibilities, and self-care?
- How are my stress levels, and what adjustments might help?
- Am I getting enough sleep to support my learning?

You don't need to tackle every question during your review. Pick 5-7 that seem most relevant to your situation. The point is to gain honest insights that lead to practical adjustments for the second half of your semester.

### Core Concept 3: Maintaining Focus Throughout the Semester

While your mid-semester review matters, staying focused on your academic goals requires ongoing attention. Here are approaches that other high school students have found helpful for maintaining momentum:

**1. Weekly Mini-Reviews (5-10 minutes)**
Set aside a consistent time each week (Sunday evenings work well for many students) to quickly go through your upcoming assignments, look at your grades, and set priorities for the week ahead.

**2. Visual Reminders**
Put a simple visual reminder of your goals in your study space. This could be:
- A small whiteboard with your target GPA
- A colourful sticky note with your "why" statement (your personal reason for pursuing education)
- A progress tracker for each course

**3. Accountability Connections**
Share your goals with someone who can help keep you on track:
- A parent or family member
- A friend who's also serious about doing well in school
- Your Excel High School Success Coach

**4. Celebration System**
Plan small rewards for hitting milestones:
- Finishing a challenging assignment
- Sticking to your study schedule for two weeks straight
- Improving your grade in a difficult subject

**5. Digital Helpers**
Use technology to your advantage:
- Set recurring reminders for regular study times
- Try apps like Forest or Focus Keeper to manage study sessions
- Add calendar alerts for important due dates

The key is finding what suits your personal style and situation. You might need to try different approaches before discovering the combination that helps you stay consistently focused on your Excel High School goals.

### Summary

Setting reminders to stay on track is a practical strategy that can make a real difference in your success at Excel High School. By creating a mid-semester review reminder, preparing thoughtful reflection questions, and implementing ongoing focus strategies, you're taking control of your educational journey.

Remember that the most successful students aren't necessarily those who never face challenges - they're the ones who regularly take stock of their progress and make adjustments when needed. Your mid-semester review is your chance to celebrate what's working, identify what isn't, and make smart changes for the second half of the semester.

As you continue with your Excel High School courses, these reminder and reflection techniques will help you stay connected to your goals and maintain momentum throughout each semester. These skills won't just help you now—they'll be valuable throughout university and your future career.
