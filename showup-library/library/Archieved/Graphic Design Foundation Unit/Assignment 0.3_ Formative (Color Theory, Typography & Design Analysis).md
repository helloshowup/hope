# **Assignment 0.3: Formative (Colour Theory, Typography & Design Analysis)**

In this assignment, you'll analyse how professional designers use colour and typography to create effective visual communication. You'll select design examples that showcase strong use of these elements, analyse their composition, and apply what you learn to develop your own colour schemes and typographic layouts.

## **Task 1: Quiz**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO1**: *Understand and describe key principles, processes, and terminology of graphic design including elements and principles of design, colour theory, and typography.*

This quiz is designed to check your knowledge of colour theory and typography principles covered in Lesson 3, and to help you identify areas where you need further support.

## **Task 2: Professional Design Analysis and Documentation**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO1**: Understand and describe key principles, processes, and terminology of graphic design including elements and principles of design, colour theory, and typography.  
* **LO2**: Explore and develop creative responses using simple research, ideation and analysis methods relevant to design projects.  
* **LO7** — *Use basic maths or geometric concepts to support creative tasks and problem-solving in design compositions and layouts.*  
* **LO8**: Use appropriate English language skills to read, interpret, and respond to design briefs and explain how designs can be adapted for diverse cultural contexts.

2.1 Choose Your Design Category. Pick ONE  of the below design areas/specialisms to focus on:

* Brand Identity (logos, colour schemes, typography systems)  
* Editorial Design (magazines, books, newsletters)  
* Packaging Design (product packaging, labels)  
* Digital Design (websites, mobile apps, social media graphics)

2.2 Find and Document Your Design Examples. Find 6-8 professional design examples from your chosen category (you'll select 3 of these later for detailed analysis). For each example:

* Save it in your digital folder with the designer's name and year  
* Record the designer's name and background  
* Note where you found it using the Harvard Referencing method   
* Identify one layout feature that reflects a geometric principle (e.g., symmetry, grid alignment, golden ratio, consistent margins, modular structure). Briefly explain how it supports the overall composition (1–2 sentences).  
* Explain why you chose this example and what makes it effective (100-150 words)

## **Task 3: Visual Analysis**

**Learning Outcomes Link to Task 3:**

* LO5 \- Recognise and explain the elements and principles of design, basic colour theory, and typography.  
* LO1 \- Identify and describe critical thinking and research methods relevant to design.  
* LO6 \- Identify cultural factors influencing design decisions and explain how to adapt designs for diverse contexts.

3.1 Technical and Compositional Analysis:

Choose 3 of your collected design examples from task 2.2 for detailed study. For each example, look at and outline:

3.1.1 Colour Analysis:

* What colour scheme is being used? (for example monochromatic, analogous, complementary, etc.)  
* How does the colour palette affect the mood and message of the design? (For example: Think about colour association)  
* Mark the primary, secondary, and additional accent/tertiary colours on the chosen design examples   
* Explain how the colours create harmony or contrast in the composition

3.1.2 Typography Analysis:

* What font types are used (serif, sans-serif, display, script, etc.)?  
* How is typographic hierarchy established? And what is the typographic visual hierarchy?  
* How do the spacing, size, and weight affect readability?  
* What relationship exists between the typographic and other design elements? For example Images, shapes, lines, colours etc 

3.1.3 Cultural Context:

* How might cultural factors influence how these designs are perceived?  
* Would the colour or typography choices work differently in other cultural contexts?  
* What design adjustments might be needed for it to potentially appeal to a more global audience?

## **Task 4: Applied Design Practice**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO1**: Understand and describe key principles, processes, and terminology of graphic design including elements and principles of design, colour theory, and typography.  
* **LO3** – Apply core technical methods to develop and present creative work, including basic navigation of online learning platforms and industry-standard design software.  
* LO4: Communicate ideas effectively through basic visual, written and verbal formats appropriate to design contexts.  
* **LO5**: Reflect on own progress and identify areas for improvement and next steps using rubrics for self-evaluation.

4.1 Visual Presentation Development:

Create a digital presentation (PowerPoint, InDesign, or PDF format) that analyses your 3 selected design examples. For each example, include:

* The original design image with designer attribution  
* Colour scheme extraction showing the main colours used  
* Typography identification with notes on font styles  
* Layout analysis showing how elements are arranged and why  
* Brief explanation of why the design works effectively (or not)

4.2 Colour and Typography Application:

Based on your analysis of the professional examples, create:

* Two different colour palettes (3-5 colours each) that could work for a similar design purpose  
* A simple typographic layout demonstrating hierarchy and readability (with examples)  
* Brief notes explaining your creative decisions and how they were influenced by the examples you studied

4.3 Learning Reflection:

Write a reflection (250-300 words) addressing these questions:

* What did you learn about colour theory and typography by studying professionals' work?  
* Which colour harmonies and typographic principles do you find most effective and why?  
* How do you plan to use these ideas in your own designs?  
* What aspects of colour theory or typography would you like to explore further?

**Remember:** Focus on thoughtful analysis rather than perfect designs. Show that you understand colour theory and typography through how you observe, analyse, and apply these principles. All design attributions must follow the format: Designer/Studio Name, "Title" (if known), Year, Client, Source/Publication (using the Harvard Citing and Referencing method).
