# **Assignment 0.2: Formative (Design Process & Visual Exploration)**

In this hands-on assessment, you'll explore and document the design process from start to finish. You'll use creative thinking techniques, record your design decisions, and build a concept board showcasing your grasp of design elements and principles. This work will help you see how designers develop ideas and turn them into finished projects.

## **Task 1: Quiz**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO2:** Explore and develop creative responses using simple research, ideation and analysis methods relevant to design projects.  
* **LO6:** Demonstrate effective time management, self-directed learning, and independent working practices when following the steps of a design project from concept to delivery.

Before starting your next task, complete the mandatory multiple-choice quiz for Lesson 2 to assess your understanding of the design process and identify areas for improvement.

## **Task 2: Design Process Documentation**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO2**: Explore and develop creative responses using simple research, ideation and analysis methods relevant to design projects.  
* **LO6**: *Demonstrate effective time management, self-directed learning, and independent working practices when following the steps of a design project from concept to delivery.*  
* **LO5**: Reflect on own progress and identify areas for improvement and next steps using rubrics for self-evaluation.

2.1 Select a simple design challenge from the following options:

* Redesign a book cover for your favourite book  
* Create a logo for a fictional cafe  
* Design a poster for a local community event  
* Design packaging for an eco-friendly product

2.2 Document your design process through the following stages:

* Define the brief (identify your audience, purpose, and constraints)  
* Research (collect at least 2 relevant examples and analyze them)  
* Develop ideas (use at least one creative thinking technique from Lesson 2\)  
* Refine ideas (select your strongest concept and develop it further)

2.3 For each stage of your process, document:

* What steps you took  
* Why you made specific decisions  
* What design elements and principles (from Lesson 1\) influenced your choices  
* Challenges you encountered and how you solved them

## **Task 3: Concept Board Development**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO1**: *Understand and describe key principles, processes, and terminology of graphic design including elements and principles of design, colour theory, and typography.v*  
* LO4: Communicate ideas effectively through basic visual, written and verbal formats appropriate to design contexts.  
* **LO8**: *Use appropriate English language skills to read, interpret, and respond to design briefs and explain how designs can be adapted for diverse cultural contexts.*

Using skills from Lesson 2, complete the following:

3.1 Create a digital concept board (using Pinterest, Adobe Express, or any digital tool of your choice) that:

* Contains 5-10 images related to your design challenge  
* Shows a cohesive color palette  
* Includes typography examples that might work for your design  
* Demonstrates a clear visual direction for your project

3.2 Write brief notes about:

* How your concept board reflects the target audience  
* Which design elements and principles are most prominent in your chosen images  
* How cultural or contextual factors influenced your visual choices  
* How this mood board will guide your design decisions

## **Task 4: Project Planning and Reflection**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO6:** Demonstrate effective time management, self-directed learning, and independent working practices when following the steps of a design project from concept to delivery.  
* **LO5:** Reflect on own progress and identify areas for improvement and next steps using rubrics for self-evaluation.

4.1 Apply your understanding of project planning by creating:

* A basic project timeline for completing your design challenge  
* Task breakdown with estimated time for each component  
* List of resources and tools needed to complete the project

4.2 Reflect on your design process:

* For your project plan, write brief notes about:  
  * How you applied time management techniques from Lesson 2  
  * Which stages of the design process you anticipate will take the most time  
  * How you'll address potential obstacles in your workflow  
  * What you've learned about your personal design process

**Remember:** Focus on showing your thinking rather than creating perfect designs. Keep your work organized and show that you understand the key ideas from Lessons 1 and 2\. What matters most is how you approach the design process and think about your creative choices.
