# **Assignment 0.4: Summative (Design Brief Response and Portfolio Development)**

This final project brings together the skills you've built throughout the Graphic Design Foundation Unit. You'll create a set of designs in response to a client brief, using professional design tools to develop a cohesive visual identity. Your work will show your understanding of design principles, project management, and visual problem-solving.

**Client Brief**: [Assignment 0.4 Creative Brief: Woodland Arts Festival](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eeh0WSSD2i69tXUM-EpGyqTKA93QgRFgbqDml5ZgmVU/edit?tab=t.0)

## **Task 1: Client Brief Analysis and Planning**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO2**: *Explore and develop creative responses using simple research, ideation and analysis methods relevant to design projects.*

## **Task 3: Design Review and Improvement**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* **LO1:** *Understand and describe key principles, processes, and terminology of graphic design including elements and principles of design, colour theory, and typography.*  
* **LO3:** *Apply core technical methods to develop and present creative work, including basic navigation of online learning platforms and industry-standard design software.*

3.1 **Design Review:**

* Show your logo at three different sizes (small, medium, large) \- include pixel measurements for height and width   
* Get feedback from two friends or family members on your designs  
* Make at least one improvement based on feedback  
* Write brief notes about what you changed and why

3.2 **File Organisation:**

* Save your final logo as both JPG and PNG files  
* Save your social media banner as a JPG  
* Keep your working files organized in clearly named folders  
* List any fonts you used

3.3 **Simple Presentation:**

* Create 4-5 slides showing:  
  * Your initial sketches  
  * Your final designs  
  * Where the designs might be used (e.g., social media, website)  
  * What you learned from the project

## **Task 4: Project Review**

**Learning Outcomes Assessed:**

* LO4: Communicate ideas effectively through basic visual, written and verbal formats appropriate to design contexts.  
* **LO5**: Reflect on own progress and identify areas for improvement and next steps using rubrics for self-evaluation.  
* LO7: Use basic maths or geometric concepts to support creative tasks and problem-solving in design compositions and layouts.  
* LO8: Use appropriate English language skills to read, interpret, and respond to design briefs and explain how designs can be adapted for diverse cultural contexts.

4.1 **Project Analysis (1500 words):**

* Evaluate how well your designs meet the brief  
* Describe how you handled challenges  
* Explain how you used feedback  
* Identify areas for future development  
* Write a short note (2â€“3 sentences) describing any geometric structures you used (grids, proportions, modular systems) and how they help with scalability and balance.

4.2 **Skills Assessment (150 words):**

* List technical skills gained  
* Note areas needing development  
* Set specific learning goals  
* Identify resources for improvement

4.3 **Professional Context (150 words):**
