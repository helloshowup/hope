As you transition from hand drawing materials and textures, understanding color relationships will enhance your ability to document and communicate your design ideas effectively through photography. This knowledge forms a crucial bridge between your manual representation skills and the digital design tools you'll explore in upcoming lessons, providing you with a comprehensive foundation for your design practice.\n\n## 1. Color Fundamentals\n\n### The Color Wheel: Your Design Compass\n\nThe color wheel is an essential tool that reveals relationships between colors in a systematic way:\n\n- **Primary colors**: Red, yellow, and blue (cannot be created by mixing other colors)\n- **Secondary colors**: Orange, green, and purple (created by mixing primary colors)\n- **Tertiary colors**: Colors created by mixing primary and secondary colors\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps you make informed design decisions rather than relying solely on intuition.\n\n### Color Properties: The Three Dimensions\n\nEach color has three key properties that you'll need to consider in your design work:\n- **Hue**: The color itself (red, blue, yellow, etc.)\n- **Value**: The lightness or darkness of a color\n- **Saturation**: The intensity or purity of a color\n\n> **Practical Example**: A pale blue wall (low saturation, high value) creates a very different feeling than a deep navy blue wall (low saturation, low value) or a bright electric blue wall (high saturation, medium value).\n\n### Color Schemes: Creating Harmony\n\nProfessional designers use established color relationships to create cohesive spaces:\n\n- **Monochromatic**: Different tints, tones, and shades of a single color\n- **Analogous**: Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel\n- **Complementary**: Colors opposite each other on the color wheel\n- **Split-complementary**: A color plus the two colors adjacent to its complement\n- **Triadic**: Three colors equally spaced around the color wheel\n\n> **Practice Activity**: Find a magazine image of an interior space you like. Identify which color scheme is being used and sketch a simple color wheel marking the relationships between the colors.\n\n## 2. Application Methods\n\n### Documenting Color Accurately\n\nProfessional color documentation requires precision and consistency:\n\n1. **Color reference systems**: Learn to use standard systems like Pantone, RAL, or manufacturer codes\n2. **Photography techniques**:\n   - Use proper white balance settings on your camera\n   - Photograph in consistent lighting conditions\n   - Include color reference cards in test shots\n\n3. **Digital color values**: Understand RGB, CMYK, and HEX codes for digital documentation\n\n> **Common Mistake**: Many beginners photograph spaces without considering how lighting affects color appearance. Always note lighting conditions when documenting colors.\n\n### The Professional Selection Process\n\nDeveloping a color scheme follows a structured approach:\n\n1. Consider the space's function and desired emotional response\n2. Evaluate natural and artificial lighting conditions\n3. Select a dominant color (typically 60% of the space)\n4. Choose secondary colors (about 30% of the space)\n5. Add accent colors (approximately 10% of the space)\n6. Test combinations under different lighting conditions\n\n> **Hands-On Exercise**: Create three different color schemes for a bedroom using the 60-30-10 rule. For each scheme, collect physical color samples and photograph them together under both natural and artificial light.\n\n### Creating Professional Presentations\n\nYour color documentation should include:\n\n- Physical color boards with actual material samples\n- Photographs showing colors in context\n- Digital color palettes with precise color codes\n- Notes on how colors appear under different lighting conditions\n\n## 3. Discussion Topics\n\n### Analyzing Professional Color Photography\n\nWhen examining interior design photography, consider:\n\n- How does the photographer capture the true colors of the space?\n- How do colors interact with natural and artificial light in the photographs?\n- What techniques emphasize certain color relationships?\n- How does the composition highlight the color scheme?\n\n> **Reflection Question**: How might the same color scheme photograph differently at different times of day? Why is this important to consider when documenting your designs?\n\n### Developing Critical Feedback Skills\n\nWhen discussing color schemes with peers:\n\n- Reference specific color theory principles\n- Consider functional requirements alongside aesthetics\n- Discuss how colors might appear in photographs versus reality\n- Suggest specific adjustments rather than general criticism\n\n### Connecting to Your Design Journey\n\nThe color knowledge you're gaining now builds directly on your understanding of materials and textures while preparing you for digital design work:\n\n- Your material representation skills help you understand how colors interact with different surfaces\n- Your color documentation methods will translate directly to the digital environment\n- The photography skills you develop now will be enhanced by the digital tools in your next module\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding color relationships is essential for creating intentional, effective interior designs. By mastering color fundamentals, documentation methods through photography, and critical analysis, you're developing professional skills that will distinguish your work. As you move forward to Digital Design Tools, you'll learn how to translate these color principles into digital formats, maintaining the connection between hand-drawn techniques, photography, and computer-aided design.\n\n## Recommended Resources\n\n- **Color Theory for Designers** by Cameron Chapman\n- **Photographing Interior Design** by Helen Bartlett\n- **The Color Scheme Bible** by Anna Starmer\n- **Adobe Color Wheel** (online tool): https://color.adobe.com\n\n## Assessment Preparation\n\nBe prepared to:\n- Identify color schemes in professional interior photographs\n- Document a space using proper color photography techniques\n- Create a color board with physical and digital components\n- Explain how your color choices support the function of a space\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn our upcoming Digital Design Tools Introduction, you'll learn how to organize your color photography files and enhance them using basic digital tools, creating a seamless workflow from physical to digital design documentation.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- **Color harmony**: The theory of combining colors in a pleasing arrangement\n- **White balance**: Camera setting that adjusts colors to appear natural under different lighting\n- **Color temperature**: The warmth or coolness of light, measured in Kelvin\n- **Color rendering index (CRI)**: How accurately a light source reveals colors compared to natural light\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\n1. How might your choice of color scheme affect the perceived size of a space in photographs?\n2. In what ways do cultural associations with colors influence design decisions?\n3. How can you ensure your color documentation accurately represents your design intent?\n\n## Notes\n\nRemember to bring your camera or smartphone to the next class for practical color photography exercises.\n\n## References\n\n- Eiseman, L.
