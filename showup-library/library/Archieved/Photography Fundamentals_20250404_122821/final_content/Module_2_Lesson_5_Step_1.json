These skills connect your hand-drawing abilities with digital techniques, helping you communicate your design vision clearly while building a professional portfolio that demonstrates both your creative and technical abilities.\n\n## 1. Layout Fundamentals\n\n### Board Organisation: Creating Visual Flow\n\nEffective presentation boards guide the viewer's eye purposefully through your content. Think of your board as a visual story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n\n**Key Principle:** Establish a grid system before placing elements. This invisible structure creates order and professionalism in your presentation.\n\n> **Over to You:** Take a recent design project and sketch three different possible board layouts on paper. Which arrangement tells your design story most effectively? Then photograph your workspace and sketch a grid overlay, identifying where key elements would be placed for maximum impact.\n\n### Hierarchy in Visual Communication\n\nHierarchy determines what viewers notice first, second, and third in your presentation. Consider these three levels:\n\n1. **Primary elements** (largest, boldest) - typically your main concept imagery\n2. **Secondary elements** (medium emphasis) - supporting drawings and details\n3. **Tertiary elements** (smallest) - text, dimensions, and notes\n\n**Common Misconception:** Many beginners try to give equal prominence to all elements. Remember that effective communication requires prioritising information.\n\n### Composition Techniques\n\nComposition is the arrangement of visual elements that creates harmony and interest. Strong composition skills transform even simple photographs into compelling visual statements.\n\n**Key Composition Techniques:**\n- Rule of thirds: Place key elements at intersection points of a 3\u00d73 grid\n- Leading lines: Use natural lines to direct the viewer's eye\n- Framing: Use foreground elements to create depth\n- Balance: Distribute visual weight appropriately across the image\n\n**Real-World Application:** Professional interior photographers carefully compose each shot to highlight a space's best features while downplaying any weaknesses.\n\n### Professional Examples\n\nStudy how these techniques appear in professional practice:\n\n- **Editorial photography:** Notice how interior design magazines use consistent layout templates with clear hierarchies\n- **Design portfolios:** Observe how professionals pair overview shots with detail images to tell a complete story\n- **Presentation boards:** See how hand-drawn elements and photographs complement each other in award-winning presentations\n\n## 2. Technical Integration\n\n### Drawing Presentation Enhancement\n\nYour hand drawings gain professional polish when properly photographed and integrated into digital presentations.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Use natural, diffused lighting to avoid harsh shadows\n- Position camera directly above drawings to prevent distortion\n- Include a scale reference when appropriate\n- Clean the background of distracting elements\n\n**Connection to Previous Learning:** Remember the file organisation systems you learnt in the Digital Design Tools Introduction. Apply those same principles when organising your photography assets.\n\n### Digital Enhancement Techniques\n\nDigital tools allow you to refine and enhance your photographic documentation without compromising authenticity.\n\n**Key Enhancement Approaches:**\n- Adjust brightness/contrast to improve clarity\n- Correct perspective distortion in architectural photographs\n- Apply subtle colour correction to maintain material accuracy\n- Remove distracting elements that detract from the design focus\n\n> **Over to You:** How might digital enhancement help communicate your design intent more clearly without overshadowing the authentic quality of hand drawings?\n\n### File Preparation for Multiple Uses\n\nDifferent presentation contexts require different file specifications.\n\n**File Preparation Guidelines:**\n- Resolution: 300dpi (dots per inch) for print, 72-150dpi for screen presentation\n- Colour mode: CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) for print, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) for screen\n- File formats: PDF for final submissions, JPG for drafts, PNG for transparency needs\n- Implement consistent naming conventions that connect to your project organisation\n\n### Quality Control Checklist\n\nBefore finalising any presentation, conduct a thorough quality assessment:\n\n- Are images sharp and properly exposed?\n- Is colour accuracy maintained across all images?\n- Do the photographs effectively communicate the design intent?\n- Are file sizes appropriate for the intended use?\n- Is there consistent visual language across all presentation elements?\n- Check spelling and grammar - errors undermine professionalism\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeveloping strong photography skills transforms how you document and present your interior design work. These techniques bridge the gap between your hand-drawing abilities and digital presentation methods, creating a cohesive professional approach.\n\nIn your upcoming Design Documentation Project, you'll apply these presentation skills to create a thorough design package that meets professional standards. The quality of your photography and presentation will directly impact how effectively your design concepts are communicated and understood.\n\n## Practice Activity\n\nCreate a simple presentation board that includes at least one photograph and one hand-drawn element. Apply the layout principles discussed to establish a clear visual hierarchy that guides the viewer through your design story. This hands-on practice will help you develop the skills needed for your portfolio development.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n\n* Removed self-referential language like \"this module\" and replaced with direct statements about the content.\n* Added brief explanations for technical terms like \"dpi\" (dots per inch), \"CMYK\" and \"RGB\" to support learners without prior technical knowledge.\n* Simplified the introduction to be more direct and accessible for foundation-level learners.\n* Maintained all the practical activities and real-world connections that support the hands-on learning style identified in the learner profile.",
