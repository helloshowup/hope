Remove the formal \"Introduction\" heading and create a more engaging opening\n2. Convert American spelling to British (color \u2192 colour)\n3. Replace all instances of \"essential\" with more natural alternatives\n4. Add \"Over to You\" headings for reflection sections\n5. Make the language more conversational while maintaining professionalism\n6. Vary sentence structures to sound more human\n7. Reduce repetitive patterns and academic formality\n8. Create more direct connections to the learner's journey\n\nHere's the edited version:\n\n# Photography Fundamentals: Understanding Colour Relationships in Interior Design\n\nColour shapes how we experience spaces. It influences mood, defines areas, and communicates design intent without saying a word. As you move beyond hand-drawing materials and textures, understanding colour relationships will strengthen your ability to document and communicate design ideas through photography. This knowledge bridges your manual representation skills with the digital design tools you'll explore soon, giving you a well-rounded foundation for your design practice.\n\n## 1. Colour Fundamentals\n\n### The Colour Wheel: Your Design Compass\n\nThe colour wheel reveals relationships between colours in a systematic way:\n\n- **Primary colours**: Red, yellow, and blue (cannot be created by mixing other colours)\n- **Secondary colours**: Orange, green, and purple (created by mixing primary colours)\n- **Tertiary colours**: Colours created by mixing primary and secondary colours\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps you make informed design decisions rather than relying solely on gut feeling.\n\n### Colour Properties: The Three Dimensions\n\nEach colour has three key properties to consider in your design work:\n- **Hue**: The colour itself (red, blue, yellow, etc.)\n- **Value**: The lightness or darkness of a colour\n- **Saturation**: The intensity or purity of a colour\n\n> **Practical Example**: A pale blue wall (low saturation, high value) creates a very different feeling than a deep navy blue wall (low saturation, low value) or a bright electric blue wall (high saturation, medium value).\n\n### Colour Schemes: Creating Harmony\n\nProfessional designers use established colour relationships to create cohesive spaces:\n\n- **Monochromatic**: Different tints, tones, and shades of a single colour\n- **Analogous**: Colours adjacent to each other on the colour wheel\n- **Complementary**: Colours opposite each other on the colour wheel\n- **Split-complementary**: A colour plus the two colours adjacent to its complement\n- **Triadic**: Three colours equally spaced around the colour wheel\n\n> **Over to You**: Find a magazine image of an interior space you like. Identify which colour scheme is being used and sketch a simple colour wheel marking the relationships between the colours.\n\n## 2. Application Methods\n\n### Documenting Colour Accurately\n\nProfessional colour documentation requires precision and consistency:\n\n1. **Colour reference systems**: Learn to use standard systems like Pantone, RAL, or manufacturer codes\n2. **Photography techniques**:\n   - Use proper white balance settings on your camera\n   - Photograph in consistent lighting conditions\n   - Include colour reference cards in test shots\n\n3. **Digital colour values**: Understand RGB, CMYK, and HEX codes for digital documentation\n\n> **Common Mistake**: Many beginners photograph spaces without considering how lighting affects colour appearance. Always note lighting conditions when documenting colours.\n\n### The Professional Selection Process\n\nDeveloping a colour scheme follows a structured approach:\n\n1. Consider the space's function and desired emotional response\n2. Evaluate natural and artificial lighting conditions\n3. Select a dominant colour (typically 60% of the space)\n4. Choose secondary colours (about 30% of the space)\n5. Add accent colours (approximately 10% of the space)\n6. Test combinations under different lighting conditions\n\n> **Over to You**: Create three different colour schemes for a bedroom using the 60-30-10 rule. For each scheme, collect physical colour samples and photograph them together under both natural and artificial light.\n\n### Creating Professional Presentations\n\nYour colour documentation should include:\n\n- Physical colour boards with actual material samples\n- Photographs showing colours in context\n- Digital colour palettes with precise colour codes\n- Notes on how colours appear under different lighting conditions\n\n## 3. Discussion Topics\n\n### Analysing Professional Colour Photography\n\nWhen examining interior design photography, consider:\n\n- How does the photographer capture the true colours of the space?\n- How do colours interact with natural and artificial light in the photographs?\n- What techniques emphasise certain colour relationships?\n- How does the composition highlight the colour scheme?\n\n> **Over to You**: How might the same colour scheme photograph differently at different times of day? Why is this important to consider when documenting your designs?\n\n### Developing Critical Feedback Skills\n\nWhen discussing colour schemes with peers:\n\n- Reference specific colour theory principles\n- Consider functional requirements alongside aesthetics\n- Discuss how colours might appear in photographs versus reality\n- Suggest specific adjustments rather than general criticism\n\n### Connecting to Your Design Journey\n\nThe colour knowledge you're gaining now builds directly on your understanding of materials and textures while preparing you for digital design work:\n\n- Your material representation skills help you understand how colours interact with different surfaces\n- Your colour documentation methods will translate directly to the digital environment\n- The photography skills you develop now will be enhanced by the digital tools in your next lessons\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding colour relationships is fundamental for creating intentional, effective interior designs. By grasping colour fundamentals, documentation methods through photography, and critical analysis, you're developing professional skills that will set your work apart. As you move forward to Digital Design Tools, you'll learn how to translate these colour principles into digital formats, maintaining the connection between hand-drawn techniques, photography, and computer-aided design.\n\n## Recommended Resources\n\n- **Colour Theory for Designers** by Cameron Chapman\n- **Photographing Interior Design** by Helen Bartlett\n- **The Colour Scheme Bible** by Anna Starmer\n- **Adobe Colour Wheel** (online tool): https://color.adobe.com\n\n## Assessment Preparation\n\nBe prepared to:\n- Identify colour schemes in professional interior photographs\n- Document a space using proper colour photography techniques\n- Create a colour board with physical and digital components\n- Explain how your colour choices support the function of a space\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe upcoming Digital Design Tools Introduction will cover organising your colour photography files and enhancing them using basic digital tools, creating a seamless workflow from physical to digital design documentation.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- **Colour harmony**: The theory of combining colours in a pleasing arrangement\n- **White balance**: Camera setting that adjusts colours to appear natural under different lighting\n- **Colour temperature**: The warmth or coolness of light, measured in Kelvin\n- **Colour rendering index (CRI)**: How accurately a light source reveals colours compared to natural light\n\n## Over to You\n\n1.
