# NOTE: INFOGRAPHIC ALREADY DESIGNED

 **\-oal: Visually communicate key typography principles for persuasive design, building on the psychological foundations established in Step 3\.**

**Infographic Sections & Content:**

## **Section I. Typography: The Voice of Visual Persuasion**

**Core Concept: Typography works as a powerful persuasive tool that engages both System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (analytical) thinking processes, as introduced in our psychology of visual persuasion module.**

**Typography creates immediate emotional responses before content meaning is processed**

**Typography physically embodies brand voice, directly impacting perceptions of trustworthiness and authority**

**Strategic typography guides viewers through persuasive pathways, leveraging attention mechanisms we studied in Step 3**

## **Section II. Psychological Impact of Font Selection**

**Core Concepts:**

* **Font classifications trigger specific cognitive and emotional responses that can be strategically leveraged**  
* **Effective font selection aligns typographic personality with persuasive goals and brand positioning**

**Font Psychology Chart:**

* **Serif: Tradition, reliability, authority (Financial, legal, luxury)**  
* **Sans Serif: Modernism, clarity, objectivity (Tech, healthcare, contemporary)**  
* **Script: Personality, elegance, human touch (Beauty, weddings, artisanal)**  
* **Display: Attention-grabbing, distinctiveness (Headlines, advertising)**  
* **Monospace: Precision, functionality, technology (Technical documentation)**

**Strategic Font Pairing: Creating psychological tension through contrasting fonts captures attention by creating pattern interruptions (connecting to the selective attention principles from Step 3\)**

## **Section III. Typography as Persuasive Structure**

**Core Concept: Typographic hierarchy creates clear persuasive pathways that guide viewers through information in a predetermined sequence, building on the cognitive processing principles we explored previously.**

**Typographic Weight & Size: How boldness and size variations control attention flow and establish information priorities**

**\[Image placeholder: Example showing how weight and size direct eye movement through content\]**

**The 3-Second Rule: Effective persuasive typography communicates key messages within the attention threshold we studied in visual psychology**

**Reading Pattern Design: How typography can be arranged to work with F-pattern and Z-pattern reading behaviours**

**\[Image placeholder: Side-by-side examples of layouts optimized for F-pattern and Z-pattern reading\]**

**Contrast & Spacing: Using typographic contrast to create visual salience that directs attention to key persuasive elements**

**\[Image placeholder: Before/after examples showing how contrast and spacing improve hierarchical clarity\]**

## **Section IV. Typography in Persuasive Practice**

**Core Concept: Real-world applications demonstrating how typographic choices directly influence user behaviour and decision-making.**

**Before/After Comparisons: Visual examples showing typographic improvements and their measurable persuasive impact**

**\[Image placeholder: Case study of a website or app interface before and after typographic optimisation\]**

**Cross-Platform Typography: How responsive typography maintains persuasive qualities across different contexts while adapting to cognitive load requirements**
