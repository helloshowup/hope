# **Step 9: The Ethics of Persuasive Design**

## **Understanding Ethical Design**

As designers, we shape how people understand and interact with information. Our work is able to influence behaviour and decisions, shapes, perceptions and attitudes, and impact individual and community wellbeing. This skillset demands thoughtful ethical consideration, especially given the power imbalance between designers and audiences—we possess specialised knowledge about visual persuasion techniques that our audiences typically don't understand. We create systems that guide user choices—whether they're aware of this influence or not.

## **Core Ethical Principles**

### **Respect for Autonomy**

Ethical persuasive design honours user choice and control rather than exploiting cognitive biases. This means creating experiences that empower informed decisions instead of manipulating users toward predetermined outcomes. When users maintain agency within your design, they develop trust rather than feeling exploited.

**Example:** A fitness app like MyFitnessPal allows users to set their own achievable goals, provides clear options to adjust notification frequency, and offers the ability to opt out of reminders altogether.

**Counter-example:** A subscription-based fitness app that uses artificially urgent countdown timers to pressure users into immediate purchases, such as some early versions of Noom. The cancel subscription option is also buried in multiple steps, making it deliberately difficult to find.

*\[Image: A screenshot of the MyFitnessPal goal-setting interface compared to a manipulative subscription purchase timer. Caption: "Fig 2: Contrast between a fitness app that respects user autonomy (left) and one that employs manipulative techniques (right)."\]"\]*

### **Transparency**

Clear communication about persuasive intent forms the foundation of ethical practice. Disclose key information openly, such as how user data will be used, what commercial interests are involved, and what specific actions you're encouraging and avoid deceptive practices that hide your true purpose. Transparent design acknowledges that users deserve to understand how and why they're being guided toward certain actions or conclusions.

**Example:** Charity: Water's donation platform ([https://www.charitywater.org/donate](https://www.charitywater.org/donate)) demonstrates donation transparency by clearly showing how funds are allocated, specifying the percentage used for administration versus field projects.

*\[Image: A screenshot of Charity: Water's fund allocation graphic. Caption: "Fig 3: Ethical donation interface demonstrating transparency in fund allocation and impact reporting."\]*

### **Beneficence**

Design with genuine user benefit in mind by asking: "Does this truly serve the audience's interests?" Consider long-term impacts beyond immediate business goals and prioritise positive outcomes that enhance users' lives. Beneficent design creates value that extends beyond mere engagement metrics.

**Example:** Instagram's "Take a Break" feature encourages users to reflect on their screen time by suggesting breaks after a set amount of usage. This promotes healthier habits and prioritises digital wellbeing over maximising app usage.

### **Non-maleficence**

Avoiding harm requires careful consideration of unintended consequences, especially for vulnerable users. Evaluate how your design might affect different groups, including those with limited digital literacy or cognitive impairments. Ethical designers anticipate potential negative effects and modify their approach accordingly.

**Example:** Amazon's shopping cart transparently displays all costs, including shipping and taxes, before the user proceeds to the final checkout step. This prevents unexpected surprises and maintains trust. Visit an example: [https://www.amazon.com/](https://www.amazon.com/).

*\[Image: A mock-up of Amazon's checkout interface showing clear itemised pricing, including shipping fees. Caption: "Fig 5: Ethical e-commerce interface (left) showing transparent pricing versus hidden fee approach (right)."\]*

### **Justice**

Fair representation ensures your persuasive work doesn't privilege certain groups while marginalising others. Consider diverse perspectives throughout your process and design inclusively for varied cultural backgrounds, abilities, and viewpoints. Just design distributes both benefits and potential risks equitably.

**Example:** The NHS's health campaigns in the UK often feature diverse representation in imagery and language, as seen in their COVID-19 vaccination materials. Accessible formats such as Easy Read documents and translations for multiple languages are provided ([https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/)).

## **Communication Ethics in Practice**

### **Truthful Communication**

When creating persuasive designs, present accurate information without distortion, even when attempting to evoke emotional responses. Provide proper context that allows users to form meaningful interpretations. Avoid misrepresentation through selective presentation or manipulated visuals. Truth in design builds lasting credibility beyond short-term persuasive goals.

**Example:** An environmental campaign that uses actual, unmanipulated photography of environmental damage rather than staged or digitally exaggerated imagery to evoke concern.

*\[Image: Environmental campaign materials using authentic documentation. Caption: "Fig 7: Ethical environmental campaign using authentic photography rather than manipulated imagery"\]*

### **Cultural Awareness**

Your designs should respect cultural differences by understanding how symbols, colours, and imagery carry different meanings across contexts. Include diverse perspectives throughout your process to identify potential misinterpretations. Avoid stereotypes and bias by questioning your assumptions and seeking input from varied viewpoints.

**Example:** A global brand campaign that adapts colour schemes for different markets, recognising that colours like white (associated with purity in Western contexts) may symbolise mourning in some Asian cultures.

*\[Image: Global campaign adaptation examples across different cultures. Caption: "Fig 8: Cultural adaptations of a global brand campaign showing sensitivity to local meanings and contexts"\]*

### **Responsible Representation**

Consider carefully how your work portrays different groups and influences societal narratives. Visual choices can reinforce or challenge harmful stereotypes in ways that impact cultural understanding. Responsible designers recognise their work doesn't exist in isolation but contributes to broader social discourse about who is valued and represented.

**Example:** An advertising campaign that consciously avoids gender stereotypes by showing men in nurturing roles and women in leadership positions, helping to normalize these realities rather than reinforcing outdated expectations.

## **Case Study: NYC "Pouring on the Pounds" Campaign**

For full details, see: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cdp/pouring-onthepounds-comm-action-kit.pdf](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cdp/pouring-pounds.pdf).

The NYC "Pouring on the Pounds" anti-sugary drink campaign demonstrates ethical persuasive design that balances impact with responsibility.

### **Ethical Approach**

The campaign used striking imagery showing fat being poured from drink containers but maintained ethical integrity through several key decisions. It relied on scientifically accurate representations of sugar content rather than exaggeration. The campaign focused on behaviour change rather than stigmatising individuals, creating proportional visual impact to the actual health risk (the visceral imagery matched the severity of health consequences without overstatement) while offering clear alternatives and actionable steps.

**Ethical tensions:** The campaign team navigated tensions between creating attention-grabbing visuals that would motivate behaviour change while avoiding fat-shaming or stigmatising individuals. They also balanced scientific accuracy with emotional impact, ensuring the message was both evidence-based and compelling.

### **Design Execution**

The campaign balanced persuasive power with ethical responsibility through truthful yet attention-grabbing visuals that avoided exaggeration. Its direct messaging empowered rather than shamed audiences, using inclusive imagery that represented diverse populations. By providing clear health information that respected viewer autonomy, the campaign demonstrated how powerful persuasion can remain ethically sound.

## **Over to You: Analysing Ethical Design in Practice**

Now that we've explored ethical principles and seen how they were applied in the "Pouring on the Pounds" campaign, it's your turn to develop your ethical analysis skills. Choose one or more of these discussion prompts to explore ethical dimensions of persuasive design:

### **Analysing the Case Study**

**Your challenge:** Examine the NYC "Pouring on the Pounds" campaign through the lens of potential ethical tensions. How did the designers balance the need for emotional impact with truthful representation? Identify one specific visual or messaging element that walks this line effectively. Could the campaign have achieved the same behavioral results with a less provocative approach? What ethical trade-offs might have been discussed during the design process?

### **Power and Responsibility**

**Your challenge:** The "Pouring on the Pounds" campaign came from a government health department—an authority with significant public trust. How does the source of a persuasive message affect its ethical implications? Would the same campaign have different ethical considerations if created by an anti-sugar activist group or a bottled water company? How should designers adjust their ethical approach based on who they represent?

### **Cultural Sensitivity**

**Your challenge:** Consider how the "Pouring on the Pounds" campaign might be received across different cultural contexts. Identify elements that might require adaptation for different communities. How might designers modify this campaign to maintain its persuasive power while respecting cultural differences around body image, food, or governmental authority? What universal ethical principles would remain constant regardless of cultural context?

### **Personal Design Reflection**

**Your challenge:** Think about a recent design project where you attempted to influence viewer behavior or perception. Apply the ethical framework from this lesson by addressing:

1. How did you balance persuasive effectiveness with ethical responsibility?  
2. Which ethical principles (autonomy, transparency, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) did your design successfully uphold? Which might have been compromised?  
3. If you could redesign this project with your current ethical understanding, what specific changes would you make?  
4. What process could you implement in future projects to ensure ethical considerations are addressed from the beginning?

Share your analysis, including the type of project (no confidential details needed), the intended persuasive goal, and your ethical reflection. Be specific about visual and messaging choices and how they relate to ethical principles.

As you develop your analysis, remember that ethical design isn't about finding perfect solutions, but rather making thoughtful choices that balance persuasive goals with responsible practice. Your reflection will help build your capacity to make these judgments in your professional work.
