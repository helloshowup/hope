## **A Note on the Application Process**

These PDFs have been developed specifically as tools to help graphic design students apply persuasive principles systematically. They provide structured approaches to testing and evaluating your designs, but remember that creative design rarely follows a strictly linear path.

These frameworks are designed to help you think critically about how your designs influence audience response, but feel free to adapt them to your specific project needs.

The goal isn't just to complete worksheets—it's to develop a systematic approach to design evaluation that ensures your work achieves its persuasive objectives.

# **PDF 1: Persuasive Design Testing Workbook**

This workbook offers straightforward exercises to help you understand how your designs influence people. You don't need special equipment or large groups of participants – these activities can be completed with just a few classmates or friends. Each exercise will help you identify what's working and what could be improved in your persuasive designs.

## **Exercise 1: First Impression Test**

**Purpose:** Discover what people notice first and what they miss in your design.

**Materials:**

* Your design (digital or printed)  
* 3-5 friends or classmates  
* Coloured pens or sticky notes (3 colours)  
* Timer

**Process:**

1. **Quick View** (3 seconds)  
   * Show each person your design for exactly 3 seconds  
   * Ask them to mark with RED what they noticed first  
   * Ask them to mark with BLUE what they remember seeing  
   * Ask them to mark with GREEN what they didn't notice until asked  
2. **Documentation Template:**

| Element | % Noticed First | % Remembered | % Not Noticed | Priority for Revision |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Headline |  |  |  |  |
| Main image |  |  |  |  |
| Call to action |  |  |  |  |
| Logo |  |  |  |  |
| Supporting text |  |  |  |  |

3.   
   **Analysis Questions:**  
   * Does your intended focal point match what viewers notice first?  
   * Are critical persuasive elements being overlooked?  
   * What elements compete for attention unnecessarily?

## **Exercise 2: Design Journey Mapping**

**Purpose:** Trace how people's eyes move through your design and identify where they lose interest.

**Materials:**

* Your design  
* 2-3 people  
* Paper for notes

**Process:**

1. **Eye Movement:**  
   * Ask people to point to elements in the order they look at them  
   * Have them rate how interesting each part is (1-5 scale)  
   * Ask where they would either take action or lose interest  
2. **Journey Map:**

```
[START] → Element: __________ →  Interest Level (1-5): __ → Continue? Y/N
        → Element: __________ →  Interest Level (1-5): __ → Continue? Y/N
        → Element: __________ →  Interest Level (1-5): __ → Continue? Y/N
        → [DECISION POINT] → Action taken: __________________
```

3.   
   **Optimization Questions:**  
   * Where do viewers commonly exit before completing the desired action?  
   * Which elements have the highest and lowest interest ratings?  
   * How can you strengthen weak links in the viewer's journey?

## **Exercise 3: Action Trigger Analysis**

**Purpose:** Identify which parts of your design make people want to take action.

**Materials:**

* Your design  
* An alternative version of your design (or a competitor's design)  
* Simple recording sheet  
* 3-5 people

**Process:**

1. **Design Comparison:**  
   * Show both designs  
   * Ask: "Which design makes you more likely to \[desired action\]?"  
   * Follow up: "What specific element influenced your decision most?"  
   * Ask: "Why did this part stand out to you?"  
2. **Action Element Tracker:**

| Design Element | Times Identified as Key Motivator | Comments | Persuasion Technique |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

3.   
   **Link to Theory:**  
   * For each identified motivating element, note which persuasion principle it employs:  
     * Reciprocity  
     * Commitment/Consistency  
     * Social Proof  
     * Authority  
     * Liking  
     * Scarcity  
     * Unity

## **Exercise 4: Emotional Response Assessment**

**Purpose:** Understand how your design makes people feel.

**Materials:**

* Your design (divided into 3-5 main areas)  
* List of basic emotions (happy, sad, confused, excited, calm, etc.)  
* Simple response sheet  
* 2-4 people

**Process:**

1. **Feeling Finder:**  
   * Identify 3-5 key areas of your design  
   * Ask people what feeling each area gives them  
   * Rate intensity of emotion (1-5)  
   * Note if this emotion supports or hinders persuasive goal  
2. **Emotional Impact Worksheet:**

| Design Area | Dominant Emotion | Intensity (1-5) | Supports Goal? (Y/N) | Suggested Revision |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. |  |  |  |  |
| 2\. |  |  |  |  |
| 3\. |  |  |  |  |

3.   
   **Feeling Check:**  
   * Are the emotions evoked aligned with your persuasive intent?  
   * Which areas create emotional disconnects?  
   * How can emotional transitions be smoothed between elements?

## **Implementation Guide**

For maximum effectiveness, follow this testing order:

1. Start with the First Impression Test to identify baseline visibility issues  
2. Apply initial corrections, then conduct Design Journey Mapping  
3. Refine flow issues, then perform Action Trigger Analysis  
4. Make final adjustments, then verify with Emotional Response Assessment

## **Connection to Quality Assurance Framework**

These exercises establish the foundation for checking how well your designs work. Each exercise addresses specific aspects of persuasive effectiveness:

1. **First Impression Test** → Visibility & Initial Engagement  
2. **Design Journey** → Logical Flow & Comprehension  
3. **Action Trigger Analysis** → Action Motivation & Conversion  
4. **Emotion Assessment** → Psychological Engagement & Retention

By using these simple testing methods, you'll develop a reliable way to check if your designs are working, which you can use on all your future projects.

### **DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS LIST**

| \# | Design Element/Change | Impact (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Quadrant |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Make my headline bigger and bolder | 5 | 1 | Quick Win |
| 2 | Change colour scheme to warmer tones | 4 | 2 | Quick Win |
| 3 | Add a special offer coupon | 4 | 1 | Quick Win |
| 4 | Create my own illustration instead of using clip art | 3 | 5 | Major Project |

| 6 | Fix spacing between menu items | 2 | 1 | Fill-in |
| 7 | Create decorative borders for each section | 2 | 4 | Avoid |
| 8 | Use fancy script fonts for all headings | 1 | 3 | Avoid |

### **ACTION PLAN**

**QUICK WINS (High Impact, Low Effort):**

* Enlarge headline. 7/8 testers spotted larger version immediately. Current version missed completely.  
* Switch to warm browns/oranges. Blues tested "too cold" for coffee. Warm palette triggered stronger purchase intent.  
* Add coupon. Tests show deals get noticed first. Implementation: 15 minutes.

**MAJOR PROJECTS (High Impact, High Effort):**

* Custom illustration vs. clip art. Looks professional but requires new skills. Plan: 2 weeks learning \+ 1 week execution.  
* QR code to digital menu. Popular request. Blockers: need code generator \+ create online menu first.enu first.

**FILL-INS (Low Impact, Low Effort):**

* Adjust menu spacing. Quick fix. Low priority \- only 2/10 testers mentioned.

**AVOID (Low Impact, High Effort):**

* Decorative borders. Personal preference only. No tester interest. Time sink.  
* Script fonts for headings. Tested poorly for readability. Extensive font hunting required.

### **MY THOUGHTS**

**Key findings:**

• First Impression Test: Large text and offers capture attention first

• Action Trigger Analysis: Special offers and warm colours drive action

**Implementation plan:**

• Weekend: Complete all Quick Wins (3-4 hours total)

• Next week: Decision on Major Projects \- assignment vs. portfolio version

**Bottom line:** Matrix revealed I was obsessing over low-impact decorative elements while missing high-impact, low-effort improvements.

# **PDF 6: Sample Advertisement Analysis (Completed Example)**

**Brand/Product:** Costa Coffee Seasonal Menu **Media Type:** Print Advertisement

**Advertisement Link/Source:** March 2025 issue of Food Magazine, p.37

### **PURPOSE**

Learn from existing advertisements by breaking down how they use visual elements and persuasive techniques to influence their audience.

### **BASIC INFORMATION**

**Target Audience:** Urban professionals, 25-45, coffee enthusiasts

**Primary Message:** New spring drinks offer premium experience with ethical ingredients

**Call to Action:** "Try our new spring menu today \- in store or via app"

### **VISUAL ELEMENTS BREAKDOWN**

| Visual Element | Description | Purpose/Effect | Effectiveness (1-5) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Colour Scheme** | Warm browns/oranges with accent green | Associates with coffee while adding freshness element | 5 |
| **Typography** | Sans serif headline, script for seasonal items | Balances modern feel with handcrafted quality | 4 |
| **Imagery** | Close-up of drink with steam, blurred barista background | Creates sensory response and craftsman association | 5 |
| **Layout/Composition** | Z-pattern flow, product center-right | Guides eye from headline to product to CTA | 4 |
| **Logo/Branding** | Top left corner, 15% of total space | Establishes brand without dominating message | 3 |
| **White Space** | Moderate use, concentrated around product | Highlights product, creates premium feel | 4 |

☑ Storytelling (3/5) \- Example: Image narrative of coffee creation from bean to cup

☑ Problem-Solution Format (4/5) \- Example: "Tired of the same daily coffee? Discover our new flavours"

☐ Other (\_/5): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### **HIERARCHY ANALYSIS**

Number the elements in the order they draw attention (1 \= first noticed):

*1* Headline*2* Image*3* Call to Action*4* Brand*5* Body Text

### **EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION**

| Criterion | Rating (1-5) | Reasoning |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Attention-grabbing | 5 | Steam visually rises from cup \- creates movement in static image |
| Message clarity | 4 | Benefit clear but some menu items hard to read in script font |
| Persuasive power | 4 | Emotional trigger \+ practical offer \= effective combination |
| Memorability | 3 | Product stands out but overall design similar to competitors |
| Brand alignment | 5 | Perfectly extends brand identity while refreshing image |
| Call to action strength | 4 | Clear but could be more prominent in layout |

### **KEY TAKEAWAYS**

**Three strongest elements of this advertisement:**

• Perfect colour harmony \- warm tones create appetite appeal while green accents signal freshness

• Strategic composition \- Z-pattern naturally guides eyes to product then CTA

• Sensory triggers \- steam visual \+ descriptive words ("aromatic," "rich") engage multiple senses

**What could be improved:**

• Increase CTA size and contrast \- currently gets less attention than image

• Reduce text density in bottom third \- testing shows readers skip dense paragraphs

**Techniques I could apply in my own designs:**

• Use movement suggestion (like steam) to create dynamic feel in static images

• Position most important persuasive element (taste appeal) at natural eye-path intersection points

• Combine emotional appeal with practical offer for dual-motivation approach
