## **PDF 1: Decision tree for selecting appropriate research methods**

This decision tree guides you through selecting the most effective research method for your design project based on your specific needs, resources, and audience. Follow the questions to identify which approach will yield the most valuable insights.

### **Starting Point**

Begin by identifying your primary research objective:

**Are you trying to understand what your audience thinks and feels?**

(Qualitative research focuses on opinions, motivations, and emotional responses)

* If yes → Follow Path A (Qualitative Research)  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need measurable data to validate design decisions?**

(Quantitative research provides numerical data that can be analyzed statistically)

* If yes → Follow Path B (Quantitative Research)  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to observe how people interact with your design?**

(Observational research examines actual behavior rather than reported preferences)

* If yes → Follow Path C (Observational Research)  
* If no → Revisit your research needs

### **Path A: Qualitative Research Methods**

**Do you need in-depth understanding of motivations and attitudes?**

* If yes → Consider in-depth interviews or focus groups  
* If no → Continue

**Are you interested in emotional responses to visual elements?**

* If yes → Use visual response testing or projective techniques  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to understand how your audience categorises information?**

* If yes → Try card sorting exercises or cognitive mapping  
* If no → Consider contextual inquiry

### **Path B: Quantitative Research Methods**

**Do you need to compare different design approaches?**

* If yes → Implement A/B testing  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to collect feedback from a large audience?**

* If yes → Use online surveys with clear visual examples  
* If no → Continue

**Are you trying to understand user journeys through your design?**

* If yes → Apply digital analytics tracking  
* If no → Consider multivariate testing

### **Path C: Observational Research Methods**

**Can you observe users in their natural environment?**

* If yes → Use contextual inquiry or digital ethnography  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to track exactly what users look at?**

* If yes → Implement eye-tracking studies  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to understand the physical interaction with your design?**

* If yes → Set up usability testing sessions  
* If no → Consider heat mapping for digital designs

### **Method Selection Considerations**

When finalising your research method, consider these practical factors:

**Time Available:**

* Quick insights (1-2 days): Surveys, 5-second tests  
* Medium timeline (1-2 weeks): Remote user testing, A/B testing  
* Extended study (3+ weeks): In-depth interviews, contextual inquiry

**Budget Constraints:**

* Low budget: Social media polls, guerrilla testing, analytics review (essentially free options)  
* Medium budget: Online user testing platforms, survey tools (typically subscription-based services)  
* Higher budget: Eye-tracking studies, professional research recruitment (specialist equipment or expertise required)

**Research Expertise Required:**

* Minimal: Online surveys, feedback forms  
* Moderate: Usability testing, card sorting  
* Significant: Focus groups, in-depth analysis of qualitative data

Remember that combining complementary methods often provides the most comprehensive understanding of your audience. The best research approach frequently involves triangulating findings from multiple sources.

## **PDF 2: Objective Mapping template**

### **Crafting Effective Research Objectives**

Effective design research begins with clear objectives. This template guides you through creating SMART research objectives that address specific knowledge gaps about your audience, helping you gather actionable insights that directly inform your design decisions.

### **The SMART Framework for Design Research**

Research objectives should be:

* **Specific**: Precisely defines what information you need  
* **Measurable**: Includes criteria to determine when the objective is met  
* **Achievable**: Realistic given your resources and constraints  
* **Relevant**: Directly connects to your design challenge  
* **Time-bound**: Sets a clear timeframe for completion

### **Objective Mapping Process**

#### **Step 1: Identify Knowledge Gaps**

What don't you know about your audience that impacts your design effectiveness? Consider:

Knowledge Gap 1: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"I don't know which visual styles resonate emotionally with my target audience."*

Knowledge Gap 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"I'm unsure how my audience processes the hierarchy of information in my layouts."*

Knowledge Gap 3: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"I don't understand which colour palettes create the intended emotional response."*

#### **Step 2: Transform Gaps into SMART Objectives**

For each knowledge gap identified, create a corresponding SMART objective:

##### **Objective 1:**

* Specific: What exactly do you need to learn? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Measurable: How will you know when you've succeeded? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Achievable: What methods will you use? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Relevant: How will this inform your design? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Time-bound: When will you complete this? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Complete Objective 1: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"Determine the top three visual styles that evoke trust among healthcare professionals aged 35-55 through a combination of visual preference testing and semi-structured interviews with 15 participants by March 15th."*

##### **Objective 2:**

* Specific: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Measurable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Achievable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Relevant: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Time-bound: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Complete Objective 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

##### **Objective 3:**

* Specific: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Measurable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Achievable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Relevant: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Time-bound: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Complete Objective 3: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### **Step 3: Prioritization Matrix**

Use this table to prioritize which objectives to address first:

|  | Urgency (1-5) | Impact on Design (1-5) | Resource Requirements (1-5) | Total Score |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Objective 1 |  |  |  |  |
| Objective 2 |  |  |  |  |
| Objective 3 |  |  |  |  |

*Higher scores indicate higher priority. For Resource Requirements, higher scores indicate FEWER resources needed (easier to accomplish).*

#### **Step 4: Research Methods Selection**

Based on your objectives and the Decision Tree (PDF 1), which methods will you use for each objective?

Objective 1 Method(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Objective 2 Method(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Objective 3 Method(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Remember: Your research objectives directly inform which methods you select and how you'll implement them. Clear objectives lead to focused research that delivers actionable insights for your design process.

**Decision Making:**Purchase triggers: Peer recommendations, Sustainability valuesResearch habits: ModerateTrust indicators: Reviews, friend recommendations

Now, as Sarah, please give me your honest reaction to our new sustainable packaging design concept."

### **Design Presentation Methods**

**Descriptive method:** Provide a detailed written description of your design

*"The concept is a minimalist bamboo container for organic skincare products. The packaging features a matte finish in pale sage green with simple line illustrations of botanical ingredients. The brand name appears in a modern sans-serif font with messaging that emphasizes plastic reduction and biodegradability."*

**Image upload method:** In platforms that support image uploads (like ChatGPT with Vision), upload an image of your design and ask:

*"Here's an image of our sustainable packaging design. Based on Sarah's profile, what would be her first impression of this design? What aspects would appeal to her most, and what might she find problematic?"*

**Link method:** If your design is hosted online, provide a link (where supported):

*"You can view our sustainable packaging design concept at \[URL\]. As Sarah, what elements of this design would catch your attention first? Does this packaging align with your values and aesthetic preferences?"*

### **Sample Questions for AI Persona Testing**

Once you've established the persona role with AI, try asking questions like these:

* "What's your first impression of this design?"  
* "Which feature would you find most useful?"  
* "How would this fit into your daily routine?"  
* "What concerns would you have before purchasing?"  
* "What information would you need to make a decision?"  
* "Where would you expect to discover this product?"

Remember to:

* Ask the chatbot to take on the persona's characteristics and preferences.  
* Engage in simulated conversations about your product/service.  
* Test different messaging approaches and value propositions.  
* Gather insights about potential user reactions and pain points.  
* Refine your communication strategy based on these.

**Caution**: While AI simulations can provide valuable insights, remember they are approximations and should not replace actual user testing and research. It is very helpful as a brainstorming tool and exploratory exercise.

## **PDF 4: Visual Reaction Testing protocol**

Capture authentic first impressions of your designs through controlled 5-second exposure tests. This method reveals immediate emotional and cognitive responses before conscious analysis begins.

### **Materials Needed**

□ 3-5 design variations (digital or print)

□ Timer/stopwatch

□ Response forms

### **Testing Process**

#### **1\. Brief Participants (30 seconds)**

"You'll see several designs for 5 seconds each. Share your immediate reactions—there are no wrong answers."

#### **2\. Run Test (3-4 minutes per design)**

* Display design (5 seconds exactly)  
* Collect immediate response  
* Allow 1-minute break  
* Repeat for each variant

**Key:** Randomize design order between participants

#### **Sample Response Form:**

* Average emotional score  
* Message clarity rate  
* Action likelihood score  
* Most-noticed elements

Compare against objectives:

* Did viewers understand purpose?  
* Which design triggered desired action?  
* What elements drove engagement?

**Note:** When responses vary widely between participants, pay special attention to patterns within demographic groups or user types that match your target audience most closely.

## **PDF 5: Micro-Feedback Collection guide**

### **Quick-Response Design Feedback System**

Micro-feedback gathers rapid audience responses during design development, enabling swift iterations based on actual user reactions rather than assumptions.

### **Core Components**

#### **Collection Methods**

Choose one digital and one in-person method:

**Digital**

* Screenshot annotation (via [Markup.io](http://Markup.io) or similar)  
* Single-question popup surveys  
* Social media A/B polls

**In-Person**

* 30-second reaction cards  
* Dot voting on printed designs  
* Traffic light system (green/yellow/red stickers)

#### **Essential Questions**

Focus on these four areas:

1. First impression: "Which element caught your attention first?"  
2. Emotional response: "What one word describes how this makes you feel?"  
3. Message clarity: "What is the main message?"  
4. Action intent: "What would you do next based on this design?"

### **Implementation Process**

1. **Setup**  
* Choose 2-3 design aspects to evaluate  
* Create response tracking spreadsheet (with columns for participant ID, feedback type, specific comments, and action taken)  
* Set clear feedback timeframes (24-48 hours max)  
* When faced with conflicting research findings, prioritize those that align most closely with your primary project objectives or those that came from your most representative user groups  
2. **Collection**  
* Gather 5-10 responses per design iteration  
* Document exact design version with feedback  
* Note context of feedback collection  
3. **Analysis**  
* Act immediately when 3+ participants identify same issue  
* Flag patterns for review with 2+ similar responses  
* Document unique insights for future consideration  
4. **Integration**  
* Implement high-priority changes within 48 hours  
* Track changes made based on feedback  
* Verify improvements with next feedback round

Remember: Keep feedback rounds brief and focused. The goal is rapid improvement through consistent, small-scale testing rather than comprehensive evaluation.

## **PDF 6: Research-to-Design Translation matrix**

### **Bridging Research Insights and Design Decisions**

This visual decision-making tool helps designers translate audience research into specific design choices. Each research insight connects directly to visual elements, ensuring your design decisions are grounded in audience understanding rather than assumptions.

### **Matrix Components**

Complete each row in the matrix using these four columns:

1. Research Finding: What you learned about your audience  
2. Visual Impact: How this affects your design approach  
3. Design Elements: Specific visual components to create  
4. Measurement: How to check if your solution works

#### **Working Through the Matrix**

Step 1: Enter Your Research

* Write one clear finding per row  
* Focus on visual preferences and behaviors  
* Include specific data where possible

Example: "85% of users were drawn to bright colour accents in navigation elements" rather than "Users like bright colours"

Step 2: Identify Visual Impact

* Consider how the finding affects visual hierarchy  
* Note implications for colour, typography, and layout  
* Think about emotional responses

Example: "Bright colours should guide user journeys through the interface" rather than "Use bright colours"

Step 3: Specify Design Elements

* List exact visual components to create  
* Include colour values, font choices, or spacing  
* Detail any necessary variations

Example: "Create accent buttons using \#FF4B2B with 8px padding and hover state at 80% opacity" rather than "Make colourful buttons"

Step 4: Define Success Measures

* Choose metrics that focus on visual effectiveness  
* Include both quantitative and qualitative measures  
* Set specific targets

Example: "Achieve 40% faster task completion rate and positive user feedback on navigation clarity" rather than "Better usability"

### **Sample Matrix (Visual Design Focus)**

| Research Finding | Visual Impact | Design Elements | Measurement |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Users consistently miss secondary navigation options in current design | Visual hierarchy needs stronger differentiation between primary and secondary elements | Create two-tier navigation system: Primary \= Open Sans Bold 18px, Secondary \= Open Sans Regular 14px, with 25% opacity difference | Eye-tracking shows 90% of users notice both navigation tiers; task success rate improves by 30% |
| Brand colours evoke "corporate" feeling rather than desired "creative" association | Colour palette needs updating while maintaining brand recognition | Develop expanded palette: Primary blue shifts from \#1B4B8F to \#2B7CE8, add complementary accent colours \#FF6B6B and \#4ECDC4 | Audience survey shows 40% increase in "creative" brand association; maintains 90% brand recognition |
| Mobile users spend 3x longer finding contact information | Contact details need stronger visual presence on mobile | Design floating contact button with high contrast background (\#FF4B2B), persistent across mobile screens, 56px diameter | Reduce time to find contact info by 65%; achieve 25% higher tap rate on contact elements |

### **Implementation Tips**

1. Start with 3 key findings maximum for your first matrix  
2. Sketch quick thumbnails next to your Design Elements  
3. Test one row's changes before implementing others  
4. Document before/after visuals for comparison

When faced with conflicting research findings, which row takes priority? Consider:

1. Which finding impacts more users?  
2. Which addresses a critical user journey?  
3. Which aligns most closely with business goals?
