# Professional Practice: Case Studies in Complex Design

# IDEO's Approach to Multi-Stakeholder Design Projects

Complex design projects demand thoughtful approaches to balance competing priorities. Looking at real-world examples like university visual identity systems or nonprofit annual reports reveals valuable insights from design firms such as IDEO. Their work shows how well-structured methods help navigate projects involving multiple stakeholders—each bringing unique needs and expectations. Studying these professional approaches will equip you with practical strategies for tackling complex design challenges requiring both creative vision and systematic problem-solving.

## Reflective Models in Multi-Stakeholder Design

### The Human-Centred Design Triangle

IDEO frames every design challenge at the intersection of three essential considerations:
- **Desirability** (what people want)
- **Feasibility** (what is technically possible)
- **Viability** (what is financially sustainable)

This structure helps designers balance competing priorities. Take IDEO's redesign of Singapore's patient experience for the Ministry of Health. They needed to engage:
- Patients from diverse backgrounds
- Medical staff across different specialties
- Hospital operations teams
- Government health officials
- Insurance representatives

By mapping these stakeholders against the triangle, IDEO spotted where priorities aligned and where trade-offs needed discussion – a situation you'll face in nearly any complex design project you take on.

**Try This when a client's brief seems to pull your design in conflicting directions**: Map the project requirements onto the Human-Centered Design Triangle, sorting each element under desirability, feasibility, or viability. Spot where tensions exist between these areas and jot down possible compromise solutions. How might this visual approach help you explain necessary trade-offs to your client?

### The Five Whys Technique

"The Five Whys" is a technique IDEO uses to uncover deeper stakeholder needs beyond surface-level requests:

When hospital administrators requested "more efficient patient processing," IDEO designers repeatedly asked "why?" five times. This revealed the actual need wasn't just efficiency but reducing patient anxiety through better information flow – something that wouldn't have surfaced without deeper questioning.

This approach prevents you from solving the wrong problem, especially crucial when different stakeholders present competing priorities. You might wonder how this applies to graphic design specifically – imagine a client asking for a "more modern logo" and using this technique to discover they're actually worried about connecting with younger audiences or standing out from new competitors.

**Try This when a client makes a vague request like "make it pop more"**: Use the Five Whys technique in your next client conversation. When they request a change, respectfully ask "why?" after each response until you reach the core need (usually by the fifth why). Note these responses in your project files. What fundamental need did you uncover that wasn't obvious in their initial request?

## Collaborative Practices for Complex Projects

### Visualisation as Stakeholder Alignment

Visual thinking forms a key part of IDEO's approach to building shared understanding among diverse stakeholders who often speak different "languages" (technical, business, user-focused).

For their work with Ford, IDEO created experience maps that translated complex technical requirements, business constraints, and user needs into visual formats everyone could grasp. These visualisations became boundary objects – tools that bridged communication gaps between engineering, marketing, and executive teams.

Your visual communication skills put you in an ideal position to create these types of alignment tools – this is where your graphic design expertise becomes invaluable in the collaborative process.

**Try This when stakeholders seem to be talking past each other in meetings**: Draw up a simple visual diagram showing how different stakeholders' priorities connect to the central project goals. Use colours and minimal text to highlight relationships between competing needs. Share this visualization in your next meeting. How did this visual aid shift the conversation from conflict to collaboration?

### Prototype-Driven Conversations

Tangible prototypes focus stakeholder input more effectively than abstract discussions. When collaborating with PillPack (now Amazon Pharmacy), IDEO developed quick prototypes of medication management systems that gave healthcare providers, patients, and technical teams concrete examples to respond to.

The project coordinated multiple stakeholders:
- Patients with complex medication regimens
- Pharmacists with workflow requirements
- Insurance companies with compliance needs
- Regulatory bodies with safety standards

IDEO created a "stakeholder value map" showing how each group's needs could be met through interconnected design decisions. The resulting system satisfied regulatory requirements while delivering an intuitive patient experience.

**Try This when you're struggling to get meaningful feedback on a concept**: Create two distinctly different rough prototypes of your design idea that stakeholders can physically interact with. Present them side-by-side and ask specific comparison questions rather than open-ended feedback. What new insights emerged that wouldn't have surfaced from discussing abstract concepts?

### Co-Creation Sessions

IDEO runs workshops where stakeholders actively participate in the design process rather than simply viewing finished concepts. During their partnership with Planned Parenthood, they brought together healthcare providers, patients, administrators, and community advocates to collectively reimagine the patient experience through guided design activities.

**Try This when you notice stakeholders becoming disengaged from your design process**: Plan a 30-minute co-creation activity where stakeholders actively contribute to solving a specific design challenge using simple materials like sticky notes and markers. Give each person a clear role and ensure everyone contributes. How did direct participation change their investment in the project outcomes?
