# Cross-Generational Banking App Redesign: Prototyping for Diverse Users

Financial app design throws up a real challenge when you're trying to reach different demographic groups. Companies like Revolut and Monzo have found that successful interfaces need to work for both tech-savvy users and those who struggle with technology. This banking app redesign task requires you to balance competing needs: creating streamlined experiences for younger users while ensuring older demographics can navigate clearly and easily. How would you tackle this design tension while meeting specific business goals? This hands-on exploration will sharpen your prototyping skills for tackling real-world design problems.

Your challenge: overhaul a banking app to effectively serve both tech-comfortable Gen Z users and older people with varying digital confidence. This scenario reflects the complex briefs you'll handle in your professional career and gives you a chance to build up your Adobe XD prototyping toolkit.

## The Cross-Generational Banking Challenge

Picture this: FinanceFirst Bank has hired you to revamp their mobile banking app. Their business requirements include:

- Boosting mobile banking adoption among users 55+
- Keeping their growing Gen Z customer base engaged
- Cutting customer service calls about app navigation by 30%
- Creating consistent experiences across different device sizes
- Meeting WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

This project calls for a solid grasp of how different generations interact with financial technology. You'll need to resolve the tension between interfaces that feel natural to digital natives while remaining approachable to those less comfortable with technology.

**Try This when you're struggling to understand vastly different user needs:** Pick one key banking function (like checking account balance) and sketch two completely different interface approaches—one super-simplified for older users and one feature-packed for tech-savvy users. Then identify three specific elements from each that could merge into a single, adaptable interface. What design principles emerged that might guide your entire project?

## Synthesising User Research in Adobe XD

Adobe XD offers helpful tools for organizing complex user insights:

1. **Create a Research Synthesis Board in Adobe XD:**
   - Set up an artboard titled "Research Synthesis"
   - Import user interview highlights as colour-coded sticky notes (blue for Gen Z, orange for 55+)
   - Use Adobe XD's grouping feature to cluster insights by theme

2. **Develop User Personas:**
   - Create visual persona profiles for two key users:
     - **Maya (22):** Digital native who banks exclusively through mobile apps
     - **Robert (67):** Transitioning from in-branch to digital banking

3. **Create a Comparative Needs Matrix:**
   - Map different user priorities side by side:
     - Gen Z: Quick biometric logins, instant transfers, modern aesthetics
     - Older users: Clear navigation, explicit confirmation steps, larger touch targets

**Try This when user research feels overwhelming and disconnected:** Take 10 minutes to create a simple "pain point parity chart" for your two user groups. List the top three frustrations for each demographic, then draw lines connecting any that share underlying causes. For each connection, brainstorm one design solution that addresses both groups' needs. How might this approach help you find unexpected common ground in seemingly opposing requirements?

## Developing Persona-Based Wireframes

Now you'll create detailed wireframes informed by your user personas:

1. **For Maya's User Journey:**
   - Streamlined authentication with biometric options
   - Prominent P2P (person-to-person) payment features
   - Data visualisation for spending patterns
   - Minimalist visual design with bold typography

2. **For Robert's User Journey:**
   - Clear labelling and explicit navigation
   - Step-by-step transaction flows with confirmation screens
   - Prominent help features and tooltips
   - Visual confirmation for completed actions

**Key Insight:** We're not creating separate apps but identifying design patterns that can adapt to different user preferences within a single cohesive application. Think about how apps like Monzo or Starling have managed this balance.

## Setting Up a Multi-Device Design System

Your next step is to build a comprehensive design system that ensures coherence across multiple devices:

1. **Establish a Component Library:**
   - Create a practical UI kit with flexible components
   - Design adaptive navigation patterns that transform appropriately by device
   - Develop a responsive grid system for phone, tablet, and desktop views

2. **Implement a Scalable Typography System:**
   - Define a type scale that maintains readability across devices
   - Check for sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
   - Create text styles that can scale without breaking layouts

3. **Design Flexible Interactive Elements:**
   - Create components with multiple states (default, hover, active, focused)
   - Make sure touch targets exceed minimum size requirements (at least 44×44 pixels for optimal accessibility)
   - Design consistent feedback mechanisms for all interactions

**Try This when your design system feels too rigid for diverse user needs:** Select one key component (like a transaction button) and create three variations with increasing levels of guidance—from minimal for tech-savvy users to highly descriptive for beginners. Then create a single adaptive component that can transform between these states based on user preference settings. What principles could you apply to make other components similarly flexible?

## Implementing Accessibility in Your Prototype

Accessibility isn't just ticking boxes—it's crucial for creating truly inclusive financial products:

1. **Colour and Contrast:**
   - Test your colour palette for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using Adobe XD's accessibility tools
   - Create alternative themes for users with different visual needs
   - Make sure information isn't conveyed by colour alone

2. **Navigation and Structure:**
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
   - Design clear focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Create logical tab order for all interactive elements

3. **Interaction Design:**
   - Provide multiple ways to complete key tasks
   - Design clear error states with helpful recovery options
   - Include options to adjust text size and reduce motion

LEARNING JUSTIFICATION: This specific technical workflow is rarely captured in free stock photography but is essential for students to understand how accessibility testing is integrated into the design process.

**Try This when accessibility feels like it's compromising your visual design:** Choose one screen from your banking app prototype that you're particularly proud of visually. Run it through a color blindness simulator and a text-only screen reader test. Identify three specific elements that fail accessibility standards, then redesign them to be fully accessible while maintaining your aesthetic vision. How might these constraints actually improve your overall design?

Consider these questions as you approach your own prototyping work: - How could you reconcile competing user needs without creating entirely separate interfaces? - What specific components would benefit most from adaptive design based on user preferences? - What testing methods would be most effective with diverse user groups? - Which metrics would best determine if your design successfully serves both demographics? Try creating a sophisticated prototype for a single banking function (like checking an account balance) that works well for both younger and older users. Consider discussing your design decisions in our next virtual meetup. Sketch a quick list of three key principles guiding your approach. **Pro Tip:** When designing for multiple generations, consider using progressive disclosure techniques—where complex features are hidden until needed. This approach can satisfy both Maya's desire for efficiency and Robert's need for clarity without creating separate interfaces.
