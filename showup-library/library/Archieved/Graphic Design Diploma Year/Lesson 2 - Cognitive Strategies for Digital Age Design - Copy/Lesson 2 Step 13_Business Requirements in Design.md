# Business Requirements in Design

# Translating Business Objectives into Design Requirements

Good designers know how to link business goals with design solutions to create real value for clients. Picture a coffee shop wanting to boost mobile orders - a skilled designer would look at where users drop off, fix the checkout process to reduce abandonment, and add visual elements highlighting loyalty programs. For tech startups, designers need to transform complex technical details into visuals that show investors the market potential.

These examples show how design choices directly support commercial goals—this skill sets apart designers who deliver strategic work rather than just pretty pictures.

## Understanding the Business-Design Connection

Design should serve specific business purposes. Clients typically talk about outcomes they want—more sales, better brand recognition, reaching new audiences—not design specs. Your job involves interpreting these commercial goals and turning them into thoughtful design strategies.

**Professional Development:** At this point in your career, you'll need to identify the underlying business metrics driving client requests, helping you suggest more effective design solutions with measurable results.

**Try This when a client's brief focuses only on aesthetics but lacks business goals**: Set up a quick 15-minute call specifically to ask about their business challenges and what success looks like to them in concrete terms. Write down what they say and connect each design element back to these goals. How might this change your approach compared to working from a purely visual brief?

## Strategic Design Brief Development

Your approach to design briefs now needs to include more nuanced methods that directly connect business strategy to design decisions:

1. **Strategic Project Framing**: Placing the design challenge within the client's broader business context
   - Looking at market position and competitive landscape
   - Finding business growth opportunities the design could address

2. **Business Objectives**: Outlining measurable commercial goals
   - Specific KPIs the design should impact
   - Fitting with the client's long-term business plans

3. **Audience Insight Analysis**: Going beyond basic demographics to deeper understanding
   - Behavior patterns and decision-making factors
   - Mapping customer journeys and key touchpoints

4. **Strategic Messaging Framework**: Creating a complete communication strategy
   - Message hierarchy that aligns with business priorities
   - Content strategy supporting conversion goals

5. **Strategic Design Requirements**: Developing specifications that directly support business objectives
   - Design elements clearly linked to business outcomes
   - Technical and functional needs with business justifications

6. **Performance Measurement Plan**: Setting up ways to evaluate business impact
   - Tools for tracking design effectiveness
   - Testing methods to improve performance

7. **Implementation Roadmap**: Developing a strategic rollout plan
   - Phased deployment based on business priorities
   - Integration with broader marketing and business initiatives

**Try This when you're struggling to connect visual decisions to business outcomes**: Pick a recent project and identify three specific design choices you made. For each choice, note what business metric it might affect (e.g., conversion rate, time on page, brand recall). What evidence could you gather to prove your design decisions worked beyond just looking good?

## Business Requirement Analysis: Strategic Applications

Let's look at how thorough business requirement analysis works across different scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Promotional Campaign for Product Launch

**Business Objective**: Boost awareness and drive initial sales of a new eco-friendly water bottle, aiming for 10,000 units sold in the first quarter.

**Strategic Design Requirements**:
- Create a visual hierarchy highlighting the product's sustainable materials and three key features based on research into what drives consumer purchases
- Build a visual system with modular components that stay on-brand while optimizing for different digital platforms' engagement metrics
- Use colors that stand out 40% more than competitors in stores while reinforcing brand positioning
- Design call-to-action elements with A/B testing to maximize click-through rates
- Craft promotional messages balancing urgency with value to drive immediate purchases
- Use QR codes with tracking capabilities to monitor engagement from offline to online touchpoints
- Set production specifications that meet both sustainability goals and cost limits

### Scenario 2: Rebranding a Local Bakery

**Business Objective**: Reposition a family-owned bakery to attract health-conscious millennials while keeping loyal customers, hoping to increase foot traffic by 25%.

**Strategic Design Requirements**:
- Develop a brand identity that appeals to both demographic groups, verified through targeted testing
- Choose a color palette based on food retail consumer psychology research
- Design packaging that highlights organic ingredients for new customers while keeping heritage cues for existing ones
- Create store design elements that improve visibility and enhance the customer journey
- Select typography that balances current trends with readability for various age groups
- Develop a social media visual approach with engagement targets for each content type
- Create visual merchandising that increases average purchase value through strategic product highlighting

**Try This when a client says they want a rebrand but can't articulate why**: Make a simple one-page questionnaire with just 5 questions about business challenges rather than design preferences. Include: "What's holding back growth right now?" and "What do competitors do better?" Use their answers to identify 2-3 concrete business goals that design could address. How does this shift your approach to the rebrand conversation?
