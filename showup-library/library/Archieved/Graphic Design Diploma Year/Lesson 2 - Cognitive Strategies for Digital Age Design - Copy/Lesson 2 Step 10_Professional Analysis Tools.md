# Problem-Framing Tools for Design Practice

This section explores mind mapping and SWOT analysis—two visualization methods regularly used by design studios like Pentagram and IDEO. These techniques transform abstract design challenges into structured, actionable plans by organizing complex information visually. Top agencies rely on these methods when working on projects ranging from brand identity systems to multi-platform user experiences, helping designers spot connections and priorities that linear documentation typically misses.

## Mind Mapping for Design Problem Visualisation

Mind mapping is a fantastic thinking technique that lets you visualise complex connections between ideas, uncovering patterns and insights that might stay hidden when using more linear approaches to ideation.

### How Mind Maps Work in Design

Mind maps reflect how our brains naturally connect information across multiple levels. As your design career develops, this technique enables you to document the full ecosystem of a design problem—from audience needs to technical constraints—in a single strategic visual document.

**Try This when you're overwhelmed by a complex design brief**: Grab a blank sheet of paper and sketch your main design challenge in the middle. Create 5-7 main branches for key considerations (audience, constraints, goals, etc.), then add specific details to each branch. Look for unexpected connections between branches and circle the three most promising insights. How might these connections inspire a unique design approach?

### Step-by-Step Mind Mapping Guide

1. **Start with the central problem**
   * Draw your main design challenge in the middle of your page
   * Example: "Design interactive museum exhibition guide"

2. **Branch out with primary categories**
   * Create main branches for key considerations
   * Example branches: Visitor Experience, Technology Options, Content Structure, Accessibility, Budget

3. **Develop secondary branches**
   * Add specific details to each primary branch
   * For "Visitor Experience": First-time vs. Returning, Age Groups, Knowledge Levels, Time Constraints

4. **Make connections**
   * Draw lines between related elements across branches
   * Use colours to highlight patterns or priorities

5. **Review and refine**
   * Look for clusters of ideas that suggest strategic design directions
   * Identify gaps requiring further research

### Design Example: Sustainable Fashion App

Imagine a project to design an app for a sustainable fashion startup. Your mind map might reveal meaningful connections between:
- The brand's commitment to transparency (under Brand Values)
- Users wanting to verify ethical sourcing claims (under User Needs)
- Technical capabilities for QR code scanning of garment tags (under Technology)

This connection points to a design direction that incorporates a product verification feature, which would shape your UI design, information architecture, and visual storytelling—creating a thorough strategic approach that tackles both business goals and user needs.

**Try This when you're stuck in the initial concept phase of a project**: Pick a real or hypothetical design project and create a mind map focusing specifically on user pain points and potential solutions. After finishing your map, highlight the three most surprising connections you discovered. Snap a photo of your mind map to reference during your next client meeting. What unexpected insight might shift your approach to the project?

## SWOT Analysis for Design Projects

SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) helps evaluate the internal and external factors affecting your design project, offering a strategic foundation for decision-making that extends your evaluative skills into professional territory.

### How SWOT Analysis Benefits Designers

SWOT analysis helps designers identify competitive advantages, recognize limitations, spot market opportunities, and prepare for potential obstacles—all crucial for creating effective design solutions that address complex client needs in competitive markets.

**Try This when preparing for a client pitch or project proposal**: Do a quick SWOT analysis for your design concept using the template below. Pay special attention to the "Threats" quadrant—identify three specific market or implementation challenges your design might face. For each threat, note one way your design could address or mitigate it. How might highlighting these proactive solutions strengthen your client presentation?

│ STRENGTHS           │ WEAKNESSES          │
│ (Internal Positive) │ (Internal Negative) │
│                     │                     │
│                     │                     │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ OPPORTUNITIES       │ THREATS             │
│ (External Positive) │ (External Negative) │
│                     │                     │

### Applying SWOT to a Design Project

**Example: Healthcare App Redesign**

* **Strengths**: 
  - Access to detailed user research data
  - Strong existing brand recognition in healthcare sector
  - Specialized knowledge of medical terminology and workflows

* **Weaknesses**: 
  - Limited experience with accessibility requirements
  - Tight development timeline due to regulatory deadlines
  - Complex information architecture needs simplification

* **Opportunities**: 
  - Growing market of health-conscious users
  - Integration with wearable technology
  - Potential partnerships with healthcare providers

* **Threats**: 
  - Strict healthcare data privacy regulations
  - Established competitors with larger development teams
  - Rapidly evolving technology standards

## Connecting Your Learning

You now have several complementary approaches in your professional toolkit: The 5 Whys technique helps you drill down to root causes, mind mapping expands your thinking laterally, and SWOT analysis evaluates contextual factors. Together, these methods give you a solid framework for problem framing that will set your work apart in industry settings and client presentations.

**Try This when starting a new client project**: Choose a current design project you're working on and create a mind map to visualise all aspects of the problem. Using insights from your mind map, complete a SWOT analysis for the project. Identify at least three strategic design directions that emerged from these exercises that you hadn't previously considered. Share your findings with classmates through the discussion forum—seeing how others approach these professional tools can provide valuable perspective for your own practice. Take a photo of your favorite insight to reference later.
