Psychology in Design
Psychology is very important in design as design is an act of communication.

Interaction Design Principles
Users interact with websites and other digital products, which has led to the formation of several essential principles related to interaction design.

Consistency
The importance of maintaining strict consistency varies by level:
Top level consistency
Platform consistency (defacto standards)
In-house consistency (maintain a general look & feel across your products/services)
Consistency across a suite of products (e.g. Adobe).
The overall look & feel of a single app, application or service: splash screens, design elements, etc. (A visual designer should establish a purposeful & well thought-through visual language.)
Small visible structures, such as icons, symbols, buttons, scroll bars, etc. Interpretation of user behaviour (shortcut keys, back button etc.)

Learnability
Ideally, products would have no learning curve: Users would walk up to them for the very first time and achieve instant mastery.
In practice, however, all applications and services, no matter how simple, will display a learning curve.
Learnability and usability are not mutually exclusive. First, decide which is the most important; then attack both with vigor.

Readability
Text that must be read should have high contrast.
Use font sizes that are large enough to be readable on standard displays.
Favour particularly large characters for the actual data you intend to display, as opposed to labels and instructions.
Menu and button labels should have the key word(s) first, forming unique labels.
Test all designs on your oldest expected user population.
There’s often an inverse relationship between the “prettiness” of a font and its readability.

Efficiency of the User
Look at the user’s productivity, not the computer’s.
Keep the user occupied.
Error messages should actually help
Explain what’s wrong
Tell the user specifically what to do about it
Leave open the possibility the message is improperly being generated by a deeper system malfunction.

Colour
Colour Blindness
Any time colour is used to convey information in the interface, use clear, secondary cues to convey information to those who cannot see the colours presented.
Test your site to see what color-blind individuals see.
Search Google for simulation tools.
For websites, you might try http://enably.com/chrometric/.
For images, http://www.colblindor.com/coblis-color-blindness- simulator/.
Colour as a vital interface element
Do not avoid colour in the interface just because not every user can see every colour.

Hick’s Law
To avoid overwhelming users with too many choices and keep them engaged, Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is recommended.
Hick’s Law, named after psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, states that the more choices a person is presented with, the longer the person will take to reach a decision.

Fitt’s Law
Fitts’s Law, developed in 1954 by psychologist Paul Fitts, states that it is quicker to hit a target that is larger and closer in proximity to you. It also states that fast movements directed towards smaller targets result in greater error rates.
Fitts backed his statement up with an equation, examining ease dependant on variables.

Design Patterns
A number of reusable solutions have been developed to aid UI designers with commonly occurring issues. These are known as design patterns. To use a design pattern, it is essential to first summarise the problem and then investigate how others have solved this problem before adapting it to one’s own needs.

UI Design Patterns
UI design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems.
They are not a finished design and cannot simply be coded. They are considered best practice, working as guide or templates, available to designers and developers as a means of solving common problems when designing mobile applications or similar systems.

When to Use Design Patterns
Social sharing: facilitating the promotion and sharing of content via social media platforms.
Navigation: guides users around an interface and ensures they find their way back to the homepage easily.
Input/output: allow users submit information and receive feedback from the site based on their actions.
Content structuring: how the site is organised to feel intuitive and accessible.

But, simply put, you use them once you understand the problem for which they are required.

You can also download UI kits for Material Design or iOS directly through your prototyping software.

Difference between IOS & Android
There are many similarities between iOS and Android’s Material Design, in language and philosophy. There are also differences and these can impact design decisions.
So, it is important to decide the platform the design is intended for early in the design process.

Creating Prototypes
Low fidelity prototypes precede high fidelity. These can be created as paper prototypes (as per last week’s class) or you can create an interactive low fidelity version (or both!).
An interactive low fidelity prototype is a good way to begin getting to grips with the prototyping software and makes it easier to progress to creating the high fidelity version.
