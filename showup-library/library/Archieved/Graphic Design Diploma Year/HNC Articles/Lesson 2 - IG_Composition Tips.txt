Composition Tips
Your choice of composition will be informed mainly by your concept – do you want shock and impact, or subtlety and depth? Additionally, here are some other considerations when it comes to crafting your compositions.
Focal Point
Does your design have a focal point and a sense of hierarchy? Where do you wish the viewers eye to be drawn to first?
The Rule of Thirds
One of the most effective principles in grid design is called the Rule of Thirds, also known as the golden grid rule. The Rule of Thirds is a technique which is applied by dividing a space into thirds, both vertically and horizontally, creating a grid of 9 parts.
With this grid in mind the rule of thirds now identifies four important parts of the layout that you should consider placing points of interest in as you compose your design.
The Golden Ratio
The Golden Section, Golden Ratio, Divine Proportion and Fibonacci Sequence are all names for the same thing; A ratio of 1.618. Found in art, architecture, design, and most intriguingly, in nature, this ratio has been used throughout history and today for its aesthetic beauty. The Golden Ratio is a ratio, which is evident throughout the universe as the number Phi. (Not Pi which is another naturally occurring ratio of 3.14).
You can use this ratio to good effect in design by making sure that elements of your grid and or your layout conform to this ratio. Using the Golden Section can ensure a natural sense of correct composition, even though it is based in mathematics it will ‘feel’ right.”
