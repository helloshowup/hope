Who becomes a designer?
Designers are keen observers. They pay attention as they move through their day, possessing a hyper awareness of the visual and textual world around them.
They make connections and ask questions about how those objects and messages work, what they are, what things look like, and what they mean.

Artists and designers of all kinds are fundamentally interested in the world around them and they take inspiration from the most mundane of things.
As a designer you must broaden your horizons in order to be able to successfully communicate with all kinds of people from all age groups, professions and backgrounds.

Getting a sense of the rich varied world around us can be truly inspirational.
Simply by trying new things you can open your mind up to a whole other world of possibilities - so read a different newspaper today / take the train instead of the bus / cook a new dish for dinner and listen to a new genre of music you’ve never heard before.

Recording Devices
As exciting as it might be to try new things all the time, the trick is to do it ‘critically’ if possible. Try to be aware of what the new experience is showing you. It’s also impossible to remember experiences as time passes so having some form of recording device to hand is useful - this may be a camera, a sketch book, a phone … whichever is most relevant to your area of interest.

If something grabs your attention, draw it, note it down, photograph it or file it away immediately! Not only will your drawing and research skills improve but over time you will build yourself a “catalogue of inspiration’ that you can draw upon at any time in your career - especially when you are short on ideas!

Use your notebooks as a Visual Diary/scrapbook
It is also a great idea to keep things that interest you: love for old packaging, club flyers, business cards save them up and create scrapbooks full of them - you never know when these might inspire or aid in a project or brief.
