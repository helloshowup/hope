HOW TO CITE AND REFERENCE IMAGES
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER – THE MAIN BODY OF YOUR WORK
The theme ‘Nature and Industry’ calls to mind the existence of opposite viewpoints in our landscape. For example, some might look at images of scorched earth and blue skies and see nature’s losing battle with human industry. Others might look at the same image and see only the beauty of a natural landscape – one that existed before and beyond modern urban life.
These opposites can be evoked by experimenting with composition, light and shadow or by challenging expectations in design. Such contrasts can create interesting visual results. For example, see the way Simone Rocha pairs delicately embroidered fabrics with wellington style boots

All About Hue: Understanding the Importance of Color in Design
by
A. Student
For designers in a wide range of industries, knowing how to choose a color palette that keeps up with trends and expresses a specific mood, is a core part of their toolkit. Being able to predict which colors will be popular season after season is a sign of a true professional.
argues for the importance of forecasting colors. In her article discussing how colors are forecasted she writes that ‘picking the hues which are going to be key two years ahead of season contributes massively to the overall product design process’

HARVARD CITING AND REFERENCING
REFERENCING TIPS
If you can’t find the name of the creator/author of a work you want to reference:
Use the publisher’s name (e.g. ‘Vogue’, ‘Architectural Digest’)
If you cannot find a date of publication:
Use (n.d.) - meaning ‘no date’
If you are in doubt about your reference ask the following question:
If I only had this information, could I find the source of the image/quote/idea?
Collect and keep a record of information you will need to cite and reference every time you find a piece of work you would like to use in your assignments. It is much harder to go back later and search for the information at the end of your project.
