Digital File Management
Finalising a particular design concept is not the end of the road for a graphic design project. The formatting, safekeeping, and sharing of those files are critical next steps to ensure effective project flow right up to the conclusion of the project. This is where digital file management comes in.

Digital file management is the process of organising, storing, and retrieving digital files efficiently and securely. It is important for designers to practise effective file management to ensure that files are organised in a logical manner, easily accessible, and protected from loss or unauthorised access. These steps are particularly helpful when you are working as part of a team and when you need to share your digital designs with those involved in the production phase (e.g. printers).
Document set up 
When setting up documents for graphic design projects, there are several points of consideration that are essential to ensuring optimal results. 
Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI) in an image. To ensure high-quality output, the standard resolution is typically 300 DPI for print designs. For digital design, a resolution of 72 DPI is standard in web and screen-based graphics. Higher resolutions may be required for large-format printing or projects requiring very detailed images.
Colour mode
Colour mode determines how colours are represented in a particular document. For print design, the standard colour mode is CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), which is used for 4-colour process printing. For digital design and web graphics, the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colour mode is standard. It's important for a designer to set the colour mode correctly to ensure accurate colour reproduction and consistency across different devices.
Document size and bleed
Whether it's print or digital, it is important to always set the document size to the dimensions required for the final output. For print projects, include a bleed area beyond the trim edge to accommodate for any trimming variations during the finishing process. The bleed area should typically be around 0.125 inches (0.3 cm) to ensure that background colours and/or images extend to the edge of the finished design.
Margins and safe area
Leave sufficient margins and a safe area within the document to ensure that important content such as text and logos are not cut off during printing or cropping. It's recommended that you keep critical elements at least 0.25 (0.6 cm) to 0.5 inches (1.2 cm) away from the trim edge to avoid unwanted trimming.
Import and export settings
When importing images or graphics into a document, you need to ensure that they are of sufficient resolution and quality for the intended output. Prior to importing them into a design file, you will need to use image editing software to adjust and optimise as needed. When exporting the final document, use settings appropriate for the intended use, such as compression settings for digital graphics or PDF settings for print files.
File formats
You will need to save your work in the correct format for its intended use. Not only will you need to consider its colour mode (RGB/CMYK) but you will also need to save the file with the appropriate layers and transparency. The correct file format will be selected based on the project requirements and intended use. Common file formats for print design include PDF (Portable Document Format), AI (Adobe Illustrator), and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript). For digital designs and web graphics, formats such as JPEG, PNG, and SVG are commonly used.
Digital file formats – what to use? 
PNG
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files are a popular raster graphics format commonly used for digital graphics and web design. There are several benefits to using PNG files. For one, they use lossless compression, meaning they retain all the original image data without sacrificing quality. JPEG files on the other hand, use lossy compression and may result in some loss of image detail. PNG files maintain high-quality images and because PNG files are losslessly compressed, they are also suitable for editing and re-saving multiple times without degradation of image quality. 
Another upside to PNG files is that they support alpha channel transparency, allowing for images with transparent backgrounds or partial transparency. You can therefore use PNG files for graphics such as logos, icons, and overlays that need to be placed on different backgrounds without a visible border. In terms of colour quality, PNG files support both indexed colour and true colour images. Indexed colour PNGs use a palette of up to 256 colours, while true colour PNGs can display millions of colours.

Finally, PNG files are compatible with a wide range of graphic design and image editing software, including Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Adobe Illustrator, and many others. They are also supported by most operating systems and web browsers. Overall, PNG files offer excellent quality and transparency support and they tend to have larger file sizes compared to other formats like JPEG. It is therefore important that you remember to optimise PNG images for web use to ensure faster loading times and better user experience.
JPEG
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group and is ‘the standard’ when you are working with image files. While there are many ways to store and save images, with other popular formats including TIFF and Bitmap, the JPEG has become the most used format across the world. If you are viewing an image on the internet, on your computer or even in hardcopy print in a newspaper or magazine, it was probably created from a JPEG.

JPEG has the advantage that it is compressible so the file size can be reduced for online use or easy storage. This is appropriate for most graphic designers but if you are capturing and editing your own photographs, JPEG has a number of issues. JPEG is a compressed format and image quality diminishes every time you edit the photo. This is known as destructive editing, as every time you edit and save the photo, it recompresses the file and the quality fractionally diminishes. Also bear in mind that even when used in a high quality setting the JPEG records considerably less image data than the RAW format for example. This is done to reduce file size for storage efficiency and easy transmission across the internet.  
JPEG photos also have a smaller dynamic range making it less capable of correcting or amending exposure. Even with high quality, you will begin to see some compression which manifests itself as a pixilation or ‘blockiness’ in the image.
RAW
RAW is a format which records the highest level of detail from your image sensor in your camera. It is often referred to as the ‘digital negative’ as it is directly outputted from the sensor. RAW files have two drawbacks in that they tend to be large in file size and they need digital editing before they can be converted into usable formats such as JPEG.

The major advantages of RAW outweigh its drawbacks and all serious photographers will use the RAW file format. The main advantages of the RAW format are threefold:  
Because the file format retains all of the image data from your digital sensor, greater image detail and dynamic range is retained.  RAW format allows you to adjust image exposure much more successfully than in JPEG format.  
As the file format retains all of the colour data captured by the sensor, you can easily adjust the colour balance in post processing. This is invaluable when your camera gets the white balance wrong!  
As it is a lossless file format, as you edit and adjust the file in post processing, you don’t lose any image quality and you can amend and change the exposure  and colour balance settings at any stage.  
In short, if you are going to take photography seriously, shoot in RAW!
Advice for downloading files
When downloading files for graphic design, whether they are stock photos, fonts, design assets, or software, it's essential to follow certain best practices. This will ensure you employ only high-quality resources while also protecting your computer and respecting copyright laws.

Tips for effectively downloading, storing and managing design files:
Only download files using trusted/reputable websites and sources known for providing content that is both legal and of a high-quality. 
Before downloading any files, carefully review the licensing terms and usage rights associated with the content.  
After downloading files, verify the integrity of your downloaded content to ensure they haven't been corrupted or altered in any way. 
When downloading design assets or resources, keep track of the original sources and licensing information for future reference. 
Maintain a well-organised folder of downloaded files to keep track of different types of resources. 
Regularly backup downloaded files to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure or accidental deletion. Use external hard drives, cloud storage services, or dedicated backup solutions to create redundant copies of important design resources.
Ensure that your graphic design software is up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. 
When downloading large files or multiple resources, consider using file compression formats like ZIP or RAR to reduce download times and save disk space. Make sure to scan compressed files for viruses before extracting them.
Folders, indexing, and folder naming conventions 
Now that you have created and downloaded your design files, you need to be very logical about how you save your designs. Carefully consider a file naming and management system that ensures you know where your photos, templates, designs, mock-ups etc. are, and how to quickly find and access them. To achieve this, you need to have a logical route for storing your files in an organised fashion, ensuring that you clearly label each folder and file within it. For example you could create a primary folder for each year, then a subfolder for each project possibly categorised into different stages of the design process according to dates. If working commercially, you could organise master folders for each client, with individual designs sitting below in each subfolder. You could also structure your system using dates while indexing a particular reference number or client name on each folder.

If the software you are using allows it, you should always keep previous iterations of designs. You can save work using different layers and you can use artboards to document your workflow. When it comes to labelling working versions of your designs, it is best to reference it using date stamps. Also, as a rule of thumb, your file and folder names should not contain any spaces, only underscores. The key is to keep consistency across your file systems. It is always worth spending a bit of time at the beginning of a project to work out a system that makes sense, and then stick to it.
