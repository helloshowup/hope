COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS
Select one artist, movement or style
From the History of Design lecture in Week 1 select one artist, movement or style that you have learned about. Identify any contemporary/modern practitioners who perhaps may have used this style as inspiration.
Create an A2 Comparative Analysis
Do a comparative analysis of one piece of work from each practitioner (past & present). Ask yourself is this artist / work / style relevant today?
Create 1 x A2 Board for presentation in class. For example perhaps you see a connection between El Lissitzky’s Red Wedge and the Kraftwerk album shown above.
Ensure your board is mounted neatly.

Write a Design Rationale
Write approx. 500 words critically analysing the work of your chosen historic design practitioner. You can use notes and feedback from your presentation. Pay specific attention to the communication techniques that your chosen practitioner employs and the context to which the work is situated. Ask yourself, what have you learned from this study – and can you attempt any of the techniques on display?
