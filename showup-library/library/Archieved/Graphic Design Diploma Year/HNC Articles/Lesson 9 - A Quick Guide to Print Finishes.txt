What are print finishes?
When you send off artwork to a professional printer, the process might not only involve printing your design. After the print job is finished, you might also want to add special effects to your printed product, such as bringing in metallic finishes or cutting your document to give it unusual edges. The printer will be able to create most of these print finishes (also known as post-print effects) in- house, or in some cases, can send your printed items off to a print finishes specialist.
Either way, it’s a great idea to wise up on the post-print effects you can ask for and what they might be suitable for. You’ll end up with a beautiful final print product…and a very happy printer!
Start off on the right foot...
The basis (literally) for any good printed design is what it’s printed on. For single-sheet print jobs, like business cards or posters, use a heavier stock to add some weight and sturdiness; for multi-sheet jobs like books or pamphlets, use a lighter stock. Once you’ve figured out your substrate, you can turn your attention to print finishes.

QUICK GUIDE
Varnishes
Varnishes are applied to paper for the same reason they’re applied to wood – to give it a smooth, consistent texture and protect your design. Varnishes seal your printed material and they can be added to your entire page without adding much weight, which is why many high-quality books and magazines will use varnished pages.
Spot UV varnishes add interesting texture and visual appeal, and they’re a great way to add dimension or flow to your design without compromising its message. Varnishing also adds an extra tactile dimension to packaging designs, being particularly suited to items which will be held once picked off the shelves.
Lamination
Similar to varnish, lamination involves applying a protective layer of coating. However, laminate coating is usually made of some type of plastic, so it adds strength to your printed design and can also make it water resistant.
Because lamination adds a more substantial coating to your design, it results in a heavier print that adds to its tactile feel. For this reason,
it’s often used for business cards or books with soft covers. Lamination can be gloss or matte as shown in the examples here.
Foiling
Foiling refers to the application of metallic or pigmented material using either heat or pressure. It’s a luxurious printing finish, and it goes a long way to adding visual interest and texture to your printed design.
Foiling is often used for logos, but it can also be used for text. Make sure to talk to your printer about the best method for stamping, and be prepared to include a vector image of what you want foil stamped.
Embossing
Embossing and dembossing are similar processes that create a different result. Both processes involve making a metal plate and a counter. The plate is mounted on a press and the paper is stamped
between the plate and counter. This force of pressure pushes the stock into the plate, creating the impression.
Embossing produces a raised impression on your paper stock, while debossing creates a depressed impression.
Die-cutting
Die cutting involves physically cutting shapes into your paper design. Die cutting normally involves creating
a custom piece (known as a “die”), but your printer might have some standard pieces available for you to choose from. Dies can also be used to score or perforate your designs. letters, or use a larger font or typeface.
