Characteristics of Outcomes in Relation To A Brief
Constantly reviewing your ideas is a vital exercise in the iterative design process. Reviews will help you ascertain whether or not your designs solve the design problem or brief and to gauge how well the design works. You don’t necessarily seek to implement anything new at this stage; it’s simply about evaluating and refining your designs to see if it effectively answers the brief. This is ideally done before, for example, transferring your sketched designs to CAD, or sending your digital files for production. 
Assessing your designs involves evaluating various elements such as aesthetics, functionality, creativity, and effectiveness in conveying the intended message. Some designers have a checklist to remind them of these critical review points, others have teams to provide feedback. Regardless of how you intend to evaluate your ideas, here are some important aspects to consider:
Objectives
Your design outcomes for a project should directly address the requirements outlined in the graphic design brief. This includes adhering to specifications such as target audience, tone, messaging, and any technical specifications provided.

Firstly, an effective graphic design will clearly communicate the message. In order to do this, the design should convey the intended message or information in a way that is easy to understand as well as visually appealing. When reviewing your designs, ask yourself (or others in the case of feedback) whether the message is clear and easy to understand.
Next, you will need to determine whether the design aligns with the project brief and objectives. Does it meet all requirements and the client’s expectations? For example, if one of the key objectives in the brief was to target a specific audience, does your design resonate with the intended audience? Does it capture their attention and keep them engaged? Another objective might be related to the intended format or platform on which your designs will appear (e.g. print, digital, or multimedia). You would therefore need to consider whether you have tailored your designs to the intended medium of presentation and/or distribution. Is it adaptable and functional in different contexts? If the design involves interactive elements or user interfaces, functionality and usability are crucial. Design outcomes should be intuitive to use, with clear navigation and accessible features where applicable.
Aesthetics
Functionality and aesthetics go hand-in-hand in graphic design. A graphic designer simply cannot sacrifice one for the other and expect an effective outcome. Your designs need to demonstrate creativity, originality, and be engaging to the intended audience. A well-executed design also demonstrates attention to detail, from precise alignment and spacing to careful selection of colours and typography. The smallest details can make all the difference when it comes to professionalism and the overall impact of the design.
When assessing visual appeal, consider the overall attractiveness of the design. Does it grab attention and create a positive impression? Generally, as a designer, you would hone in on specific elements and principles of the design to either establish its appeal or to refine it if there is room for improvement. For instance, you may assess the design’s visual hierarchy and ensure it is guiding the viewer's eye in the intended manner. You may also examine the organisation of the design. In evaluating the organisation, which includes layout, use of space, and balance, consider whether the composition is visually pleasing and easy to navigate. These are two of the most visually impactful aspects to consider in your design.

The organisation of elements also includes typography. You will need to assess the readability and appropriateness of the chosen fonts by asking yourself whether they complement the overall design and message. Another critical element to assess is colour and imagery. Consider the choice of colours and their harmony. Do the colours enhance the design or detract from it? Does your chosen colour scheme, along with imagery, evoke emotional responses and engage the audience? 
Technical
When it comes to reviewing the technical aspects of your design, you will need to consider things like the resolution and quality of your images, file formats, and file sizes. Begin by checking the resolution and quality of images and graphics used. Are they clear and of high-resolution? Then, ensure the design is saved in appropriate file formats for its intended use and consider whether it is optimised for web or print (according to the directive of the design brief). In relation to file size, especially for digital platforms, consider and assess whether it is optimised for fast loading without sacrificing quality. Quality design outcomes should also be flexible enough to adapt to different contexts or scale as needed. This may involve providing variations for different sizes or formats, ensuring the design remains effective across various applications.

Version control
Version control in graphic design refers to the management of changes made to design files over time, allowing designers to track revisions, collaborate efficiently, and maintain consistency throughout the design process. While version control systems are commonly associated with software development, they can also be adapted for graphic design workflows.
To support this, you should utilise version control software specifically designed for graphic design files. Some software options include Adobe Creative Cloud Libraries, Abstract, Plant, or Kactus. These tools allow designers to manage versions, track changes, and collaborate seamlessly through timestamps and comments within design files. File naming conventions should also be applied that include version numbers, dates, or descriptive labels to differentiate between iterations. For example, "ProjectName_v1," "ProjectName_v2," etc.

It is also best to regularly back up design files and maintain a version history to protect against data loss or accidental changes. Version control systems typically offer backup and recovery features, allowing designers to revert to previous versions if needed. Finally, your design files and practices should include ‘managing permissions’ and ‘access control settings’ within version control software to restrict access to sensitive design files and to limit editing privileges based on roles and responsibilities.
Testing and inspection
The objective of testing your design outcomes is to find out whether or not the design/prototype solves the design problem or brief and to gauge how well it works, i.e. to measure the design's effectiveness in achieving its intended goals. When evaluating your designs to ensure high quality outcomes, you don’t want to implement anything new; it’s simply about rolling out or presenting your design to see if it effectively answers the brief. 
For example, if you designed a new website, you would trial it with a user who will navigate the site and provide you with feedback on their experience. This helps you to objectively understand your design choices through feedback, findings, and insights. If applicable, you can track performance metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, or engagement metrics to assess the design's impact. Depending on the design, other ways to ascertain performance is through feedback, either through a public survey or presentation to the following: 
a client
colleagues/team members
other creative practitioners
a focus group

After analysing the results, you can make a final conclusion about the effectiveness of the design. A final conclusion typically falls into one of the following categories:
The design is suitable, effective, and addresses the brief (i.e. ready for implementation) 
The design can be improved (i.e. needs minor adjustments to mock-up)
The design does not satisfy the brief or solve the design problem (i.e. requires further or more extensive ideation)
If it’s the latter, you will then need to revisit the ideation stage and decide if the problem lies with the initial idea or if you should have refined the idea differently at a later stage of the process? 
Documentation
Documentation plays a crucial role in quality assurance in graphic design. It provides a framework for consistency, accountability, and communication throughout the design process.

The following documentation will typically contribute to quality assurance in graphic design:
Project Briefs
Detailed project briefs document the project's objectives, scope, target audience, deadlines, and deliverables. They serve as a reference point for designers, ensuring alignment with client expectations and project goals. Project briefs also outline technical requirements such as dimensions, file formats, resolution, and colour profiles to help designers produce designs that meet printing or digital display standards and ensure compatibility across platforms.
Style guides & brand guidelines
Style guides and brand guidelines are a critical part of your design documentation. They outline essential elements such as brand colours, typography, imagery, and logo usage. These guidelines will provide you with a set of rules and standards to follow, ensuring consistency in the design across different assets and channels. 
Feedback and revisions
Ideally, you should always document feedback from clients, stakeholders, and team members to ensure that all comments, suggestions, and revisions are accurately captured. As a designer, you can systematically refer to this documentation to address feedback, and track changes throughout the design process.
Version control
Documenting version history and revisions allows you to track changes made to design files over time. Version control systems record each iteration of the design, providing a timeline of modifications and enabling designers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Design decisions and rationale
Documenting design decisions and rationale provides insights into the creative process and justifies design choices. This documentation helps maintain transparency and facilitates communication among team members and stakeholders during the presentation of your designs.
Legal and compliance documentation
Documenting legal and compliance requirements ensures that designs adhere to copyright laws, licensing agreements, accessibility standards, and industry regulations. It is thus crucial to helping you to mitigate legal risks and ensures that design outcomes meet ethical and professional standards.
Project management documentation
Documentation related to project management, such as timelines, milestones, budgets, and resource allocations, helps track progress and manage workflows efficiently. It ensures that projects are delivered on time and within budget constraints.
