Principles of Effective Web Design
Excerpt from
http://shortiedesigns.com/2014/03/10-top-principles-effective-web-design/
Usability and the utility, not the visual design, determine the success or failure of a web-site.
According to Krug’s first law of usability, the web-page should be obvious and self-explanatory. When you’re creating a site, your job is to get rid of the question marks.
Users appreciate quality and credibility.
Content is more important than the design which supports it.
Users don’t read, they scan.
Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification.
Users follow their intuition.
Users usually just guess.
Users want to have control.

PURPOSE
Good web design always caters to the needs of the user. Are your web visitors looking for information, entertainment, some type of interaction, or to transact with your business? Each page of your website needs to have a clear purpose, and to fulfill a specific need for your website users in the most effective way possible.
Have a clear call to action

COMMUNICATION
People on the web tend to want information quickly, so it is important to communicate clearly, and make your information easy to read and digest. Some effective tactics to include in your web design include: organising information using headlines and subheadlines, using bullet points instead of long windy sentences, and cutting  the waffle.
Forms
In every project when you are going to offer your visitors some service or tool, try to keep your user requirements minimal. Forms should only ask the necessary.
Information should be grouped.
Effective writing
Use short and concise phrases (come to the point as quickly as possible)
Use scannable layout (categorize the content, use multiple heading levels
Use visual elements and bulleted lists which break the flow of uniform text blocks) use plain and objective language

TYPEFACES
In general, Sans Serif fonts such as Arial and Verdana are easier to read online (Sans Serif fonts are contemporary looking fonts without decorative finishes).
The ideal font size for reading easily online is 16px and stick to a maximum of 3 typefaces in a maximum of 3 point sizes to keep your design streamlined.
Serif fonts or a combination of fonts can increase the aesthetic appeal of your site. Also they are becoming more legible because screen resolutions are improving.
Fonts should be considered when designing a concept. Usually you wouldn’t use more than 3 types of fonts.

Did World War III Start on the Precise Day of the ECM?
Sunday, Octobef 4th, 2015 / WorldEvents / Share
Martin Armstrong on his biog about 2015.75 and one particular political decision: "Russia began bombing CIA-trained rebels in Syria precisely on the day of the turn in the Economic Confidence Model. As CNN pointed out, the bombing continues. Now, hundreds of Iranian troops have arrived in Syria to join a major ground offensive in support of President Bashar al-Assad's government.
Clearly, the civil war in Sy1ia is escalating. We will see this unfold as a proxy war directly between U.S. and Russia with China supporting the Russian side in this game. This conflict is turning regional and global in scope by drawing in the world powers all because the U.S. war machine thinks this is a game. [...] TI1is should be of great concern because historically, whatever unfolds on tl1e precise day of the ECM, becomes an important event." Read the whole article on Martin Armstrongs Biog.
Is Martin Armstrong's Debt Crisis Upon Us?
Friday, October 2nd, 2015 / Martin Armstrong's F.. / Share
Michael McKenna checks on Martin Armstrongs 2015.75 prediction for tradingfloor.com: "It is in this sense that finance belongs to tl1e most antique class ofhun1an activities, and it would follow, then, that analysts whose data stores and models extend fmthest into the past might have an advantage in extracting future events from past beha,iours and the patterns tl1at have contained them.
"You can always find someone who is calling for a crisis around the corner", says Saxo Bank bond trader Michael Boye; [...]. More specifically, howe,·er, Boye does state tl1at he agrees in principle witl1 Anustrong's debt crisis thesis. "What we have done since the financial crisis", he says, "is move all the debt problems from the balance sheets of individuals, banks, and corporations onto governments on the fiscal side, while massive central bank liquidity injections have kept the system afloat in the monetary side".

COLOURS
A well thought out colour palette can go a long way to enhance the user experience. Complementary colours create balance and harmony. Using contrasting colours for the text and background will make reading easier on the eye.
Vibrant colours create emotion and should be used sparingly (e.g. for buttons and call to actions). Last but not least, white space/ negative space is very effective at giving your website a modern and uncluttered look.

IMAGES
A picture can speak a thousand words, and choosing the right images for your website can help with brand positioning and connecting with your target audience. If you don’t have high quality professional photos on hand, consider purchasing stock photos to lift the look of your website.
Also consider using infographics, videos and graphics as these can be much more effective at communicating than even the most well written piece of text.

NAVIGATION
Navigation is about how easy it is for people to take action and move around your website. Some tactics for effective navigation include a logical page hierarchy, using bread crumbs, designing clickable buttons, and following the ‘three click rule’ which means users will be able to find the information they are looking for within three clicks.
Primary navigation options are typically deployed in a horizontal  menu  bar  along  the  top  of  the  site.
Footer navigation is found at the bottom of a page. Because of mobile design navigation is being explored more.
When styling navigation ensure that it is intuitive. If it is unconventional test it.

GRID BASED LAYOUTS
Placing content randomly on your web page can end up with a haphazard appearance that is messy. Grid based layouts arrange content into sections, columns and boxes that line up and feel balanced, which leads to a better looking website design.

“F” PATTERN DESIGN
Eye tracking studies have identified that people scan computer screens in an “F” pattern. Most of what people see is in the top and left of the screen and the right side of the screen is rarely seen. Rather than trying to force the viewer’s visual flow, effectively designed websites will work with a reader’s natural behaviour and display information in order of importance (left to right, and top to bottom).

LOAD TIME
Nobody likes a website that takes ages to load. Tips to make page load times more effective include optimising image size and scale, combining code into a central CSS or JS file (this reduces HTTP requests) and minify HTML, CSS, JS (compressed to speed up their load time).
MOBILE FRIENDLY
It is now commonplace to access websites from multiple devices with multiple screen sizes, so it is important to consider if your website is mobile friendly. If your website is not mobile friendly, you can either rebuild it in a responsive layout (this means your website will adjust to different screen widths) or you can build a dedicated mobile site (a separate website optimised specifically for mobile users).
Test your concept
According to Steve Krug, testing one user is 100% better than testing none and testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end. After you’ve worked on a site for few weeks, you can’t observe it from a fresh perspective anymore.
