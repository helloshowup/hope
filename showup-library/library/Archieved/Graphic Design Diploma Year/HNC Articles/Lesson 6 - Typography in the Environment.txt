What is Typography in the Environment?
Have you ever looked around you and noticed aspects of your surroundings that resemble letters or symbols? Like the roof of a house that looks like an ‘A’, the handle of a coffee mug that looks like a ‘C’, or perhaps a bathroom hook that bends like the letter ‘S’? 
Whether deliberate or unintentional, both nature and the built environment will take on shapes and forms that resemble letters. Organic and man-made things in our environment will have straight lines and curves and bumps that give them the appearance of letters of the alphabet. The eye will find shapes that form letters in nature or for instance, through objects, negative spaces in architecture, marks on walls or the ground, all around.
