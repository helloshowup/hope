ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS
The vibrant luminosity of gold leaf, as it reflected light from the pages of handwritten books, gave the sensation of the page being literally illuminated; this dazzling effect gave birth to the term illuminated manuscript.
Today this name is used for all decorated and illustrated handwritten books produced from the late Roman Empire until printed books replaced manuscripts. This came after typography was developed in Europe around A.D.1450.
Sacred writings held great meaning for Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The use of visual embellishment to expand the word became very important, and illuminated manuscripts were produced with extraordinary care and design sensitivity.

Manuscript production was costly and time- consuming. Parchment or vellum took hours to prepare, and a large book might require the skins of three hundred sheep.
Black ink for lettering was prepared from fine soot or lampblack. Gum and water were mixed with sanguine or red chalk to produce a red ink for headings and paragraph marks.
A brown ink was formulated from “irongall”. This was a mixture of iron sulfate and oak apples.
Colors were created from a variety of mineral, animal, and vegetable matter. A vibrant, deep blue was made from Lapis Lazuli, a precious mineral mined only in Afghanistan that found its way to monasteries as far away as Ireland.

The colophon of a manuscript or book is an inscription, usually at the end, containing facts about its production. Often the scribe, designer, or, later, printer is identified.
In the colophon of one illuminated manuscript,
a scribe named George declared,
“As the sailor longs for a safe haven at the end of his voyage, so does the writer for the last word.”
Another scribe, Prior Petris, described writing
as a terrible ordeal that
“dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits one’s chest and stomach together”
The reader was then advised to turn the pages carefully and to keep his finger far from the text.

Initials and Diminuendo
In Typography diminuendo is the art of arranging letters starting with a large initial and progressively diminishing the point size of the type as it runs into the body text, assuring a smooth transition between initial and body text.
Possibly the most captivating design features of illuminated manuscripts are these initials and the diminuendo, both of which are widely implemented in contemporary editorial design today as well.

The illustration and ornamentation were not just decoration. The monastic leaders were mindful of the educational value of pictures and the ability of ornament to create mystical and spiritual overtones. Most illuminated manuscripts were small enough to fit into a saddlebag.
This enabled the transmission of knowledge and ideas from one region to
another and one time period to another.
Manuscript production over the thousand-year course of the medieval era created a vast vocabulary of graphic forms, page layouts, illustration and lettering styles, and techniques.
Identifiable regional design styles in manuscript production emerged, developing important milestones in visual communication throughout the centuries.

The period from the collapse of Rome until the 8th century was a time of migration and upheaval throughout Europe, as different ethnic tribes fought for territory.
These unsettled times were the blackest decades of the medieval era. Wandering hordes of Germanic Barbarians did not invade the island of Ireland, tucked in the far corner of Europe, and the Celts living there enjoyed relative isolation and peace.
In the early fifth century A.D., Saint Patrick and other missionaries began to rapidly convert the Celts to Christianity.
In a fascinating melding of culture and religion, pagan temples were converted to churches and Celtic ornaments were applied to chalices and bells brought to Ireland by the missionaries.

Celtic design is abstract and extremely complex; geometric linear patterns weave, twist, and fill a space with thick visual textures. Bright, pure colors are used in close juxtaposition.
This Celtic craft tradition of intricate, highly abstract decorative patterns was applied to book design in the monastic scriptoria, and a new concept and image of the book emerged.
The interlace was a two-dimensional decoration formed by a number of ribbons or straps woven into a complex, usually symmetrical design.
Interlaces created by animal forms were called lacertines.

Insular
The term insular is used to refer to manuscripts produced in monastic centres in the British Isles in the 7th and 8th centuries. These were decorated in abstract linear patterns adapted from Anglo-Saxon and Celtic metalwork. Where zoomorphic forms were included these were stylised and either copied from earlier art or drawn from the imagination. Three forms of decoration are commonly found in insular manuscripts:
ornamented borders enclosing full page illustrations
ornate initials used for beginning of gospels
and important passages
and carpet pages, which are full pages of decorative designs.
Well known examples of Insular manuscripts are the Lindisfarne Gospels (c.698AD), the Book of Durrow (c.680AD) and the Book of Kells (c.800AD).

A radical design innovation in Celtic manuscripts was leaving a space between words to enable the reader to separate the string of letters into words more quickly. The half-uncial script journeyed to Ireland with the early missionaries and was subtly redesigned into the scriptura scottica, [now known as insular script], to suit the local visual traditions.
Characters are frequently joined at the waistline or the baseline. Ironically, these beautiful, carefully lettered half-uncials convey a text that is careless and contains misspellings and misreadings.
The Book of Kells is the culmination of Celtic illumination
generous margins and huge initial letters
far more full-page illustrations than in any other Celtic manuscript - executed with a remarkable density and complexity of form; over 2,100 ornate capitals through the course of its 339 leaves.

Carolingian
The Carolingian style is associate with the court of Charlemagne (A.D. 742–814), who set out to revive book design and production. They sometimes included sections written in gold or silver ink on purple vellum and often contained lavish quantities of gold.
The illuminations displayed a combination of two dimensional ornament and increased sense of three dimensions in the depiction of figures. The Old Testament was a popular subject; popular because its political themes appealed to a
courtly audience.	Drogo Sacramentary, ca. 850: a historiated initial 'C' contains the Ascension of Christ. The text is in gold ink.

Carolingian
Standardisation of page layout, writing style, and decoration was attempted. Efforts to reform the alphabet succeeded.
The Carolingian minuscule is the forerunner of our contemporary lowercase alphabet. This clear set of letterforms was practical and easy to write.
Roman capitals were studied and adopted for headings and initials of great beauty. These were not calligraphic but carefully drawn and
built up with more than one stroke.	Example of Carolingian Minuscule

Ottonian
The Ottonian style is associated with the courts of the Saxon emperors from 960-1060. Gospel books, and the Apocolypse were more popular than entire bibles.

GOTHIC MANUSCRIPTS
During the 1200s the rise of the universities created an expanding market for books.
For example, twenty thousand of Paris’s hundred thousand residents were students who flocked to the city to attend the university.
Literacy was on the rise, and professional lay illuminators emerged to help meet the growing demand for books.

The Book of Revelation had a surge of unexplained popularity in England and France during the 1200s. A scriptorium at Saint Albans with high artistic standards seems to have figured prominently in this development. At least ninety-three copies of the Apocalypse survive from this period.
The Douce Apocalypse written and illustrated around A.D. 1265, is one of the many masterpieces of Gothic illumination. Each of the hundred illustrated pages (three are now missing) has an illustration above two columns of beautifully lettered text.

On each page of the Douce Apocalypse, an open square is left in the upper-left corner for an initial, but these letters were never added. Some illustrations, drawn but never painted, show an even line of great sensitivity and decisiveness. The illustrations are divided into segments by elaborate framing.
The Douce Apocalypse represents a new breed of picture book that established the page design of the fifteenth-century woodblock books that emerged after printing came to Europe.

Judaic Manuscripts
Many of the finest Judaic illuminated manuscripts are Haggadot, containing Jewish religious literature, including historical stories and proverbs, especially the saga of the Jewish exodus from Egypt.
The Washington Haggadah is an exemplary representative of the genre (right).
The written word was supreme, while pictures played a supporting role and were pushed into generous margins at the sides or bottom of the space.
Judaic illuminated manuscripts are relatively rare.

Islamic Manuscripts
Islam, one of the world’s great religions, emerged from Muhammad’s teachings as recorded in the Qur’an.
This sacred book forms the divine authority for religious, social, and civil life in Islamic societies stretching south from the Baltic Sea to equatorial Africa, and eastward from the Atlantic coast of Africa to Indonesia.
Muhammad called upon his followers to learn to read and write, and calligraphy quickly became an important tool for religion and government. His advocacy of women’s literacy resulted in many important female calligraphers and scholars.

Islamic manuscript decoration emerged from modest origins. Early calligraphers who wrote seventh- and eighth-century copies of the Qur’an made their vowel marks ornate and drew rosettes to separate verses.
Over the centuries, ornamentation became increasingly elaborate, with intricate geometric and arabesque designs filling the space to become transcendental expressions of the sacred nature of the Qur’an.
Geometric shapes containing calligraphy are surrounded by rhythmic organic designs ranging from plant forms to abstract arabesques.

Figurative illustrations were not utilized because Islamic society embraced the principle of aniconism, which is religious opposition to representations of living creatures.
This was based on a belief that only God could create life and that mortals should not make figures of living things or create images that might be used as idols.
While this principle was strictly upheld in many Muslim areas, such as North Africa and Egypt, pictures were tolerated in some Islamic regions as long as they were restricted to private quarters and palace harems.

Late Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts
During the transitional decades, as the medieval era yielded to the European Renaissance, the production of illuminated manuscripts for private use became increasingly important. In the early 1400s the Book of Hours became Europe’s most popular book.
Books of Hours for the Duc de Berry.

French nobleman and brother of King Charles V, Jean, duc de Berry (1340–1416), who owned a vast portion of central France, installed the Limbourg brothers, of Dutch origin, in his castle to establish a private scriptorium.
The Duc de Berry owned one of the largest private libraries in the world at that time, with 155 books, including fourteen Bibles and fifteen Books of Hours.
However Books of Hours were not limited to the Duc de Berry's library.
Here are a few more samples from the 15th and 16th centuries:

The Limbourg brothers’ masterpiece was Les tres riches heures du duc de
Berry.
The first twenty-four pages are an illustrated calendar. Each month has a double-page spread with a genre illustration relating to seasonal activities of the month on the left page and a calendar of the saints’ days on the right.
