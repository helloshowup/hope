USABILITY TESTING
So youâ€™ve created some lo-fi wireframes in your sketchbook for your responsive website, the next step is to recreate them using a more interactive method. The intention here is to test the structure, navigation and layout of the website with real users to see if it is easy to use and has good flow.
Using Balsamic (or another similar interactive method), create an interactive wireframe of your website and link the pages before exporting as an interactive .PDF. The point of Usability testing in this regard is to create a simulation of your website that can be tested with real users. https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/
Structure & Navigation

Check compatibility with smartphones
Loading time (check images are optimized)
Scale of buttons are big for finger / selection
Checklist for further testing on final prototype / site (pre-launch)
No spelling or grammar errors
