Reflective writing is a type of writing that encourages designers to examine and analyse their experiences, project outcomes, and learning processes. It is an effective way to promote self-awareness, critical thinking, and personal growth. However, it can also be used for personal development, self-discovery, and in a number of professional contexts.

Key features of reflective writing include:
Self-examination and retrospection
Critical thinking and an analysis of an event or concept
Evaluation of the event or concept
Identification of areas for learning and growth
Reflective writing can be found in various formats, including journals, essays, blogs, and personal narratives. 
Reflection as a tool to inform practice
Reflection can be a valuable tool for solving graphic design problems in a variety of ways. When you engage in reflective practices as a designer, you can gain insights and make improvements by analysing your work, thought processes, and decision-making. Here are a few of the benefits of reflective writing and how it can improve your practice:
Identify areas for improvement
By reflecting on a design project, you can identify flaws, errors, or areas where the design is not meeting its intended goals or client requirements. This critical examination allows for the discovery of problems that might have been overlooked during the initial design process.
Understand user experience
Graphic design is often about creating solutions for end-users or the intended audience. Reflective thinking can help you put yourself in the shoes of the viewers or users, leading to a better understanding of the user experience. This understanding can reveal issues or areas for improvement in the design.
Iterative design process
Reflection is integral to the iterative design process. Graphic designers can analyse their initial design, gather feedback from their client, users, or other stakeholders, and then make adjustments based on that feedback. This cycle of reflection and refinement leads to a more effective and user-friendly final product.
Problem-Solving
Reflective thinking enables you to break down complex design problems into smaller, more manageable components. This can lead to the identification of creative and practical solutions.
Learning from Mistakes
Reflecting on graphic design projects and outcomes, especially those that didn't meet a client’s expectations, allows you to identify and learn from your mistakes to avoid them in future.
Exploring Alternative Approaches
Graphic designers can use reflection to explore alternative design approaches. By considering different perspectives and options, you may discover more innovative and effective solutions to design problems.
Clarifying Design Objectives
Reflection helps graphic designers clarify their project objectives and goals. This ensures that the design process remains focused on solving the core problem or addressing the client or audience’s primary needs.
Decision-Making
The design process involves making a series of decisions, from choosing colour schemes to specific layouts. Reflective thinking can help you understand the rationale behind your own decisions and evaluate whether they align with the design problem and objectives.
Reflective writing tips:
It is advisable to write and complete one reflection at a time.
Do not present a reflection full of “stories”, rather write a critical analysis of your experiences or work.
Write about the relevance and meaning of the experience to inform future projects.
Carefully analyse what you have learned as this is the key focus of the reflection.
Reflection is an exploration and an explanation of events - not just a description of them.
It involves revealing anxieties, errors, weaknesses as well as strengths and successes.
Select only the most significant parts of the experience or design concept to reflect upon. 
It is useful to “reflect forward” to the future as well as “reflecting back” on the past.

Gibbs’ reflective cycle
Gibbs’ reflective cycle is a popular reflection model used by scholars. The model includes 6 stages and rather than using for personal purposes, it should be used when you are asked to write a reflective essay as an assignment on this course:
Fig 4. Dye, V. (2011) Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle
Step 1: Description
In this step, you need to explain what you are reflecting on. It’s important to remember to keep your descriptions relevant and to-the-point. Don’t waffle on with unnecessary details. This is a waste of valuable time, energy and words and it will have a negative impact on your marks. 
A good example may be where you are reflecting on whether your particular design meets each of the requirements set out in the client brief.
Step 2: Feelings
Discuss your feelings and thoughts about the design project or experience. Consider questions such as: What did you think at the time? How did it make you feel? What did you think of the outcome of the final design?
For example, you may have initially felt hesitant to analyse a design brief as the client’s aesthetic vision did not support the primary goal of engaging the intended audience. 
Discuss your emotions honestly, but always remember that this is an academic piece of work, so avoid ‘chatty’ writing.
Step 3: Evaluation
For your evaluation, discuss how well you think things went in terms of both the experience and your graphic design outcomes. Perhaps consider: How did you react to a specific situation with your client? What was good and what was bad about the experience or project outcomes? If you are writing about a difficult incident, did you feel that the situation was resolved afterwards? If so, how? If not, why not? 
Imagine a scenario where you felt uncomfortable telling the client that you had concerns with their design requirements. You went ahead and designed something that answers their wishes, but, you know you could have produced something to a higher standard. So, on the one hand you did the right thing and satisfied the client’s brief, but you feel like you failed in effectively reaching and engaging the intended audience through your design.
This section is also a good place to include some theory and the work of other authors,  remembering it is important to include references in reflective writing.
Step 4: Analysis
In your analysis, consider what might have helped or hindered your work. You also have the opportunity here to compare your experience with the literature you have read. This section is very important, particularly for higher level writing. Many students receive poor marks for reflective assignments for not bringing the theory and experience together.
For instance, you realise that because you were not confident in approaching your client and having an honest discussion over your concerns, the final design is lacking in some areas.  
Step 5: Conclusion
In your conclusion, it is important to acknowledge: 
whether you could have done anything else 
what you have learned from the experience 
consider how you could have responded in a different way. 
For example, you recognise that you should have discussed and negotiated the details of the brief (e.g. colour and typography) with your client during your first meeting. This way, you could have found an alternative solution that married their needs with your professional experience and judgement. 
Step 6: Action plan
Action plans sum up anything that will be helpful for future reference.  Perhaps you feel that you need to upskill or attend some training. What can you do to be better equipped to cope with a similar project or experience?
In this hypothetical, a good action plan would include considering ways in which you can establish better trust with future clients and increase your confidence in expressing your professional opinions, even if it goes against some of the client’s initial ideas. This might involve role playing with a colleague or establishing a more explicit description of your approach, your intentions and your work style, etc. This will help clients understand that you hold some authority over the final product.
