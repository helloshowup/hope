Industrial Revolution:  A change from making things  by hand to producing them in  factories. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
From the 18th to the 19th century  major changes in agriculture,  manufacturing, mining, transport,  and technology had a profound  effect on the socioeconomic and  cultural conditions starting in the  United Kingdom, then subsequently  spreading throughout Europe,  North America, and eventually the  world.  
The Industrial Revolution is the  name given to a movement in  which machines changed  people's way of life as well as  their methods of manufacture.

Transportation  
Before the Industrial Revolution,  
people relied on the horse and  
their own feet to get around.  
With the invention of the steam  
locomotive, transportation took a  
huge step forward.

1780s - Steam Engine 
The steam engine was not  
just a transportation  
device. It ran entire  
factories the way rivers  
used to, and mill wheels  
no longer needed to build  
on rivers.

Textiles  
The spinning wheel was the first  
development, but it was very slow.  
Threads were spun one at a time, by  
hand.  
Soon after the invention of the  
spinning jenny and the power  
loom came about and the textile  
industry took off.  
Clothes could now be made far  
faster than ever before.

1764 - The Spinning Jenny  
The spinning jenny could  
spin up to eight threads at  
time. It was much faster  
than the spinning wheel.

1779 - The Spinning Mule  (Samuel Crompton)  
1785 - The Power Loom  (Edmund Cartwright)  
The Spinning Mule used water  power to spin the thread, which  was much faster than doing it  by hand.  
Textiles could now be made at  a faster pace and in bigger  quantities.  
The Power Loom was a more  advanced version of the Spinning  Mule.  
Water power was again used to  spin the thread but again the  quantity produced was greater.

Steel  
(Bessemer process - 1858) 
With the invention of steel, buildings could be made much taller.  Steel was much harder than iron, which would bend if made too tall.  The booming steel industry led to the invention of the car.

Glass  
A new method of producing glass, known as the cylinder process, was  developed in Europe during the early 19th century.  
In 1832, this process was used by the Chance Brothers to create sheet  glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass.  
The Crystal Palace (1854 to 1936) is the supreme example of the use of  sheet glass in a new and innovative structure. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Crystal Palace  
Crystal Palace was designed by  
Joseph Paxton to house the  
Great Exhibition of 1851.  
Queen Victoria came up with the  
idea of staging a worldwide  
exhibition of modern art and  
design.  
The glass and iron pavilion  
located in Hyde Park, was over  
564m long and had an interior  
height of 39m.  
It housed exhibits from all over  
the world and drew over 6 million  
visitors.

It took 9 months from start to finish  to build.  
Crystal Palace was the art – not  
the contents.  
After the exhibition, the structure  
was dismantled and moved to a  
new park “Penge Hill” 
Here the building hosted concerts,  performances and exhibitions until  it was destroyed by fire in 1936.

Pollution  
One of the downsides of industrialization was pollution.  
Population increase gave rise to child labour. Many children  developed lung cancer and other diseases and died before the age of  25.  
Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the  splendor of the homes of the factory owners to the squalor of the lives  of the workers. Poor people lived in very small houses in cramped  streets. These homes would share toilet facilities, have open sewers  and would be at risk of damp.  
As a result of the Revolution, huge numbers of the working class died  due to diseases spreading through the cramped living conditions.  Chest diseases from the mines, cholera from polluted water and  typhoid were also extremely common, as was smallpox. Accidents in  factories with children and workers were regular. Strikes and riots by  workers were also relatively common.

Graphic Design & The Industrial Revolution 
• Graphic communications became  more important and more widely  
available during this unsettled period  of change.  
• As with other commodities,  
technology lowered unit costs and  
increased the production of printed  materials.  
• As industry and production of  
consumer goods flourished, so too  did the need for advertisement.  
• Printing techniques using  
moveable type were restricted to an  
inflexible grid layout and limited  typeface options.

New Possibilities
Larger scale, greater visual impact,  and new tactile and expressive  characters were demanded, and the  book typography that had slowly  evolved from handwriting did not  fulfill these needs.  
It was no longer enough for the  twenty-six letters of the alphabet to  function only as phonetic symbols.  
The industrial age transformed  these signs into abstract visual  forms projecting powerful concrete  shapes of strong contrast and  large size.

The Industrial Revolution  Typography 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Joseph Jackson (1733–92) and  Thomas Cotterell (d. 1785),  became successful type  
designers.  
Cotterell began the trend of  sand-casting very large, bold  display letters.  
Other founders designed and  cast fatter letters, and type  grew steadily bolder.  
This led to the invention of fat  faces, a major category of type  design innovated by Cotterell’s  pupil and successor, Robert  Thorne (d. 1820) 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
A fat-face typestyle is a roman face whose contrast and weight have been  increased by expanding the thickness of the heavy strokes. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
The rapid tilt in typographic design taste toward modern-style romans after  the turn of the century, seriously upset a man called Vincent Figgins. He  responded with his 1815 Printing Specimen Book showing a full range of  modern styles, antiques (Egyptians also known as Slab-Serif) - the second  major innovation of nineteenth-century type design - and numerous jobbing  faces, including “three-dimensional” fonts.  
Above: Figgins’ Slab-Serif Font 
Below: Figgins’ “three-dimensional” font  
These typefaces had a bold, machinelike feeling through slab-like rectangular  serifs, even weight throughout the letters, and short ascenders and descenders. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Figgins’s 1815 specimen book also presented the first nineteenth-century  version of Tuscan-style letters.  
This style, characterized by serifs that are extended and curved, was put  through an astounding range of variations during the nineteenth century,  often with bulges, cavities, and ornaments.  
It seems that the English typefounders  
were trying to invent every possible design  
permutation by modifying forms or  
proportions and applying all manner of  
decoration to their alphabets. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Figgins showed styles that projected the illusion of three dimensions and  appeared as bulky objects rather than two-dimensional signs.  
This device proved very popular, and specimen books began to show  perspective clones for every imaginable style. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
An additional variation was the depth of shading, which ranged from pencil thin shadows to deep perspectives.  
Figgins’ Reversing Type 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Another major typographic innovation of the early 1800s, sans-serif  type, made its modest debut in an 1816 specimen book issued by  William Caslon.  
Buried among the decorative display fonts of capitals in the back of  Figgins’s 1815 specimen book, one line of medium-weight monoline  serifless capitals proclaimed “W CASLON JUNR LETTER FOUNDER.” It looked a lot like an Egyptian face with the serifs removed, which is  probably how Caslon IV designed it.  
The name Caslon adopted for this style (Two Lines English Egyptian)  tends to support the theory that it had its origins in an Egyptian style. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Sans serifs, which became so  
important to twentieth- century  
graphic design, had a tentative  
beginning.  
They were little noticed until  
the early 1830s, when several  
typefounders introduced new  
sans-serif styles.  
Perhaps the rich black color of these display types seemed similar to  the density of Gothic types. Vincent Figgins dubbed his 1832  specimen Sans Serif, in recognition of the font’s most apparent  feature, and the name stuck. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Wood was a preferred material for large printing because of it's lightness,  availability, printing qualities and difficulties with large metal printing plates  curving slightly.  
In 1827 the pressure for large type was answered by Darius Wells ( a  printer of New York City) with the invention of a system for the mass  production of wood type.  
Wells invented a special wood drill that used a lateral router capable of  cutting letters on type-high end cut wood blocks.  
Traditionally a letter was drawn by a  
printer and was given to a carpenter,  
who then drew the letters onto wood,  
or paper which was pasted to the  
wood, then cut around the letter with a  
knife or graver, gouging out the parts  
to be left blank. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
William Leavenworth (1799–1860) combined the pantograph with  the router in 1834. This resulted in new wood-type fonts being  introduced so easily that customers were invited to send a drawing of  one letter of a desired new style. The manufactory would then offer to  design and produce the entire font based on the sketch without  an additional charge for design and pattern drafting.

The introduction of this new display typography and the increasing  demand for public posters by clients ranging from traveling circuses  and theatrical groups to clothing stores and the new railroads led to  poster houses specializing in letterpress display material. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
The design of handbills, wood-type posters, and  broadsheets at the poster houses did not involve a  graphic designer in the twentieth-century sense.  
The compositor, who was often in consultation with  the client, selected and composed the type, rules,  ornaments, and wood-engraved or metal stereotyped stock illustrations that filled the  typecases.  
The designer had access to a nearly infinite range of  typographic sizes, styles, weights, and novel  ornamental effects, and the design philosophy was  to use it.

Design decisions were pragmatic.  Long words or copy dictated  condensed type, and short words  or copy were set in expanded  fonts.  
Important words were given  emphasis through the use of the  largest available type sizes. There  was a practical side to the  extensive mixing of styles in job  printing, because many fonts,  each having a limited number of  characters, were available at the  typical print shop.  
Wood and metal types were used  together freely.

Several improvements to make the hand press stronger and more efficient  culminated in Lord Stanhope’s printing press constructed completely of  cast-iron parts in 1800.  
The metal screw mechanism required approximately one-tenth the  manual force needed to print on a wooden press, and Stanhope’s press  enabled a doubling of the printed sheet’s size. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
The next step actually converted printing into a high-speed factory  operation.  
Friedrich Koenig, a German printer who arrived in London around 1804,  presented his plans for a steam-powered printing press to major London  printers.  
His press printed 400 sheets per hour in comparison to the hourly output  of 250 sheets on the Stanhope hand press.

On 29 November 1814. At six o’clock John Walter II of the Times news  entered the pressroom and announced;  
“The Times is already printed - by steam.”  
The day’s edition informed its readers;  
“Our Journal of this day presents to the public the practical result of the  greatest improvement connected with printing since the discovery of the  art itself. The reader of this paragraph now holds in his hand one of the  
many thousand impressions of The Times newspaper, which were taken  off last night by a mechanical apparatus.”  
An immediate savings resulted in the composing room, for the Times had  been typesetting a duplicate of each edition so the two hand presses could  print each page. Also, the news could be printed to reach subscribers  several hours earlier.

In 1815 William Cowper obtained a patent for a printing press using  curved stereotyped plates wrapped around a cylinder. This press  achieved 2,400 impressions per hour, and it could be used to print 1,200  sheets on both sides.  
In 1827 the Times commissioned Cowper to develop a four-cylinder  steam-powered press using curved stereotyped plates made rapidly  from papier-mâché molds.  
This press printed 4,000 sheets per hour, on both sides  
The value of high-speed steam-powered printing would have been limited  without an economical and abundant source of paper however, leading to  further industry and refinement of paper manufacturing! 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Setting type by hand and then redistributing it into the job case remained a  slow and costly process. By the middle of the nineteenth century, presses  could produce twenty-five thousand copies per hour, but each letter in every  word in every book, newspaper, and magazine had to be set by hand.  
Ottmar Mergenthaler was a German  
immigrant working in a Baltimore  
machine shop who struggled for a  
decade to perfect his typesetting.  
On 3 July 1886, the thirty-two-year-old  
inventor demonstrated his keyboard 
operated machine in the office of the  
New York Tribune. Whitelaw Reid, the  
editor of the Tribune, reportedly  
exclaimed, “Ottmar, you’ve done it! A  
line o’ type.” The new machine  
received its name from this enthusiastic  
reaction. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
In 1880 the New York newspapers  offered over half a million dollars in  prizes to any inventor who could create  a machine that would reduce the  compositor’s time by 25 to 30 percent;  
Mergenthaler’s Linotype machine could  do the work of seven or eight hand  compositors!  
The rapid deployment of the Linotype  replaced thousands of highly skilled  hand-typesetters, and strikes and  violence threatened many installations.  
But the new technology caused an  unprecedented explosion of graphic  material, creating thousands of new  jobs. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
The three-cent price of an 1880s  newspaper plunged to one or two  pennies, while the number of pages  multiplied and circulation soared.  
Book publishing expanded rapidly,  with fiction, biographies, technical  books, and histories joining the  educational texts and literary  classics that were being issued.  
The Linotype led to a surge in the  production of periodicals, and  illustrated weeklies, including the  Saturday Evening Post reached  audiences of millions by the turn of  the century.

The Industrial Revolution  Photography 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Joseph Niepce (1765–1833), the  Frenchman who first produced a  photographic image, began his research  by seeking an automatic means of  transferring drawings onto printing plates.  
In 1822 he coated a pewter sheet with a  light-sensitive asphalt, called bitumen of  Judea, that hardens when exposed to light.  Then he contact-printed a drawing, which  had been oiled to make it transparent, to  the pewter with sunlight.  
Niepce washed the pewter plate with  lavender oil to remove the parts not  hardened by light, and then he etched it  with acid to make an incised copy of the  original. Niepce called his invention  heliogravure (sun engraving) 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
This is the first known photograph by  Niepse. There is little merit in this  picture other than that fact. It is difficult  to interpret; the building is on the left, a  tree a third in from the left, and a barn  immediately in front. The exposure  lasted eight hours, so the sun had  time to move from east to west,  appearing to shine on both sides of the  building. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Louis Jacques Daguerre (1799–1851), had been conducting similar  research, and on 7 January 1839 his perfected process was presented to  the French Academy of Sciences.  
The members marveled at the clarity and minute detail of his  daguerreotype prints and the incredible accuracy of the images.  
In his perfected process, a highly polished silver-plated copper sheet was  sensitized by placing it, silver side down, over a container of iodine  crystals. After the rising iodine vapor combined with the silver to produce  light-sensitive silver iodide, the plate was placed in the camera and  exposed to light coming through the lens, to produce a latent image. The  bare metal appeared black in areas where no light had struck it.  
The luminous, vibrant image was a base relief of mercury and silver  compounds that varied in intensity in direct proportion to the amount of light  that had struck the plate during exposure.

Louis Jacques Daguerre, Paris boulevard, 1839. In this early daguerreotype,  the wagons, carriages, and pedestrians were not recorded because the slow  exposure could only record stationary objects. On the lower left street  corner, a man stopped to have his boots polished. He and the polisher were  the first people ever to be photographed. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Simultaneous research was conducted in England by William Henry Fox  Talbot (1800–77), who pioneered a process that formed the basis for both  photography and photographic printing plates.  
Talbot called these images, made  
without a camera, photogenic  
drawings.  
Today we call images made by  
manipulating with objects the light  
striking photographic paper  
photograms.  
The technique was often used by  
twentieth-century graphic designers. 
Graphic Design – INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
Upon learning about the research of Daguerre and Talbot, the eminent  astronomer and chemist Sir John Herschel (1792–1871) tackled the  problem of the “opposite image”.  
On 1 February 1839 he shared this knowledge with Talbot. Both  Daguerre and Talbot adopted this means of fixing the image.  
During that month Talbot solved the problem of the reversed image by  contact printing his reverse image to another sheet of his sensitized  paper in sunlight.  
Herschel named the reversed image a negative and called the contact  a positive. These terms and Herschel’s later name for Talbot’s  invention, photography, have been adopted throughout the world.

An American dry-plate manufacturer, George Eastman (1854–1932), put  the power of photography into the hands of the lay public when he  introduced his Kodak camera in 1888.  
It was an invention without precedent, for ordinary citizens now had the  ability to create images and keep a graphic record of their lives and  experiences.

The first photomechanical colour  illustrations were printed in the 1881  Christmas issue of the Paris magazine  L’llustration.  
Complicated and time-consuming,  photomechanical color separation  remained experimental until the end of the  century. During the 1880s and 1890s,  photomechanical reproduction began to  rapidly make obsolete the highly skilled  craftsmen who transferred artists’ designs  to handmade printing plates.  
Up to a week had been required to prepare  a complex wood engraving; the  
photographic processes reduced the time  from art to printing plate to one or two  hours, with greatly reduced costs.

When the American Civil War began, Mathew Brady (c. 1823–96). set out  in a white duster and straw hat carrying a handwritten card from Abraham  Lincoln reading “Pass Brady—A. Lincoln.”  
During the war Brady invested a $100,000 fortune to send a score of his  photographic assistants to document the American Civil War. From  Brady’s photography wagons, called “Whatsit” by the Union troops, a  great national trauma was etched forever in the collective memory.  
Brady’s photographic documentation had a profound impact upon the  public’s romantic ideal of war. Battlefield photographs joined artist’s  sketches as reference materials for wood-engraved magazine and  newspaper illustrations.

An adventurous photographer, Eadweard Muybridge (1830–1904) lived in  San Francisco. Leland Stanford, a former governor of California and the  president of the Central Pacific Railroad, commissioned Muybridge to  document his belief that a trotting horse lifted all four feet off the ground  simultaneously; a $25,000-dollar wager rested on the outcome.  
While working on the problem, Muybridge became interested in  photographing a horse’s stride at regular intervals. Success came in 1877  and 1878, when a battery of twenty-four cameras—facing an intense white  background in the dazzling California sunlight—was equipped with rapid  drop shutters that were slammed down by springs and rubber bands as a  trotting horse broke threads attached to the shutters.  
The resulting sequence of photographs arrested the horse’s movement in  time and space, and Stanford, a breeder and racer of trotters, won the bet.

The development of motion-picture photography, the kinetic medium of  changing light passing through a series of still photographs joined together  by the human eye through the persistence of vision, was the logical  extension of Muybridge’s innovation.
