In graphic design, lettering refers to the creation and arrangement of letters, words, and symbols to convey a message or communicate information in a visually appealing and artistic way. Lettering builds the shape and form of each character from multiple, often numerous, manual strokes or actions. A digitally drawn logo, a customized neon sign, and a chiseled inscription on a church doorway are all examples of lettering.

Although similar, it differs from handwriting in that its main focus is usually on technique and visual appearance. While speed may be important in lettering, it is generally the end product that is the primary aim.
In contrast to lettering, type is a set of ready-made shapes which enables the reproduction of similar- or identical-looking letters. The ability to create and reproduce pre existing characters through a single action (e.g. hitting a key on your keyboard) is the strength of a typeface. For example, you can type an “A” thousands of times and achieve a consistent result, yet handwriting or lettering the same character will produce variations. Even master letterers cannot duplicate exactly the same form from one instance to another, variations will inevitably occur.

Letters also have a flexibility that standard typefaces do not. Letters and words can be built from any materials or medium from the most appropriate to the bizarre such as pencil to stainless steel to chocolate syrup. It can also be compressed, warped, or interlocked to fit a particular space.

Unlike pre-designed fonts, lettering is a one-of-a-kind creation designed for a specific application. It allows designers to infuse a unique, handcrafted, and personalized quality into their designs that can set it apart from other designs.

Here are some key aspects and benefits of lettering that you need to know as a graphic designer:
Lettering involves handcrafted letters (i.e. manually created), often by a skilled artist or designer. This can include drawing, painting, or using various tools and techniques to craft custom letterforms.
One of the primary advantages of lettering is the ability to customize each letter, word, or sentence to suit the specific requirements of a design project. This customization allows for a high degree of creativity and uniqueness.
Lettering can be executed in a wide range of styles, from traditional calligraphy and brush lettering to modern and experimental forms. Different tools, such as pens, brushes, markers, or digital tablets, can be used to achieve varied visual effects.
Lettering is applied in various design contexts, including logos, packaging, editorial design, advertising, posters, signage, and more. It adds a human touch and a sense of craftsmanship to the design, distinguishing it from more standardized typography.
Lettering can be applied to different surfaces and materials, both physical and digital. It is not limited to paper but can be used on chalkboards, walls, glass, websites, and other media.
With advancements in digital tools, lettering can also be created using software and digital platforms. Digital lettering provides additional flexibility and enables designers to combine handcrafted aesthetics with the advantages of digital technology.

Becoming proficient in handcrafted lettering requires practice and a deep understanding of letterforms. Many artists and designers engage in ongoing learning, experimenting with different styles and techniques to hone their craft. However, since digital fonts can quickly reproduce effects similar, though not usually equal, to custom lettering, graphic designers have replaced most lettering artists. The loss of personality and individuality found in handwriting and lettering is an unfortunate side effect of the proliferation of type. Nonetheless, an exponentially growing library of new and more sophisticated typefaces continues to increase the range of types.
Whether created by hand or digitally, lettering plays a crucial role in the visual language of graphic design, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal and effectiveness of a design piece.
