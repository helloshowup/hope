Graphic design and photography are two closely intertwined disciplines. Both are concerned with the creation of visual images, but they do so in different ways. Graphic designers use typography, layout, and other design elements to communicate messages and ideas. Photographers use light, composition, and other techniques to capture images of the world around them.
Graphic designers often use photography in their work. Photographs can be used to add visual interest to a design, to convey a certain mood or emotion, or to illustrate a specific concept. For example, a graphic designer might use a photograph of a beautiful sunset in a travel brochure, or a photograph of people smiling in an advertisement for a new product.

Photography can also be used to create standalone graphic design pieces, such as posters, infographics, and album covers. For example, a graphic designer might use a photograph of a protest to create a poster for a social justice campaign, or a photograph of a new product to create an infographic for a company's website.
In addition to using photography in their work, graphic designers can also benefit from learning the basics of photography. This is because photography teaches you how to see the world in a new way. It teaches you how to compose images, how to use light, and how to capture the essence of a moment.

Here are some of the benefits of graphic designers learning the basics of photography:
Improved visual composition skills. Photography teaches you how to arrange elements in a frame to create a visually appealing image. This skill can be directly applied to graphic design, where you need to arrange text, images, and other elements on a page or screen in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.
Better understanding of light. Photography also teaches you how to use light to create different effects in your images. This knowledge can be used to create more dynamic and engaging graphic designs. For example, you can use light to create shadows, highlights, and silhouettes to add depth and interest to your work.
Ability to take your own photographs. If you know the basics of photography, you will be able to take your own photographs for your graphic design projects. This can save you time and money, and it can also give you more control over the visual quality of your work.
Overall, photography is an essential skill for graphic designers to learn. By understanding the basics of photography, graphic designers can improve their visual composition skills, develop a better understanding of light, and create more dynamic and engaging designs.
In the next session of this lesson, you will be introduced to some basic camera settings and techniques that you can use to take photographs for your own graphic design projects. While it can be helpful to have a dedicated camera equipment, you do not need anything special to try these techniques out for yourself. Today, the camera on most phones have manual settings that can be adjusted to suit your needs.
