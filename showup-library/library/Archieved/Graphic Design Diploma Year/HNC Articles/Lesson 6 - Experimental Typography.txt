What is Experimental Typography?
Experimental typography refers to the unconventional and innovative use of typography through the design and arrangement of text in ways that go beyond traditional rules and conventions. It involves pushing the boundaries of typographic design to create new and unique visual experiences. Designers and artists use experimental typography to explore alternative forms of expression, to challenge established norms and to communicate in non-traditional ways.
Characteristics of Experimental Typography
Here are some general characteristics of experimental typography:
Following unconventional layouts and breaking away from the standard arrangement of elements and grid-based layouts.
Playing with a variety of font forms to create contrast and emphasis.
Use of colour, tone, form and/or texture to enhance visual appeal and create a multi-sensory experience.
Integrating of graphic elements, like illustrations or images.
Including dynamic or animated text (i.e. motion typography)
Using 3D forms thus creating depth and perspective in the composition of the typeface.
