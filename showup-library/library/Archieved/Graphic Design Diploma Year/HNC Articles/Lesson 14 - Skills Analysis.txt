The Value of Analysing Own Skills
Self analysis is a valuable practice for a graphic designer to implement both professionally, and for personal growth. 
Firstly, conducting a self-analysis of your skills can help you to pinpoint your strengths and uncover areas that need further improvement. Knowing your strengths allows you to leverage them for better results, while recognising weaknesses gives you a chance to work on them. Identifying the latter also helps you to set professional short and long term goals to determine the best approach for personal development in those areas. This can include training, practice, or education.

For example, you may be an excellent illustrator who can generate highly creative and engaging imagery in minutes. But, when it comes to working with others, you are not as skilled or confident which makes communication among team members and clients challenging. This could be an opportunity to focus your time on developing your interpersonal relationships. One way to get more comfortable at hosting briefing meetings or delivering design presentations for example, is to role-play with a trusted friend or colleague. 
A graphic designer who considers themselves highly skilled in all areas (which is rare) can in fact, lead to disaster. Being honest with yourself about the strengths and weaknesses that are identified through a skills analysis will make you aware of your limitations and will be ultimately beneficial when it comes to client satisfaction. One example could be that it will help you avoid overcommitting to an unrealistic timeline or to a project that requires experience and expertise outside of your comfort zone. Failing to meet client expectations can damage your reputation, it is therefore better to know the skills that you can bring to the table and who you are as a designer.
Being able to analyse your skillset can also help when you are placed in a team environment. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses as well as the team’s, allows you to assign roles and collaborate more effectively. You can focus on tasks that align with your expertise and, in areas that aren’t your strength, you can seek assistance from colleagues.

Finally, analysing your skills is essential for career growth and to stay current in an evolving industry. It helps you make informed decisions when pursuing new job opportunities, freelancing, or starting your own design business. A clear understanding of your skills allows you to position yourself effectively in the market and to target specific niches or industries where your expertise is most valued. It can also help you to identify areas where you need to update your skill set. 
How To Do A Skills Analysis
Conducting a skills analysis involves a structured process of evaluating your current abilities, strengths, and areas for improvement. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:
Define Your Goals
Determine what you want to achieve by doing a skills analysis. Are you looking to improve specific design techniques? Do you want to diversify your skill set? Perhaps you seek to position yourself for a particular job role?
List Relevant Skills
Make a comprehensive list of the general skills relevant to graphic design or a specific specialism. This could include technical skills (e.g. proficiency in design software), creative skills (e.g. illustration, typography), or soft skills (e.g. time management).
Self-Assessment
Evaluate your proficiency in each skill on your list. Use a scale (e.g. from 1 to 5) to rate your competency, with 1 being novice and 5 being expert. Be honest and objective in your assessment.
Prioritise Skills
Identify the skills that are most critical to achieving your goals. Focus on those that align with your career aspirations or the specific projects you want to tackle.
Seek External Feedback
It is best to also get input from peers, mentors, or clients. They can offer a different perspective and may highlight skills or areas of expertise that you may not have considered.
Identify Strengths and Acknowledge Weaknesses
Note the skills where you excel as well as areas where you could use improvement. Your strengths should be showcased in your portfolio and emphasised in your professional interactions, whereas your weaknesses could be used to set goals for further development. This could be anything from technical skills to soft skills like client communication.
Set SMART Goals
Based on your self-assessment and feedback from others, establish Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals for skill improvement. For example, if you want to improve your illustration skills, set a goal like "Complete three digital illustrations per week for the next three months."
Create an Action Plan
Break down your goals into actionable steps. This could involve taking online courses, practising regularly, attending workshops, or seeking mentorship.
Allocate Time and Resources
Dedicate time in your schedule for skill-building activities. Allocate resources like money for courses, subscriptions to design tools, or access to relevant materials.
Track Progress
Regularly review your progress. Adjust your approach if needed, and celebrate achievements along the way. Also make time to revisit your skills analysis so that you can keep progressing in your career and adjust your focus accordingly. 
Example Of A Skills Analysis Template
Below is an excerpt from a Skills Analysis template:
Fig 3. Example of a Skills Analysis (one cluster/section)
This snapshot only shows one area or ‘cluster’ of skills, but other sections should make up the remaining analysis, such as:
Graphic Design Skills, e.g. print design, colour theory, layout, etc.
Technical Skills, e.g. freehand sketching, CAD, presentations, etc.
Personal Skills, e.g. self-motivated, positive, team player, etc.
Knowledge, e.g. design history, style trends, materials, etc.
Business Skills, e.g. marketing, brand promotion, negotiation, etc.
In each skills cluster, evaluate and rate your skills level from no skill (1) to professional (4). In the final column, justify the score you gave for each skill. When you are finished, add up your total score in each cluster to identify your strengths and weaknesses (skills gaps). You can then use the information in your skills analysis to create a plan for professional development.
