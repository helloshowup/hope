Why study the History of Graphic Design?
In order to move forward in any subject, it is imperative to know what has come before. Not only to learn from past mistakes, but to avoid repeating them. As a student of graphic design, there are many great artists and designers that have carved out the path on which today’s designers walk and without an insight into the work of past masters, a student will limit their understanding of the subject.
The history of graphic design has always gone hand in hand with societal change and technological innovations. For over a century and a half, designers have responded to political, economic, cultural and technological developments using their creative voices and unique approaches. 
Understanding the evolution of visual communication allows you to ground your own work in a rich historical context and provides inspiration for your own creativity. Analysing the works of designers from the past helps you to cultivate a strong visual vocabulary. It will also enhance your problem solving skills as you cultivate your own techniques in the art of critical thinking.
