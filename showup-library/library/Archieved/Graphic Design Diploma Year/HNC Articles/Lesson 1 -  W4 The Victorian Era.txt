The Victorian Era
Introduction
The Victorian Era Background
The Victorian Era spans the period of the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837-1901.
The momentum and innovations of the Industrial Revolution (1760-1820/40) laid the groundwork for the arts and industry to
continue to flourish during the Victorian Era.
Under the reign of Queen Victoria there was an emphasis, culturally and socially, on a strict religious/moral code, belief in industrialisation and progress, optimism, nostalgia, an increasing distinction between the social classes and the continued rise of elitism.
Design of this period is characterised by excess of ornamentation and decoration.

The Victorian Design Aesthetic
Aesthetic Confusion
The Victorians searched for a design spirit to express the era. Aesthetic confusion led to a number of often contradictory design approaches and philosophies mixed together in a scattered fashion.
Gothic Influence
A fondness for the Gothic, which suited the pious Victorians, was fostered by the English architect A.
W. N. Pugin (1812–52), who designed the ornamental details of the British Houses of Parliament.
Although Pugin said he looked to earlier periods— particularly the Gothic—not for style but for a principle, the net result of his influence was a wide mimicking of Gothic architecture, ornament, and letterforms.

Eclectic Mix
The style has often been described as confused as seen here on the Title Page of Nature from 1844.
This example demonstrates the eclectic confusion of this era.
Medieval letterforms, baroque plant designs and Celtic interlaces are combined into a dense symmetrical design.

Engageantes
Engageantes were detachable false sleeves. They were commonly made from fine lace or linens and were easy to remove and restitch.
The Cage
In the mid-1850s, a patent for a steel hoop was introduced to the fashion world. The steel "cage" supported the dress and petticoats, while allowing legs to move freely under the dress.
Victorian Era – Fashion
Bonnets began to replace hats midway through the Victorian era. Lavishly trimmed bonnets stayed in fashion for half a century and weren't worn much after 1890.
The Bodice
The bodice was a staple fashion piece in the Victorian era

Victorian Graphic Design
Victorian graphic design captured and conveyed the values of the era.
Sentimentality, nostalgia, and a principle of idealized beauty were expressed through printed images of children, maidens, puppies, and flowers.
The production medium used for Victorian popular graphics was chromolithography, an innovation of the Industrial Revolution that unleashed a flood of colourful printed images.

Design Style
Highly illustrative and decorative designs where image and type are integrated and heavily ornamented.
The Butterfly Brand can label and “peacock” trade card demonstrate the integration of illustration with decorative patterns derived from Jones’s Grammar of Ornament.
The upper left corner of the “peacock” trade card is being peeled away to reveal a geometric pattern underneath.

Design Style
Travelling amusements such as circuses and carnivals commissioned large posters to herald their arrival.
Producers of entertainment spectaculars favoured dramatic illustrations with bold, simple lettering placed on brightly coloured backgrounds and borders.

Design Style
Complex montage designs promoting travelling shows, literary works, and theatrical performances engaged viewers.
Compared to contemporary posters, these advertisements were designed for greater viewing time because of the slower pace of nineteenth- century life and the relative lack of competition from other colourful images.

Key Figures – Louis Prang & Co.
After producing Christmas images suitable for framing in the late 1860s, Louis Prang and Co. published an English Christmas card in 1873 and American Christmas cards the following year.
Typical images included Santa Claus, reindeer, and Christmas trees.
A full line of designs followed, and Easter, birthday, Valentine, and New Year’s Day cards were produced annually by L. Prang and Company during the early 1880s.
Prang sometimes used as many as forty stones for one design. Exceptional quality was achieved by dropping the master black plate in favour of a slow building and heightening of the image through the use of many plates bearing subtle colours.

Key Figures – Walter Crane
Before the Victorian era, Western countries had a tendency to treat children as “little adults.” The Victorians developed a more tender attitude, and this was expressed through the development of toy books, colourful picture books for preschool children.
Several English artists produced books that were well designed and illustrated, with a restrained use of colour, establishing an approach to children’s graphics that is still in use today.

Key Figures – Walter Crane
It is generally acknowledged that Walter Crane (1845–1915) was one of the earliest and the most influential designers of children’s picture books.
Apprenticed as a wood engraver as a teenager, Crane was twenty years old in 1865 when his Railroad Alphabet was published.
A long series of his toy books broke with the traditions of printed material for children.
Earlier graphics for children insisted on a didactic or moral purpose, and always taught or preached to the young; Crane sought only to entertain.
Crane remained active into the twentieth century. He played an important role in the Arts and Crafts movement and had a significant impact on art and design education.
Key Figures – Randolph Caldecott
As a bank clerk in his twenties, Randolph Caldecott (1846–86) developed a passion for drawing and took evening lessons in painting, sketching, and modelling.
A steady stream of freelance assignments encouraged him to move to London and turn professional at the age of twenty-six.
He possessed a unique sense of the absurd, and his ability to exaggerate movement and facial expressions of both people and animals brought his work to life.
Caldecott created a world where dishes and plates are personified, cats make music, children are at the centre of society, and adults become servants. His humorous drawing style became a prototype for children’s books and later for animated films.

Caldecott transformed the world of children's books in the Victorian era. Children eagerly awaited the two books illustrated by him, priced at a shilling each, which came out each Christmas for eight years.
Key Figures – Kate Greenaway
Kate Greenaway’s (1846–1901) expressions of the childhood experience captured the imagination of the Victorian era. As a poet and illustrator, Greenaway created a modest, small world of childhood happiness; as a book designer, she sometimes pushed her graceful sense of page layout to innovative levels.
Key Figures – Kate Greenaway
The clothes Greenaway designed for her models had a major influence on children’s fashion design. Walter Crane, however, complained that Greenaway “overdid the big bonnet, and her little people are almost lost in their clothes.” For Greenaway, childhood became an idealized fantasy world, and the Victorian love of sentiment and idealization made her an internationally renowned graphic artist whose books are still in print.

Editorial & Advertising
Editorial Design – Harper and Brothers
James (1795–1869) and John (1797–1875) Harper used modest savings to launch a New York printing firm in 1817. Their younger brothers Wesley (1801–70) and Fletcher (1807–77) joined the firm in 1823 and 1825 respectively.
By midcentury, Harper and Brothers had become the largest printing and publishing firm in the world. In the role of senior editor and manager of publishing activities, Fletcher Harper shaped graphic communications in America for half a century.
The firm opened the era of the pictorial magazine in 1850 when the 144-page Harper’s New Monthly Magazine began publication with serialized English fiction and numerous woodcut illustrations created for each issue by the art staff.
The monthly magazine was joined by a weekly periodical that functioned as a newsmagazine, Harper’s Weekly, in 1857. Harper’s Bazar [sic] for women was founded in 1867, and the youth audience was addressed by Harper’s Young People in 1879.
Harper’s Weekly billed itself as “a journal of civilization” and developed an elaborate division of shop labor for the rapid production of woodblocks for printing cartoons and graphic reportage based on drawings from artist/ correspondents, including Thomas Nast (1840–1902).
Charles Parsons became the art editor of Harper and Brothers in 1863, and he helped raise the standard of pictorial images in the company’s publications. Parsons had a superb eye for young talent, and one illustrator he brought along was Charles Dana Gibson (1867–1944), whose images of young women and square-jawed men established a canon of physical beauty in the mass media that endured for decades.
Advertising
Many of the conventions of persuasive selling were developed during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Advertisements from the English and American magazines of the period demonstrate some of these techniques.

Key Figures – John F. Cumming
John F. Cumming (b. 1852) designed numerous elaborated typefaces for the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston, but the passion for ornate Victorian typefaces began to decline in the 1890s, yielding to the revival of classical typography, inspired by the English Arts and Crafts movement …

Matthew Algie Esq. first began blending tea consignments in 1864, proudly packing them for Victorian Tea Pavilions. Over 140 years later, the company continues to take pride in its rich history (and its tea, of course) and wanted us to create a new identity to reinforce this reputation.
Having assessed their competitors and target audience, we aimed to acknowledge the product’s heritage while appealing to the more contemporary tea-drinker. We sourced old Victorian drawings to emphasise Matthew Algie’s past – choosing an individual teapot for each of the 10 teas and infusions – and balanced this vintage style with vibrant, contemporary colours.
The final identity was rolled out to incorporate brand guidelines, packaging, point of sale and promotional literature.
