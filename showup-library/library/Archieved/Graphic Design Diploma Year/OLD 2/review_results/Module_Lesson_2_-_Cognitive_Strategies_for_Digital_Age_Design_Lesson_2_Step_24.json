Effective feedback systems not only improve your designs but demonstrate the professional maturity employers seek. These practical templates bridge your individual creative process with the collaborative workflows you'll encounter in professional environments, preparing you for the complex feedback ecosystems in multi-platform campaigns.\n\n## Template 1: Visual Annotation Feedback Framework\n\nThis template transforms vague opinions into actionable design insights:\n\n```\nDesign Element | Feedback Type | Comment | Priority (1-5) | Action Required\n---------------|--------------|---------|----------------|----------------\nTypography     | Readability  | \"Body text too small on mobile\" | 4 | Increase to 16px minimum\nColor Scheme   | Accessibility| \"Insufficient contrast in nav menu\" | 5 | Adjust to meet WCAG AA standards\nLayout         | Usability    | \"CTA button position inconsistent\" | 3 | Standardize position across pages\n```\n\n**Professional application:** When presenting work to clients or creative directors, this structured format demonstrates your technical understanding and problem-solving approach. It transforms subjective feedback into concrete improvements you can implement in Adobe XD or Figma.\n\n## Template 2: User Experience Survey\n\nThis template helps collect quantitative data about user interactions:\n\n```\nQuestion | Rating Scale (1-5) | Open Response\n---------|-------------------|---------------\nHow intuitive was the navigation experience? | \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 | What specific elements helped or hindered navigation?\nHow effectively did the visual design communicate the brand values? | \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 | Which design elements best represented the brand?\nHow consistent was the design across different screen sizes? | \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 | Where did you notice any inconsistencies?\n```\n\n**Portfolio value:** Including user testing data in your portfolio demonstrates your user-centered approach. This template helps you gather meaningful insights that inform your design decisions\u2014a skill employers actively seek in junior designers.\n\n## Template 3: Stakeholder Feedback Matrix\n\nThis template helps prioritize feedback from different project stakeholders:\n\n```\nStakeholder | Feedback | Business Impact (1-5) | Technical Feasibility (1-5) | Implementation Priority\n------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------\nClient      | \"Brand colors need more prominence\" | 5 | 4 | High\nEnd Users   | \"Mobile menu difficult to access\" | 4 | 3 | High\nMarketing   | \"Need more prominent social sharing\" | 3 | 5 | Medium\n```\n\n**Industry relevance:** This approach mirrors professional agency workflows where competing priorities must be balanced. It helps you develop the critical thinking skills needed when working with multiple stakeholders\u2014essential for the sustainable fashion campaign project you'll tackle next.\n\n## Template 4: Iterative Design Feedback Tracker\n\nThis template documents feedback across multiple design iterations:\n\n```\nDesign Version | Key Feedback | Changes Implemented | Remaining Issues | Responsible Designer\n---------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------\nV1.0           | \"Typography hierarchy unclear\" | Adjusted font weights and sizes | Spacing inconsistencies | [Your Name]\nV1.1           | \"Improved hierarchy, mobile layout issues\" | Implemented responsive grid | Image optimization needed | [Team Member]\n```\n\n**Professional workflow:** This creates a documented history of your design evolution\u2014valuable for both your learning and for demonstrating your iterative process to potential employers. It connects directly to the file management practices essential for professional designers.\n\n## Over to You\n\nReview your most recent design project. Which of these templates would have most improved your feedback collection process? How might implementing structured feedback change your approach to revision cycles?\n\nFor your next assignment, select one of these templates and apply it to gather feedback on a current project. Be prepared to share how the structured approach affected both your design process and final outcome.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n\n* Removed the word \"module\" from the introduction and rephrased to focus directly on the content\n* Simplified the introduction paragraph to improve readability while maintaining the professional context\n* Removed the reference to \"we've discussed\" in Template 4's professional workflow section to avoid self-referencing\n* Maintained all practical examples and templates which are essential for these hands-on visual learners\n* Preserved the \"Over to You\" section which supports the learner's need for practical application and community building",
