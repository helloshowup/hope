Having established the foundation for our cross-generational financial application, we're now ready to explore advanced prototyping techniques that ensure our designs work seamlessly across different devices and user groups. This builds directly on your initial wireframes and research, transforming conceptual ideas into functional, inclusive prototypes that address real user needs\u2014skills that will significantly enhance your professional portfolio.\n\n## Creating Responsive Components in Figma\n\nResponsive design is essential when creating financial interfaces that must function across smartphones, tablets, and desktops while serving diverse user groups. Mastering these techniques will demonstrate your technical proficiency to potential employers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Component Creation\n\n1. **Set up your responsive frames**\n   Begin by creating frames for each device size (mobile, tablet, desktop). Use Figma's frame presets to ensure industry-standard dimensions.\n   \n   ![Example of responsive frames setup in Figma showing mobile, tablet and desktop layouts side by side](placeholder-image-responsive-frames.jpg)\n\n2. **Establish component variants**\n   For key elements like navigation bars and transaction cards:\n   * Create a base component\n   * Add properties for different states (default, hover, active)\n   * Add responsive variants using the Properties panel\n   * Document accessibility considerations for each variant\n\n   > **Example:** For a transaction history card, create variants that display differently on mobile (compact view) versus desktop (expanded view), while maintaining consistent information hierarchy that works for both younger and older users.\n\n3. **Implement auto-layout for flexibility**\n   Apply auto-layout to components to ensure they respond appropriately when content changes or when viewed on different devices.\n   \n   ![Animation showing how auto-layout adjusts components when content changes](placeholder-image-autolayout.jpg)\n\n## Cross-Device Navigation Patterns\n\nNavigation is particularly challenging in financial apps where users need to access critical information quickly regardless of their device or technical comfort level.\n\n### Implementation Process\n\n1. **Map user journeys across devices**\n   Document how users might start a task on one device and complete it on another. This demonstrates your understanding of real-world user behavior.\n   \n   ![User journey map showing cross-device interaction flow](placeholder-image-user-journey.jpg)\n\n2. **Create consistent navigation landmarks**\n   Design navigation elements that maintain consistent positioning and functionality across devices while adapting to different screen sizes:\n   \n   * **Mobile:** Prioritize bottom navigation for thumb-friendly access to primary functions\n   * **Tablet:** Implement a hybrid approach with collapsible side navigation\n   * **Desktop:** Utilize expanded horizontal navigation with dropdown menus\n\n3. **Implement progressive disclosure**\n   Use this technique to simplify complex financial information:\n   * Show essential information first\n   * Allow users to expand for more details\n   * Consider how this serves both tech-savvy users and those who prefer simpler interfaces\n\n## Accessible Design System Development\n\nBuilding on our initial accessibility considerations, we'll now formalize these into a comprehensive design system\u2014an essential skill for professional graphic designers.\n\n### Key Components\n\n* **Color contrast verification** - Document WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all text elements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)\n* **Typography scaling** - Implement a responsive type system that maintains readability across devices\n* **Focus states** - Create clear visual indicators for keyboard navigation\n* **Touch targets** - Size appropriately for users with varying dexterity (minimum 44\u00d744px)\n* **Alternative text** - Include fields for descriptive text in your component documentation\n\n![Example of accessibility documentation in a design system](placeholder-image-accessibility.jpg)\n\n## Documenting Your Process\n\nProfessional designers document their process thoroughly\u2014a practice that will strengthen your portfolio:\n\n1. Create a systematic approach to versioning your designs\n2. Document specific changes made in response to user feedback\n3. Maintain a decision log explaining the rationale behind major design changes\n4. Use Figma comments to track ongoing discussions about specific elements\n\n## Over to You\n\nBefore our next session, experiment with creating a responsive transaction card component that works across three device sizes. Consider:\n\n1. How does information hierarchy change between devices?\n2. What accessibility features are essential for financial information?\n3. How might you accommodate both younger users who want data visualization and older users who might prefer tabular information?\n\nDocument your process and decisions\u2014this documentation will form a valuable addition to your professional portfolio, demonstrating both your technical skills and your thoughtful approach to inclusive design.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nNext, we'll explore \"Financial App Design System Templates,\" where you'll receive practical resources to implement these concepts systematically, including component libraries and accessibility checklists that will help you create comprehensive design systems for your own financial interface projects.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n\n* Removed the word \"module\" when self-referencing to make the content feel more conversational and less like a formal course structure\n* Simplified the introduction and conclusion sections to be more direct and action-oriented\n* Maintained the practical, hands-on approach that aligns with the learner profile's preference for visual and practical learning\n* Preserved all the technical content and portfolio-building elements that are crucial for the target learner's professional development",
