    "# Design Feedback Collection Templates\n\n## Introduction to Design Feedback Systems\n\nEffective feedback collection is the cornerstone of successful design projects. As you transition from individual designers to collaborative team members, understanding how to systematically gather, analyze, and implement feedback becomes essential to your professional practice. This module explores practical templates for design feedback collection that bridge the gap between working independently and thriving in collaborative environments.\n\n## Template 1: Visual Annotation Feedback Form\n\nThis template allows stakeholders to provide specific comments directly on design elements:\n\n```\nDesign Element | Feedback Type | Comment | Priority (1-5) | Action Required\n---------------|--------------|---------|----------------|----------------\nHeader         | Visual       | \"Color contrast needs improvement\" | 4 | Adjust color palette\nNavigation     | Functional   | \"Menu items overlap on mobile\" | 5 | Redesign mobile menu\n```\n\n**Real-world application:** When working on team projects, this structured format ensures feedback is actionable rather than vague. It transforms comments like \"I don't like the header\" into specific insights the entire team can address.\n\n## Template 2: User Experience Survey\n\nThis template helps collect quantitative data about user interactions:\n\n```\nQuestion | Rating Scale (1-5) | Open Response\n---------|-------------------|---------------\nHow easy was it to complete the primary task? | \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 | Why did you give this rating?\nHow visually appealing did you find the design? | \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 | What elements stood out to you?\nHow well did the design meet your expectations? | \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 | What would improve your experience?\n```\n\n**Team application:** Sharing survey results creates a common understanding of user needs among team members, reducing subjective opinions in favor of data-driven decisions.\n\n## Template 3: Stakeholder Feedback Matrix\n\nThis template helps prioritize feedback from different stakeholders:\n\n```\nStakeholder | Feedback | Business Impact (1-5) | Technical Feasibility (1-5) | Implementation Priority\n------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------\nClient      | \"Need stronger brand presence\" | 5 | 3 | High\nUsers       | \"Navigation is confusing\" | 4 | 4 | High\nMarketing   | \"Add social sharing options\" | 3 | 5 | Medium\n```\n\n**Collaborative value:** This template transforms individual feedback collection into a team decision-making tool, ensuring everyone understands not just what changes are needed but why they're prioritized in a certain way.\n\n## Template 4: Iterative Design Feedback Tracker\n\nThis template documents feedback across multiple design iterations:\n\n```\nDesign Version | Feedback Received | Changes Implemented | Remaining Issues | Team Member Responsible\n---------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------\nV1.0           | \"Text illegible on mobile\" | Increased font size | Spacing issues | Alex\nV1.1           | \"Better, but menu still problematic\" | Redesigned navigation | None | Jordan\n```\n\n**Team benefit:** This creates a shared history of the design evolution, helping new team members understand past decisions and preventing the same issues from recurring.\n\n## Over to You\n\nThink about a recent design project you completed. Which of these templates would have most improved your feedback collection process? How might structured feedback collection change your approach to revision cycles?\n\nRemember, as you prepare for the upcoming sustainable fashion brand campaign project, these templates will be essential for managing feedback across multiple platforms and stakeholders.",
    "# Design Feedback Collection Templates\n\n## Introduction to Design Feedback Tools\n\nAs you progress in your graphic design career, collecting and analyzing feedback becomes essential to your professional practice. The ability to systematically gather, organize, and implement feedback separates novice designers from seasoned professionals. In this section, we'll explore practical templates for collecting design feedback that will help you transition from working individually to collaborating effectively within design teams.\n\n## Key Feedback Collection Templates\n\n### 1. Visual Annotation Template\n\nThis template allows stakeholders to provide specific feedback directly on your design:\n\n```\nDesign Element | Feedback | Priority (1-5) | Rationale\n---------------|----------|----------------|----------\nColor scheme   |          |                |\nTypography     |          |                |\nLayout         |          |                |\nImagery        |          |                |\n```\n\nThis structured approach helps organize feedback by design element, making implementation more systematic. Remember how we discussed design principles in your first year? This template connects directly to those foundational elements.\n\n### 2. User Experience Questionnaire\n\nFor gathering quantitative feedback on user experience:\n\n```\nOn a scale of 1-5 (1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree):\n\n- The design clearly communicates its intended message\n- Navigation is intuitive and easy to follow\n- Visual hierarchy effectively guides attention\n- The design evokes the intended emotional response\n- I understand what action I'm expected to take\n\nAdditional comments: _______________________\n```\n\nThis template helps quantify subjective responses, creating measurable data points for analysis\u2014a critical skill as you prepare for the upcoming sustainable fashion brand project.\n\n### 3. Collaborative Feedback Matrix\n\nThis team-oriented template facilitates group feedback sessions:\n\n```\n            | Strengths | Weaknesses | Opportunities | Threats\n------------|-----------|------------|--------------|--------\nTeam Member 1|           |            |              |\nTeam Member 2|           |            |              |\nTeam Member 3|           |            |              |\nConsensus   |           |            |              |\n```\n\nThis SWOT-based approach encourages diverse perspectives while building toward team consensus\u2014essential for collaborative projects in your professional future.\n\n### 4. Implementation Tracker\n\nThis template helps bridge feedback and action:\n\n```\nFeedback Item | Source | Priority | Implementation Plan | Status | Completion Date\n--------------|--------|----------|---------------------|--------|----------------\n              |        |          |                     |        |\n```\n\nThis tracker transforms feedback into actionable tasks with clear ownership and timelines, addressing a common challenge in professional practice: turning critique into improvement.\n\n## From Individual to Collaborative Design\n\nNotice how these templates progressively shift from individual feedback collection to collaborative evaluation. This mirrors your professional development journey from solo designer to team contributor. Effective teams understand that feedback isn't personal criticism but a collective resource for improvement.\n\n## Over to You\n\nConsider a recent design project you've completed. Which of these templates would have been most valuable for collecting feedback? How might structured feedback have changed your final design?\n\nIn the upcoming sustainable fashion brand project, you'll apply these templates across multiple platforms, creating a comprehensive feedback ecosystem that informs design decisions throughout the campaign development process.",
    "# Design Feedback Collection Templates and Tools\n\n## Introduction: The Power of Structured Feedback\n\nAs you transition from individual design practice to professional collaborative environments, your ability to collect, analyze, and implement feedback becomes increasingly valuable. Structured feedback collection isn't just about gathering opinions\u2014it's about creating systems that yield actionable insights to improve your design work. This module explores practical templates for design feedback that bridge individual creative processes with team-based workflows.\n\n## Key Feedback Collection Templates\n\n### 1. Visual Annotation Templates\n\nVisual annotation tools allow direct commenting on design elements, creating a visual conversation around specific components. These templates include:\n\n- **Hotspot Feedback Forms**: Interactive templates where reviewers can click directly on design elements to leave comments\n- **Comparison Grids**: Side-by-side layouts allowing stakeholders to evaluate design iterations with structured response fields\n- **Element-Specific Questionnaires**: Forms targeting feedback on specific design components (typography, color, layout, etc.)\n\n### 2. User Experience Feedback Frameworks\n\nThese templates help gather insights about how users interact with and respond to designs:\n\n- **Emotional Response Scales**: Templates capturing user emotional reactions using visual scales (from negative to positive)\n- **Task Completion Assessments**: Structured forms evaluating how easily users accomplish specific goals with your design\n- **Preference Testing Templates**: A/B comparison frameworks where users indicate preferences between design options\n\n### 3. Collaborative Review Templates\n\nThese templates facilitate team-based feedback sessions:\n\n- **Design Critique Worksheets**: Structured documents guiding team members through constructive critique processes\n- **Stakeholder Priority Matrices**: Templates for weighing different stakeholder feedback based on project priorities\n- **Feedback Synthesis Forms**: Documents for consolidating multiple feedback sources into actionable revisions\n\n### 4. Implementation Planning Templates\n\nThese help translate feedback into concrete design improvements:\n\n- **Feedback Action Plans**: Templates organizing feedback points into prioritized action items\n- **Revision Tracking Documents**: Forms documenting design changes made in response to specific feedback\n- **Feedback Implementation Timelines**: Templates for scheduling feedback-driven revisions within project timelines\n\n## From Individual to Collaborative Feedback\n\nThe transition from working individually to collaborating effectively within a team requires a shift in how you approach feedback:\n\n**Individual Approach**: When working solo, you might collect feedback informally and implement changes based on personal judgment.\n\n**Collaborative Approach**: In team environments, feedback becomes a shared responsibility requiring:\n- Transparent documentation accessible to all team members\n- Clear ownership of feedback implementation\n- Consistent evaluation criteria across team members\n- Regular feedback review sessions\n\n## Over to You\n\nThink about a recent design project you completed individually. How might you adapt one of these feedback templates to improve your process? Now imagine the same project in a team context\u2014what additional feedback structures would you need to implement for effective collaboration?\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nIn our next module, we'll apply these feedback frameworks to a real-world case study: developing a multi-platform campaign for a sustainable fashion brand. You'll see how these templates function across different touchpoints and stakeholder groups in a complex commercial project."
