As you transition from your first year of design studies into more professional work, you'll discover that successful projects require navigating a complex network of people with different needs, expectations and levels of influence.\n\nStakeholder mapping builds on the problem-framing tools you've already explored (mind mapping and SWOT analysis) by providing a visual framework to identify, organise and understand the people connected to your design projects. This visual approach helps ensure all voices are considered and prevents unexpected roadblocks that could derail your timeline or compromise your solution.\n\n## What is Stakeholder Mapping?\n\nStakeholder mapping is a visual technique that identifies all parties involved in or affected by your design project and illustrates their relationships, influence levels and interests. Unlike mind maps that focus on ideas and concepts, stakeholder maps specifically visualise the human ecosystem surrounding your work.\n\n![Example stakeholder map showing connections between client, design team, end users, and other stakeholders](stakeholder_map_example.jpg)\n\n*A stakeholder map visualises the relationships between all parties involved in a design project, helping you manage expectations and communication.*\n\n## The Stakeholder Mapping Process\n\n### Step 1: Identify Your Stakeholders\n\nStart by brainstorming everyone who might be affected by or have influence over your design project:\n\n* **Primary stakeholders:** Those directly affected (clients, end users, your design team)\n* **Secondary stakeholders:** Those indirectly affected (printers, developers, marketing teams)\n* **Key stakeholders:** Those with significant decision-making power (project sponsors, department heads)\n\n**Over to You:** Think about a current or recent design project and list all possible stakeholders. Did you initially overlook any important groups? How might including these overlooked stakeholders have changed your approach?\n\n### Step 2: Analyse Stakeholder Relationships\n\nOnce identified, analyse how stakeholders relate to:\n* The project itself\n* Each other\n* Your design team\n\n**Visual Technique:** Create a diagram using different line styles to indicate:\n* Strong connections (solid lines)\n* Weak connections (dotted lines)\n* Potential conflicts (zigzag lines)\n* Direction of influence (arrows)\n* Line thickness to show strength of relationship\n\nThis visualisation builds upon your mind mapping skills but focuses specifically on relationships rather than concepts.\n\n### Step 3: Document Stakeholder Requirements\n\nFor each stakeholder, document:\n* Their specific needs and expectations from the project\n* Success criteria from their perspective\n* Potential concerns or resistance points\n* Communication preferences and frequency\n* Level of involvement required\n\n**Pro Tip:** Create requirement cards for each stakeholder with colour-coding to indicate priority level. These make brilliant additions to your portfolio as they demonstrate your professional approach to client management \u2013 something employers are always looking for.\n\n### Step 4: Define Roles and Responsibilities\n\nClearly outline who is responsible for what within the project:\n* Decision-makers (who has final approval)\n* Advisors (who provides input)\n* Implementers (who executes different aspects)\n* End users (who ultimately uses the design)\n\nA RACI chart (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is particularly useful here and builds on the organisational frameworks you've practised in your SWOT analyses.\n\n## Common Stakeholder Mapping Methods\n\n1. **Influence/Interest Grid:** Position stakeholders on a quadrant based on their level of influence and interest in your project. We'll explore this method in more detail in the next section.\n\n2. **Onion Diagram:** Visualise stakeholders in concentric circles with the most important in the centre.\n\n3. **Stakeholder Rainbow:** Arrange stakeholders by category (users, clients, team members) in a semi-circular arrangement.\n\n## Practical Application\n\nLet's say you're working on a website redesign for a local coffee shop. Your stakeholder map might include:\n* Shop owner (primary decision-maker)\n* Shop staff (daily users of the system)\n* Customers (different demographic groups)\n* Social media manager\n* Local suppliers featured on the site\n* Web developer\n\nEach has different priorities that must be balanced in your design solution. The owner might care about brand image and cost, while staff focus on ease of updating menus, and customers just want to check opening hours quickly on their phones.\n\nBy mapping these relationships visually, you can spot potential conflicts early \u2013 like when the owner wants elaborate animations that the developer says will slow down the site \u2013 and develop strategies to address them before they become problems.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nIn the next section, we'll explore specific analytical tools like the Power/Interest grid to further refine your understanding of stakeholder dynamics. You'll also learn effective stakeholder interview techniques that will help you gather requirements more efficiently and build stronger client relationships \u2013 essential skills for your professional portfolio.\n\n## Summary\n\nStakeholder mapping transforms complex project relationships into visual representations that help you navigate the human elements of design work. By clearly documenting who's involved, what they need, and how they relate to one another, you create a valuable reference that will guide your decision-making throughout the design process. This professional approach to project management will distinguish your work in the industry and help you deliver more successful design solutions that clients love.",
