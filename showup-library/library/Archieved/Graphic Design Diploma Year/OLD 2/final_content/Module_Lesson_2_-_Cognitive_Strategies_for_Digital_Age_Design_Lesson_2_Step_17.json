  "final_content": "# Building Your Banking App Design System: Professional Templates & Resources\n\nReady to move from theory to practice? Now that you've explored cross-platform prototyping for financial interfaces, it's time to implement your banking app design system using professional resources. This section provides practical templates and tools to help you develop consistent, accessible financial interfaces\u2014skills that will showcase your technical abilities and attention to detail as you prepare for your graphic design career.\n\n## Component Library Template for Financial App Interfaces\n\nA structured component library ensures consistency throughout your banking app. Your financial component library should include:\n\n- **Primary UI Elements**: Buttons, form fields, and toggles with finance-specific states\n- **Navigation Components**: Tab bars, breadcrumbs, and menus optimised for banking workflows\n- **Content Modules**: Account summaries, transaction lists, and data visualisation components\n\n**Example Application**: When designing a \"Quick Transfer\" feature, you'll combine several components\u2014input fields, dropdown selectors, and confirmation buttons\u2014each maintaining visual consistency while adapting to different contexts.\n\n![Component library example showing banking UI elements in various states](placeholder-image)\n\n> **Over to You**: Examine three different banking apps and identify their core components. How do these components adapt across different screen sizes? Create a simple sketch showing how you would organise these components in your own library.\n\n## Responsive Grid System for Cross-Device Layouts\n\nYour banking app must function seamlessly across devices, requiring a thoughtful responsive grid:\n\n1. **Desktop (12-column)**: Prioritises comprehensive information and complex interactions\n2. **Tablet (8-column)**: Balances information density with touch-friendly interfaces\n3. **Mobile (4-column)**: Focuses on essential functions with simplified navigation\n\n**Implementation Technique**: Set up a Figma file with frames preset to your grid specifications, allowing you to quickly test how components reflow across breakpoints.\n\n![Responsive grid demonstration showing banking interface across three device sizes](placeholder-image)\n\n## User Testing Documentation Templates\n\nProfessional designers document user testing thoroughly. These templates structure this process:\n\n- **Test Plan Template**: Define objectives, participant profiles, and testing scenarios\n- **Observation Form**: Record user interactions, completion rates, and pain points\n- **Findings Summary**: Standardise how insights are communicated to stakeholders\n\n**Real-World Application**: These documentation practices reflect industry standards you'll encounter when presenting to clients and collaborating with teams in your future career.\n\n## Accessibility Checklist for Financial Interfaces\n\nFinancial applications must be accessible to all users\u2014a critical consideration for portfolio work:\n\n- **Visual Design**: Colour contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1), text scaling without breaking layouts\n- **Interaction Design**: Touch targets (minimum 44\u00d744px), keyboard navigation paths\n- **Content Design**: Clear error messages, screen reader compatibility\n\n**Professional Context**: Demonstrating accessibility awareness in your portfolio will set you apart as a designer who understands inclusive design\u2014increasingly valued by employers and clients alike.\n\n![Accessibility visualisation showing contrast checking and touch target sizing](placeholder-image)\n\n## Design System Documentation Template\n\nGood documentation ensures your design system remains usable and maintainable:\n\n1. **Component Specifications**: Dimensions, spacing, behaviours across breakpoints\n2. **Usage Guidelines**: When and how to implement each component\n3. **Technical Specifications**: Information needed for developer handoff\n4. **Version History**: Tracking changes and updates to your system\n\n**Portfolio Opportunity**: Well-documented design systems highlight your technical precision and communication skills\u2014qualities employers actively seek in graphic design graduates.\n\n## Conclusion: Preparing for Version Control\n\nThese templates provide the foundation for implementing your banking app design system. Next, we'll cover Design Version Control and Documentation, where you'll learn to manage design assets through structured iteration, enabling you to track changes professionally as your banking app evolves.\n\nRemember: These aren't just academic exercises\u2014they're professional tools that will help you build an industry-ready portfolio demonstrating your technical skills and systematic approach to design.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Banking App Component Library Examples](placeholder-link)\n- [Responsive Grid Templates for Figma](placeholder-link)\n- [Accessibility Testing Tools for Designers](placeholder-link)\n- [Design System Documentation Examples](placeholder-link)",
  "editing_explanation": "I've made several changes to make this content more human-like and appropriate for HND Graphic Design students:\n\n1. Removed the formal \"Introduction\" heading and replaced the generic opening with a more engaging, conversational hook\n2. Reduced overly formal academic language while maintaining professional tone\n3. Added more practical, industry-relevant examples and context\n4. Varied sentence structure and length to create a more natural flow\n5. Incorporated more direct address to the reader to create engagement\n6. Changed American spellings to British (colour, organise, etc.)\n7. Ensured the reflection section is properly labeled as \"Over to You\"\n8. Added more specific, tangible examples that connect to portfolio development\n9. Reduced repetitive phrasing and AI-like sentence structures\n10. Made the content more concise while preserving all key information",
