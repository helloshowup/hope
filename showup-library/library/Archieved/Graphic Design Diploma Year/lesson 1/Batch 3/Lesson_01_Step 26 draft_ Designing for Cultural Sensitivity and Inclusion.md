# **Lesson 1 Step 26 draft: Designing for Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusion**

This lesson explores the challenges and opportunities of designing across cultural contexts. In our interconnected world, visual communications frequently cross cultural boundaries—sometimes intentionally, sometimes unexpectedly. Developing cultural awareness in your design practice isn't just ethically important; it's a professional necessity that makes your persuasive work more effective.

## **Beyond Basic Cultural Awareness**

### **Navigating Complex Cultural Terrain**

Cultural sensitivity requires more than avoiding obvious stereotypes or offensive imagery. Today's designers need to understand the layered complexity of cultural identities:

**Subcultures Within Dominant Cultures** create nuanced interpretations of visual elements. The Global Visual Communication Institute found that urban and rural populations within the same country can interpret visual metaphors up to 40% differently. When designing for markets like India or China, recognizing these internal variations helps avoid overgeneralizing about "national" visual preferences.

\[Image: Comparison of color preference charts across generations in Chinese markets. Caption: "Fig 12: Research visualization from Chen et al. (2023) showing generational shifts in colour associations among Chinese consumers"\]

**Generational Cultural Shifts** further complicate cultural understanding. Research by Chen et al. (2023) found that colour associations among Gen Z Chinese consumers differ significantly from older generations. Traditional red and gold associations remain strong for ceremonial contexts but have weakened for everyday commercial applications, where younger audiences show preferences more aligned with global trends.

When developing designs for international audiences, consider how multiple cultural factors—region, generation, socioeconomic background, and more—might influence how people interpret your visual elements.

## **The Cultural Representation Depth Model**

Moving beyond surface-level cultural representation requires a structured approach. The Cultural Representation Depth Model offers a framework for evaluating and improving cultural authenticity in your designs:

\[Image: Four-level pyramid diagram of cultural representation depth. Caption: "Fig 13: The Cultural Representation Depth Model showing progression from surface representation to transformative representation"\]

**Level 1: Surface Representation** involves visual inclusion without meaningful context. While it may achieve visual diversity, it rarely creates authentic cultural connection. Audiences increasingly recognize this approach as tokenistic—including diverse faces without deeper cultural understanding.

**Level 2: Informed Representation** builds on research-based depiction of cultural elements. Airbnb's "Made Possible By Hosts" campaign went beyond mere visual diversity by researching specific cultural contexts in each market before developing visual stories.

**Level 3: Collaborative Representation** employs co-creation with community members. This approach brings authentic voices into the design process itself, rather than designing *for* a culture based only on external research.

**Level 4: Transformative Representation** challenges stereotypes while authentically representing culture. This highest level not only depicts cultures accurately but contributes to evolving understanding and appreciation of diverse cultural perspectives.

When evaluating your own work, ask: At which level of the Cultural Representation Depth Model does my design operate? What would be required to move it to a deeper level of authenticity?

## **Polycentric Design: Adapting Across Cultural Contexts**

### **Beyond Simple Translation**

Traditional approaches to cross-cultural design often start with a design created for one culture, then adapt for others. Polycentric design takes a more sophisticated approach:

\[Image: Samsung interface design process showing multiple cultural origin points. Caption: "Fig 14: Samsung's polycentric design approach showing how interface elements originate from multiple cultural perspectives rather than being adapted from a single source"\]

**Cultural Origin-Shifting** designs from multiple cultural perspectives rather than adapting from a single cultural origin point. Samsung's approach to interface design shows this in action. Rather than creating a "Western" interface and adapting it for Asian markets, they maintain design teams in multiple regions, each developing original concepts that inform their global design language.

\[Image: Spectrum mapping of colour meanings across cultural contexts. Caption: "Fig 15: Cultural spectrum mapping for colour meanings, showing how red signifies different things across a continuum of cultural contexts"\]

**Cultural Spectrum Mapping** evaluates design elements across cultural continuums rather than simple categories. Instead of simply labeling colour meanings as "Western" or "Eastern," designers can map meanings across a spectrum of cultural contexts, identifying both similarities and differences.

When adapting your designs across cultural contexts, consider:

Which design elements are truly universal and which require cultural adaptation? Can you incorporate cultural perspectives from the beginning rather than as an afterthought? How might different cultural audiences interpret not just the obvious elements (text, images) but also more subtle components like composition, white space, and rhythm?

## **Case Study: Financial App Redesign**

\[Image: Four interface versions of a financial app adapted for different markets. Caption: "Fig 16: Financial app interfaces optimized for UAE, Japan, Brazil, and Kenya markets, showing cultural adaptations of the same core functionality"\]

A financial services app redesign for simultaneous launch in the UAE, Japan, Brazil, and Kenya demonstrates how cultural sensitivity transforms practical design decisions:

**Research revealed distinct patterns**: UAE users preferred familial financial metaphors rather than individual growth narratives. Japanese users showed a strong preference for data density (78%) compared to Kenyan users (23%). Brazilian users prioritized social financial features absent in other markets.

**The design response** maintained core functionality while adapting:

Visual metaphors and iconography (family-oriented in UAE, individual achievement in Western markets), information density (higher in Japan, lower in Kenya), colour systems for financial indicators (red indicating positive performance in some markets, negative in others), and navigation patterns reflecting cultural reading patterns all needed adjustment.

**Results showed 40-65% higher adoption rates** compared to the previous one-size-fits-all approach, demonstrating the business value of cultural adaptation beyond ethical considerations.

## **Research Methodologies for Cultural Understanding**

Designing with cultural sensitivity requires substantive research. Several approaches particularly suit designers' needs:

**Cultural Probes** provide a structured way to gather cultural insights directly from target audiences. These research kits contain creative tasks that help participants document their cultural contexts and associations. For graphic designers, these might include visual association exercises, colour preference studies, or metaphor mapping.

**Visual Preference Testing** allows designers to test specific elements across cultural groups. Rather than making assumptions about how colours, compositions, or imagery might be perceived, this approach gathers real data about preferences and interpretations.

Before beginning cross-cultural design projects, consider what research approaches might best inform your work. Even time-limited projects benefit from targeted cultural research that prevents costly missteps.

### Try This when analyzing your next cross-cultural project:

After completing the adaptation exercise, consider:

Which elements were most challenging to adapt across cultural contexts? What surprised you most about the cultural research you conducted? How might your design process change for future projects to accommodate cultural considerations from the beginning? What visual elements proved most versatile across different cultural contexts?
