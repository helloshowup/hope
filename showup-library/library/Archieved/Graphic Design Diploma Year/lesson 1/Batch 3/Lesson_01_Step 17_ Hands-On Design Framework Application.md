# **Lesson 1 Step 17: Hands-On Design Framework Application**

These practical resources provide frameworks to test, evaluate, and improve your persuasive designs. Each worksheet guides you through structured processes to ensure your designs communicate effectively with your target audience and achieve their intended goals.

## **How to Use These Resources**

Download each PDF and integrate these frameworks into your design evaluation process. Start with the testing workbook to identify how effectively your designs persuade viewers, then use the evaluation matrix to systematically assess different aspects of your design's persuasive elements.

These worksheets work best when used as part of your regular design process—complete them digitally or print them for hands-on use. They connect together as part of a design quality assurance process rather than standing as separate assignments.

## **Available Design Frameworks**

A decision-making tool to prioritize design improvements based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them.

**PDF 4: Advertisement Analysis Matrix**

A structured framework to analyze existing advertisements and extract valuable insights about their visual elements and persuasive techniques.

**PDF 5: Sample Impact-Effort Matrix (Completed Example)**

See how to effectively use the Impact-Effort Matrix with a real-world example that demonstrates proper completion and analysis.

**PDF 6: Sample Advertisement Analysis (Completed Example)**

Learn how to analyze advertisements effectively with this detailed example showing how to identify and evaluate visual elements and persuasive strategies.

## **A Note on the Application Process**

These tools help graphic design students apply persuasive principles systematically. While they provide structured approaches to testing and evaluating designs, remember that creative design rarely follows a strictly linear path.

Feel free to adapt these frameworks to your specific project needs. The goal isn't just to complete worksheets—it's to develop a systematic approach to design evaluation that ensures your work achieves its persuasive objectives.

# **PDF 1: Persuasive Design Testing Workbook**

This workbook offers straightforward exercises to help you understand how your designs influence people. You don't need special equipment or large groups of participants – these activities can be completed with just a few classmates or friends. Each exercise will help you identify what's working and what could be improved in your persuasive designs.

## **Exercise 1: First Impression Test**

**Try This when gathering initial feedback on your design:**

**Purpose:** Discover what people notice first and what they miss in your design.

**Materials:**

* Your design (digital or printed)  
* 3-5 friends or classmates  
* Coloured pens or sticky notes (3 colours)  
* Timer

**Process:**

1. Show each person your design for exactly 3 seconds (Quick View)
2. Ask them to mark with RED what they noticed first
3. Ask them to mark with BLUE what they remember seeing
4. Ask them to mark with GREEN what they didn't notice until asked

**Documentation Template:**

| Element | % Noticed First | % Remembered | % Not Noticed | Priority for Revision |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Headline |  |  |  |  |
| Main image |  |  |  |  |
| Call to action |  |  |  |  |
| Logo |  |  |  |  |
| Supporting text |  |  |  |  |

**Analysis Questions:**
* Does your intended focal point match what viewers notice first?  
* Are critical persuasive elements being overlooked?  
* What elements compete for attention unnecessarily?

Document your findings and identify one element to prioritize for immediate revision.

## **Exercise 2: Design Journey Mapping**

**Try This during your design refinement phase:**

**Purpose:** Trace how people's eyes move through your design and identify where they lose interest.

**Materials:**

* Your design  
* 2-3 people  
* Paper for notes

**Process:**

1. Ask people to point to elements in the order they look at them
2. Have them rate how interesting each part is (1-5 scale)
3. Ask where they would either take action or lose interest

**Journey Map:**

```
[START] → Element: __________ →  Interest Level (1-5): __ → Continue? Y/N
        → Element: __________ →  Interest Level (1-5): __ → Continue? Y/N
        → Element: __________ →  Interest Level (1-5): __ → Continue? Y/N
        → [DECISION POINT] → Action taken: __________________
```

**Optimization Questions:**
* Where do viewers commonly exit before completing the desired action?  
* Which elements have the highest and lowest interest ratings?  
* How can you strengthen weak links in the viewer's journey?

Compare multiple journey maps to identify patterns in how viewers navigate your design.

## **Exercise 3: Action Trigger Analysis**

**Try This when you need to increase conversion rates:**

**Purpose:** Identify which parts of your design make people want to take action.

**Materials:**

* Your design  
* An alternative version of your design (or a competitor's design)  
* Simple recording sheet  
* 3-5 people

**Process:**

1. Show both designs
2. Ask: "Which design makes you more likely to [desired action]?"
3. Follow up: "What specific element influenced your decision most?"
4. Ask: "Why did this part stand out to you?"

**Action Element Tracker:**

| Design Element | Times Identified as Key Motivator | Comments | Persuasion Technique |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

**Link to Theory:**

For each identified motivating element, note which persuasion principle it employs:
* Reciprocity: Giving something to get something in return
* Commitment/Consistency: People want to be consistent with prior actions
* Social Proof: People follow what others do
* Authority: People respect expertise and authority
* Liking: People say yes to those they like
* Scarcity: People want what's rare or limited
* Unity: People identify with groups they belong to

Highlight the most effective persuasion principle and brainstorm ways to strengthen it further.

## **Exercise 4: Emotional Response Assessment**

**Try This to understand the psychological impact of your design:**

**Purpose:** Understand how your design makes people feel.

**Materials:**

* Your design (divided into 3-5 main areas)  
* List of basic emotions (happy, sad, confused, excited, calm, etc.)  
* Simple response sheet  
* 2-4 people

**Process:**

1. Identify 3-5 key areas of your design
2. Ask people what feeling each area gives them
3. Rate intensity of emotion (1-5)
4. Note if this emotion supports or hinders persuasive goal

**Emotional Impact Worksheet:**

| Design Area | Dominant Emotion | Intensity (1-5) | Supports Goal? (Y/N) | Suggested Revision |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. |  |  |  |  |
| 2\. |  |  |  |  |
| 3\. |  |  |  |  |

**Feeling Check:**
* Are the emotions evoked aligned with your persuasive intent?  
* Which areas create emotional disconnects?  
* How can emotional transitions be smoothed between elements?

Create a simple emotional journey map showing how feelings evolve across your design.

## **Implementation Guide**

For maximum effectiveness, follow this testing order:

1. Start with the First Impression Test to identify baseline visibility issues  
2. Apply initial corrections, then conduct Design Journey Mapping  
3. Refine flow issues, then perform Action Trigger Analysis  
4. Make final adjustments, then verify with Emotional Response Assessment

## **Connection to Quality Assurance Framework**

These exercises establish the foundation for checking how well your designs work. Each exercise addresses specific aspects of persuasive effectiveness:

1. **First Impression Test** → Visibility & Initial Engagement  
2. **Design Journey** → Logical Flow & Comprehension  
3. **Action Trigger Analysis** → Action Motivation & Conversion  
4. **Emotion Assessment** → Psychological Engagement & Retention

By using these simple testing methods, you'll develop a reliable way to check if your designs are working, which you can use on all your future projects.
