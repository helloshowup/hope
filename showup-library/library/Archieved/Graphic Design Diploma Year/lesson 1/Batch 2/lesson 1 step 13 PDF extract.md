User Feedback Integration
Beyond standard user feedback methods, cognitive design employs specialised techniques that reveal the thinking behind user behaviors:
Card sorting with cognitive analysis: Building on the information architecture principles from your HNC studies, advanced card sorting reveals not just how users categorise information, but their underlying cognitive frameworks
Retrospective cognitive interviews: Unlike traditional think-aloud protocols (which can disrupt natural behavior), retrospective interviews have users review recordings of their own interactions and explain their thinking at key moments
Predictive error modeling: Rather than just documenting errors after they occur, cognitive analysis can predict where errors are likely based on cognitive principles, enabling proactive design improvements

Part 2 shows advanced cognitive pattern analysis identifying "ping-ponging" between elements (showing confusion) and "tunnel vision" areas (showing cognitive overload).
