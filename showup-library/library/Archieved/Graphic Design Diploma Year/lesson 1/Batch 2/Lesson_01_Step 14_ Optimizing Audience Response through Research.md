## **PDF 1: Decision tree for selecting appropriate research methods**

This decision tree guides you through selecting the most effective research method for your design project based on your specific needs, resources, and audience. Following the questions will help identify which approach will yield the most valuable insights.

### **Starting Point**

Begin by identifying your primary research objective:

**Are you trying to understand what your audience thinks and feels?**

(Qualitative research focuses on opinions, motivations, and emotional responses)

* If yes → Follow Path A (Qualitative Research)  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need measurable data to validate design decisions?**

(Quantitative research provides numerical data that can be analyzed statistically)

* If yes → Follow Path B (Quantitative Research)  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to observe how people interact with your design?**

(Observational research examines actual behavior rather than reported preferences)

* If yes → Follow Path C (Observational Research)  
* If no → Revisit your research needs

### **Path A: Qualitative Research Methods**

**Do you need in-depth understanding of motivations and attitudes?**

* If yes → Consider in-depth interviews or focus groups  
* If no → Continue

**Are you interested in emotional responses to visual elements?**

* If yes → Use visual response testing or projective techniques  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to understand how your audience categorises information?**

* If yes → Try card sorting exercises or cognitive mapping  
* If no → Consider contextual inquiry

### **Path B: Quantitative Research Methods**

**Do you need to compare different design approaches?**

* If yes → Implement A/B testing  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to collect feedback from a large audience?**

* If yes → Use online surveys with clear visual examples  
* If no → Continue

**Are you trying to understand user journeys through your design?**

* If yes → Apply digital analytics tracking  
* If no → Consider multivariate testing

### **Path C: Observational Research Methods**

**Can you observe users in their natural environment?**

* If yes → Use contextual inquiry or digital ethnography  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to track exactly what users look at?**

* If yes → Implement eye-tracking studies  
* If no → Continue

**Do you need to understand the physical interaction with your design?**

* If yes → Set up usability testing sessions  
* If no → Consider heat mapping for digital designs

### **Method Selection Considerations**

When finalising your research method, consider these practical factors:

**Time Available:**

Quick insights (1-2 days) work well with surveys and 5-second tests. Medium timeline projects (1-2 weeks) benefit from remote user testing and A/B testing. Extended studies (3+ weeks) allow for in-depth interviews and contextual inquiry.

**Budget Constraints:**

Low budget options include social media polls, guerrilla testing, and analytics review (essentially free). Medium budget allows for online user testing platforms and survey tools (typically subscription-based services). Higher budget enables eye-tracking studies and professional research recruitment (requiring specialist equipment or expertise).

**Research Expertise Required:**

Online surveys and feedback forms need minimal expertise. Usability testing and card sorting require moderate expertise. Focus groups and in-depth analysis of qualitative data demand significant expertise.

**Try This When Planning Your First Research Project: ** Map out your project timeline and available resources, then identify which research methods from the decision tree align with your constraints. Choose one primary method and one backup method to ensure flexibility. Combining complementary methods often yields the most comprehensive understanding of your audience.

## **PDF 2: Objective Mapping template**

### **Crafting Effective Research Objectives**

Effective design research begins with clear objectives. This template guides you through creating SMART research objectives that address specific knowledge gaps about your audience, helping you gather actionable insights that directly inform your design decisions.

### **The SMART Framework for Design Research**

Research objectives should be:

* **Specific**: Precisely defines what information you need  
* **Measurable**: Includes criteria to determine when the objective is met  
* **Achievable**: Realistic given your resources and constraints  
* **Relevant**: Directly connects to your design challenge  
* **Time-bound**: Sets a clear timeframe for completion

### **Objective Mapping Process**

#### **Step 1: Identify Knowledge Gaps**

What don't you know about your audience that impacts your design effectiveness? Consider:

Knowledge Gap 1: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"I don't know which visual styles resonate emotionally with my target audience."*

Knowledge Gap 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"I'm unsure how my audience processes the hierarchy of information in my layouts."*

Knowledge Gap 3: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"I don't understand which colour palettes create the intended emotional response."*

**Try This When Starting a New Client Project: ** Review the client brief and identify three specific knowledge gaps about their target audience. Focus on aspects that will directly impact your design decisions rather than general demographics. Addressing these gaps first will strengthen your design rationale and client presentations.

#### **Step 2: Transform Gaps into SMART Objectives**

For each knowledge gap identified, create a corresponding SMART objective:

##### **Objective 1:**

* Specific: What exactly do you need to learn? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Measurable: How will you know when you've succeeded? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Achievable: What methods will you use? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Relevant: How will this inform your design? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Time-bound: When will you complete this? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Complete Objective 1: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Example: *"Determine the top three visual styles that evoke trust among healthcare professionals aged 35-55 through a combination of visual preference testing and semi-structured interviews with 15 participants by March 15th."*

##### **Objective 2:**

* Specific: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Measurable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Achievable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Relevant: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Time-bound: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Complete Objective 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

##### **Objective 3:**

* Specific: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Measurable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Achievable: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Relevant: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
* Time-bound: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Complete Objective 3: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Try This When Feeling Overwhelmed by Research Options: ** Take your most important knowledge gap and craft just one complete SMART objective. Focus on making it highly specific and directly relevant to your current design challenge. Even one well-executed research objective can significantly improve your design outcomes.

#### **Step 3: Prioritization Matrix**

Use this table to prioritize which objectives to address first:

|  | Urgency (1-5) | Impact on Design (1-5) | Resource Requirements (1-5) | Total Score |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Objective 1 |  |  |  |  |
| Objective 2 |  |  |  |  |
| Objective 3 |  |  |  |  |

*Higher scores indicate higher priority. For Resource Requirements, higher scores indicate FEWER resources needed (easier to accomplish).*

#### **Step 4: Research Methods Selection**

Based on your objectives and the Decision Tree (PDF 1), which methods will you use for each objective?

Objective 1 Method(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Objective 2 Method(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Objective 3 Method(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Remember: Your research objectives directly inform which methods you select and how you'll implement them. Clear objectives lead to focused research that delivers actionable insights for your design process.

## **Over to you:**
How do your current research practices compare to the SMART framework outlined above? Think about a recent project and consider which aspects of your research approach could be strengthened to gather more actionable insights.
