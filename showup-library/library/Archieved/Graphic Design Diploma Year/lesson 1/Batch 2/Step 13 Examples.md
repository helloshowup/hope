This sample worksheet illustrates how a cognitive walkthrough can be used to analyse a common digital task like creating an account on a hypothetical e-commerce website. It tracks the expected user steps, anticipates potential user thought processes (both expected and actual), identifies cognitive barriers or friction points, and provides a hypothetical estimate of mental effort.

Note: This is a constructed example. The "Actual User Thoughts" and "Mental Effort" are hypothetical, representing potential issues a real walkthrough might uncover. Quantifying mental effort precisely is complex; a simple 1-5 scale (1=Low, 5=Very High) is used here for illustration. Areas needing attention due to high friction or potential barriers are marked with Highlight.

Cognitive Walkthrough Worksheet: E-commerce Account Creation

Evaluator: UX Analyst  
Date: 2025-04-10  
Product/Interface: Hypothetical E-commerce Website (Desktop)  
User Persona: Moderately tech-savvy adult user, new to this specific website.  
User Goal: Create a new user account to save items and speed up future checkout.

| Step \# | Action / Screen Description | Key Questions / Focus Area¹ | Expected User Thought Process | Potential Actual User Thought Process / Cognitive Barriers | Est. Mental Effort (1-5) | Notes / Suggestions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | User navigates to homepage, looks for account creation option. | Will the user know where to start? Will they notice the correct action (e.g., "Sign Up" / "Create Account" link)? | "I need to make an account. I'll look for 'Sign Up' or 'Account' usually in the top right corner." | "Where is the sign-up link? Is it 'My Account'? Or 'Login'? Oh, it's tiny text next to the cart icon." (Barrier: Link visibility/labelling unclear) | 2 | Increase visibility/size of "Create Account" link. Use standard placement (top right). Clearly differentiate from "Login". |
| 2 | Clicks "Create Account". Lands on registration form page. | Will the user understand the purpose of this page? | "Okay, this is the registration page. I need to fill this out." | "This looks straightforward." | 1 | Clear page title ("Create Your Account"). |
| 3 | Enters email address into the designated field. | Is the correct action obvious (enter email)? Is the field clearly labelled? | "First step, email address." | "Standard email field, easy." | 1 | Standard input field design. Clear label ("Email Address"). |
| 4 | Creates a password in the "Password" field. | Will the user understand password requirements? Is feedback provided on strength/requirements met? | "Need a strong password. Let me type one in." | "What are the requirements? It doesn't say. *Types password*. Okay, now it shows red text 'Must be 8+ chars, include number & symbol'. Why didn't it say before?" (Barrier: Requirements not shown upfront; reactive feedback only). High cognitive load trying to guess rules. | 4 | Highlight: Display password requirements *before* the user types or as they type. Use inline validation for clarity. Provide strength metre. |
| 5 | Re-enters password in the "Confirm Password" field. | Is the purpose of this field clear? Is feedback provided if passwords don't match? | "Need to type it again to make sure." | "Okay, re-type. *Mistypes*. It says 'Passwords do not match'. Good feedback." (Potential Barrier: Why is re-typing needed? Some sites skip this). | 2 | Consider adding an optional "Show Password" toggle to reduce errors and potentially remove the need for confirmation field (trade-off). Clear error message is good. |
| 6 | Fills in "First Name" and "Last Name" fields. | Are the fields clearly labelled and expected? | "Standard name fields." | "Easy enough." | 1 | Standard input fields. |
| 7 | Encounters optional "Date of Birth" field. | Is it clear this is optional? Will the user understand why it's being asked? | "My birthday? Why do they need this? Hmm, it doesn't say 'required'." | "Why do they need my birthday for shopping? Is it for a discount? Or data collection? It's not marked required, so I'll skip it." (Barrier: Lack of clarity on *why* optional data is requested, potential privacy concern/distrust). | 3 | Clearly label as "(Optional)". Provide a brief explanation via tooltip or microcopy (e.g., "For a birthday surprise\!"). |
| 8 | Encounters checkbox "Sign up for newsletter". Pre-checked. | Will the user notice the checkbox? Will they understand it's pre-checked? Will they associate it with receiving marketing emails? | "Newsletter checkbox... wait, it's already checked? I didn't ask for that." | "Sneaky\! They checked it for me. I don't want spam." *Unchecks*. (Barrier: Pre-checked box uses default bias/inertia deceptively \- potential dark pattern). User has to actively *opt-out*. | 3 | Highlight: Follow ethical design. Checkbox should be unchecked by default (opt-in). Clearly state what signing up entails. |
| 9 | Encounters checkbox "I agree to the Terms & Conditions". | Is the action clear (must check to proceed)? Is the link to T\&Cs obvious? | "Need to agree to the terms. Where are they? Okay, there's the link." | "Ugh, terms and conditions. *Clicks link*. Wow, that's long. *Closes link*. Fine, I'll just check the box." (Barrier: Users rarely read T\&Cs, but legally required. Cognitive friction acknowledging agreement without reading). | 2 | Ensure T\&Cs link is prominent and functional. Consider summarising key points if feasible, though legally complex. Required nature of checkbox is clear. |
| 10 | Clicks the "Create Account" submit button. | Is the button clearly visible and labelled? Will the user associate this button with completing the process? | "This should be the last step. Click 'Create Account'." | "Button is clear." | 1 | Prominent, clearly labelled submit button. |
| 11 | System processes and displays confirmation/welcome screen. | Will the user understand the feedback (account created successfully)? Is it clear what to do next (e.g., start shopping, check email for verification)? | "It worked\! Account created. Now what?" | "Success\! Says 'Welcome, \[Name\]\!' and 'Check your email to verify'. Okay, makes sense." (Potential Barrier: If next steps aren't clear, or if email verification is required *before* logging in). | 2 | Clear success message. Explicitly state next steps (e.g., "Start Shopping" button, clear instruction about email verification and its purpose/necessity). |

¹Key Questions Focus Area: Simplified representation of the core questions asked during a cognitive walkthrough, focusing on whether the user knows what to do, can see/find the action, associates the action with their goal, and understands the feedback.
