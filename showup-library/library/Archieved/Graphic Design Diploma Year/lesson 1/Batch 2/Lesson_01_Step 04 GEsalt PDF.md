#### **Gestalt Principles**

Gestalt principles reveal how we naturally organise visual information into meaningful patterns. Rather than seeing individual elements, we perceive unified wholes. Key principles include:

* **Proximity**: Elements that are close together are perceived as related or grouped.  
* **Similarity**: Elements that share similar attributes (e.g., colour, shape, size) are perceived as belonging together.  
* **Continuity**: The eye naturally follows continuous lines or curves, creating a sense of flow and connection.  
* **Closure**: Our brains tend to fill in missing information to perceive complete shapes or forms.  
* **Figure-Ground Relationship**: We distinguish between foreground (figure) and background elements based on contrast and visual cues.

These principles aren't just theoreticalâ€”they drive real-world design decisions in successful brands:

* The famous FedEx logo incorporates a hidden arrow between the 'E' and 'x' characters, utilising the principle of closure to create a subconscious sense of movement, direction and completion.  
* Instagram's grid layout leverages the proximity principle to create visual cohesion and encourage users to perceive individual posts as part of a larger, curated collection.
