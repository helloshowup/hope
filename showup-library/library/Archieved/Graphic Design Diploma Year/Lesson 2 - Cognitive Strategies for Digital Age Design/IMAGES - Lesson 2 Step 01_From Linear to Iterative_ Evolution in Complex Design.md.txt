As you move further into your HND studies, you'll find your projects becoming noticeably more complex, calling for sophisticated approaches beyond what you've used previously. The structured process you're familiar with gives you a solid foundation, but working at a professional level demands greater flexibility and responsiveness. Let's look at how design methodology has evolved to tackle these new challenges.

## Fig 15
**The Fixed Requirements Challenge**  
In real-world scenarios, client needs frequently shift throughout a project. What seems clear at the outset often changes once designs begin to materialize. For example, a client might spot the need for additional functionality after seeing an initial design concept.
*Have you ever had to adjust your design direction midway through a project because of new information or changing requirements? How did this impact your workflow?*

**The Feedback Timing Issue**  
When feedback comes late in the process, discovering fundamental issues after significant development can throw off timelines and budgets. 
*Have you ever spent ages on a detailed piece of work only to receive feedback that required you to rethink a fundamental aspect? How did that impact your timeline and motivation? Iterative design aims to prevent such situations.*

- **Plan:** Define specific goals for this iteration (e.g., testing a navigation concept)
- **Design (Low-Fidelity):** Create quick, inexpensive prototypes to test concepts
- **Test/Feedback:** Gather input from users or stakeholders on the prototype
- **Refine:** Make adjustments based on the feedback received
- **Repeat/Advance:** Decide whether to iterate further or move to another aspect
Suggested search terms:

### Case Study: Responsive Website Design
Suggested search terms:
- website design
- responsive layout
- web development
- user interface
- mobile friendly

## Fig 27
**More Linear Approach:** 
A designer spends three weeks crafting detailed mockups for all pages of a responsive e-commerce website. During the client presentation, they discover the navigation system fails on mobile devices and key user journeys weren't considered. The project falls behind as they rework significant portions.
*Key Takeaway: Late-stage feedback resulted in costly rework and timeline delays.*
Suggested search terms:
- mobile device
- responsive design
- user journey
- website mockup
- e-commerce

## Fig 28
**More Iterative Approach:**
The same designer takes an iterative approach:
- **Iteration 1: Wireframes & Feedback** - Creates wireframes of key pages and navigation systems, sharing them with the client after just three days.
- **Iteration 2: Refined Navigation & User Flows** - After receiving feedback, they refine the navigation and map out critical user journeys.
- **Iteration 3: Responsive Mockups & Testing** - Develops higher-fidelity mockups of critical user journeys across different devices.
- **Iteration 4: Final Refinement** - Makes final adjustments based on testing results.
Suggested search terms:
- wireframes
- navigation
- user flows
- responsive mockups

## Fig 29
Through regular check-ins, issues are identified early, and the final design is delivered on schedule with minimal revisions needed.
*Key Takeaway: Early feedback on wireframes prevented significant rework on detailed mockups, directly addressing the Feedback Timing Issue.*
