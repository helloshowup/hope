Good documentation can transform a scattered campaign into a cohesive effort. Recently at Reformation, designers tackled conflicting feedback from retailers and environmental consultants by using structured documentation, which helped them create a solution that pleased both groups. Well-crafted templates don't just tidy up information—they transform random insights into practical strategies, helping you build sustainable fashion campaigns that speak clearly across different platforms.

The methods you saw in "Evolving the Fashion Campaign Through Stakeholder Feedback" showed how various perspectives shape campaign development. Now we're providing structured templates that make feedback management methodical rather than haphazard, giving you practical tools to bring order to your design process.

**Try This when you're swamped with messy client feedback**: Take your latest project and sort all feedback into three columns: visual elements, messaging, and functionality. Mark contradictory comments in a different colour. What patterns do you notice when organising feedback this way? How might this shift your approach to your next client meeting?

### The Stakeholder Input Matrix
The sustainable fashion industry brings together diverse stakeholders with occasionally competing priorities. The Stakeholder Input Matrix template helps you:
Suggested search terms:
- textile
- fashion industry
- sustainable design
- stakeholder collaboration
- supply chain

## Fig 9
* Group feedback by source (consumers, sustainability experts, retail partners)
* Label comments by design element (typography, colour palette, imagery, messaging)
* Score feedback urgency on a 1-5 scale
* Note initial response strategies
Suggested search terms:
- typography
- colour palette
- imagery
- retail partners
- sustainability experts

## Fig 10
**Example in Practice:** I recently worked with a student whose campaign got conflicting feedback about eco-certification badges—sustainability experts wanted them more prominent while consumers found them visually distracting. The matrix helped spot this tension and prioritise a design solution that satisfied both needs.
Suggested search terms:
- mountain
- forest
- certification badge
- sustainability
- consumer

## Fig 11
**Try This when stakeholders give clashing feedback on your sustainability designs**: Draw a simple two-column table with "Sustainability Expert Feedback" and "Consumer Feedback" as headers. Add 3-4 points from each perspective based on your current project (or a hypothetical one). Circle the most conflicting points. How might you visually resolve these tensions in your next design iteration?
Suggested search terms:
- table

### Customer Feedback Form
Getting useful customer feedback needs more than just asking "Did you like it?" A thoughtfully designed feedback form should:

## Fig 13
* Assess visual impact ("How strongly did the sustainability message come across in the imagery?")
* Gauge emotional response ("What feelings did the campaign evoke?")
* Measure behavioural intent ("How likely are you to investigate the sustainable practices mentioned?")
Suggested search terms:
- sustainable practices
- environmental impact
- emotional response
- visual messaging
- behavioral intent

## Fig 14
**Example Application:** In a recent case study, initial feedback showed that while customers liked the aesthetic, many completely missed the sustainability message. This prompted a redesign emphasising clearer visual sustainability cues.

**Try This when you have too many revision requests and limited time**: Sketch a simple 2x2 grid labelled "High Impact/Low Effort," "High Impact/High Effort," "Low Impact/Low Effort," and "Low Impact/High Effort." Place your current revision requests in the appropriate sections. Start with the High Impact/Low Effort items first. How does this change how you see your workload? What will you tackle first in your next work session?
