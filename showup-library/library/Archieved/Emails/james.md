Morning James and the cute peach,

i was about to sart work this moring. and i looked at the colourful blocks that is my way of writing down my to dos. (I am, and have always been in love with bright constrasty colours. Maybe its the adhd. Maybe im still a kindergrardener. 

anyway. as you can see the in below. "whatsapp james" has been its own for a while. 

So, when i sat down this morning to organse my "to do" list, i had the urge to do something that i like doing. 

I miss writing emails to friends. Whatsapp messages are so short, and, frankly, i suck at whatsapp messages. I do like writing emails like we did in the 90's and early 2000. when email was a cool way to send a letter. as appose the the deluge of notifications and newsletters that is now almost everyones inbox. im sure you frowned a tiny bit when you read that i like writing emails. 

anyway. so why not send a long whatsapp message. i hear you murmer. well. medium is the message and all that. no one likes opening up a whatasapp message and see that its so long that facebook kindly abbreviated it with a "read more" like note. 

whats a mother to do in this digital world? 

this a very long winded way of explaining this message, which is to say, ive been meaning to get back to you. but couldnt be arsed to write a short "good thanks, and you?" type of message. instead you get this long ass reply.

To answer your question. the weather is turning in cape town. i always welcome the change. but this summer wasnt nearly as hot as normal to make me welcome the cooler weather. i see you are gearing up for your summer! 

anyway. later that day i sent the pic from sandy bay, i was on the beach casually listening to a group of muscled onlyfans daddies who decided to send summer off with a dose of GHD in the sun. it was a strange sight. 6-8 muscled dudes standing in a circle having a fat chat while each of them sporting a massive erection. 

let the record show that i did not chose to sit next to them, but as the day progressed the started to huddle nearnby. close enough for me to have a genetle snooze while eavesdropping. (if you are expecting this story to have sordid end with me gallantantly off with them in the bushes, let me crush your dreams right now. Nothing happened. every now and then 2 of them would saunter off to teh bushes. but they did so without me. 

anyway. i degress again. there i was on the beach, listen to these local gays chatting to a new guy who was a late season visitor. when a phrases caught my attention. 

"Are you local?" one of them with a bubblebutt asked. 

"But not cape town. but you will soon learn that no one is from cape town originally. everyone is from somewhere else."

this was met with a chorus of yess and ja's from the rest of them.

internally, i was "excuse me. some of us have been here the whole time."

but he was right in some way. cape town is changing. it has always been a "travel destination" but relatively niche. its never the first holiday destination anyone takes. but since lockdown or whatever, thats changed. how can i describe this. like the international world, and its digital nomads, have "adopted" cape town in teh same way a group of friends will decide a local pub is now their hangout. not only that. but its a "cool hangout". they are now the experts in the pub. 

im not complaining. in fact i welcome it. i think its the reason why i met you. which is a net positive. but i do kinda feel like the old guy who has been coming to this pub for years, and slightly bewildered that things i have taken for granted my entire life (mountain views etc), are held in such esteem.

but i do appreciate cape town. the mountain is turning green with bit of rain we have had recently, and my view of devils peak this morning was, for lack of a better word charming. so, if a 43 year old man who has lived here his entire life, can appreciate the views and still think it special, then i cant snub newcomers for thinking the same.

I will sign off now. I have more share. I will tell you about someone who approached me to be a "spokeperson" for their anti agesinism social media campaign. I declined, for various reasons. But primarily because the project is so misguided and tone deaf that he called it Affirmative Ageing. 

Dont feel the need to reply in length as I do. a short message is perfectly great. but permit me to write my long ass responses.

Hows Tommy doing? Has he a new job yet? 

cheers,

Bryce
