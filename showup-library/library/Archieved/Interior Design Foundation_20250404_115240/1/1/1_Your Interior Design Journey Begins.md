# Your Interior Design Journey Begins

# Interior Design Foundations

## HNC Interior Design: Your Creative Journey Begins

The HNC Interior Design Foundation course marks the beginning of your professional design path. Whether you're changing careers or pursuing a long-held passion, you'll develop the fundamental skills needed to thrive in the world of interior design.

Interior design goes far beyond selecting attractive furnishings or colour schemes. It's about understanding how spaces affect human behaviour, solving spatial problems creatively, and communicating design ideas effectively. Throughout this course, you'll develop both technical skills and design intuition that will enable you to create functional, beautiful environments that enhance people's lives.

Your diverse backgrounds and perspectives will enrich our learning community. We encourage active participation through sharing ideas, asking questions, and embracing the creative process. Remember, design is iterative—your skills will develop progressively with practice and constructive feedback.

## Your Learning Journey: Course Structure

The course is structured to systematically build your skills from fundamentals to applied projects:

**Weeks 1-3: Design Foundations**  
Exploration of fundamental design principles to develop your visual literacy. You'll begin training your designer's eye to recognise elements like balance, proportion, and contrast while building a professional design vocabulary.

**Weeks 4-6: Technical Skills Development**  
Learning key technical drawing, space planning, and an introduction to industry-standard CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software—transforming your creative ideas into professional presentations.

**Weeks 7-9: Materials and Application**  
Exploration of materials, finishes, and furnishings while developing your understanding of how these elements work together in cohesive design schemes.

**Weeks 10-12: Project Development**  
Application of everything you've learnt in a comprehensive design project that will become the first piece in your professional portfolio.

Each week combines theory with hands-on activities that reinforce concepts through practical application. Your progress will be assessed through project work that builds your professional portfolio rather than traditional exams. You'll receive constructive feedback focused on your growth as a designer, with opportunities to revise and refine your work.

## Getting Started: Your Design Toolkit

### Important Equipment

To begin your design journey, you'll need some basic tools:

- **Sketchbook** (A4 or larger) for ideation and observation exercises
- **Drawing pencils** (2H, HB, 2B provide a good range)
- **Scale ruler** (architectural scale with 1:20, 1:50, and 1:100 measurements)
- **Set square and compass** for technical drawing
- **Tracing paper** for design development
- **Computer with internet access** for research and digital work

Don't worry about specialised design software yet—this will be introduced gradually, starting with fundamentals in Week 4 using student versions of industry-standard programs.

### Creating Your Design Space

Your workspace doesn't need to be elaborate, but should ideally include:
- A flat surface with good lighting (natural light is best)
- Comfortable seating that supports proper posture
- Storage for organising materials and keeping projects clean
- Wall space or pinboard for displaying inspiration and work-in-progress

Many successful designers began at kitchen tables or small desks in spare corners—what matters is creating a dedicated space that signals to your brain it's time for creative work.

### First Week Preparation

Before the first session, please:
1. Gather your basic equipment listed above
2. Take photographs of three spaces you find particularly inspiring
3. Start collecting design inspiration (magazines, photos, material samples)
4. Complete the "Design Influences" questionnaire in your welcome pack
5. Explore the online learning platform to familiarise yourself with resources

## Connecting to Your Professional Future

The skills you develop in this foundation course directly prepare you for the next stage, "Professional Interior Design." The spatial awareness exercises practised in the coming weeks will form the foundation for analysing professional case studies and understanding project workflows. The terminology and technical drawing fundamentals you learn now will directly enhance your ability to engage with professional contexts and communicate with clients.

As one former student shared: "I came in thinking interior design was about choosing pretty furnishings. I left understanding how to transform spaces in ways that genuinely improve people's lives—and with the technical skills to make it happen."

Your unique perspective will develop as this journey begins. Your design future starts now—let's begin seeing the world through a designer's eyes!

## Over to You

Take a moment to reflect on what drew you to interior design. What spaces have made the strongest impression on you, and why? Consider how your previous experiences—whether professional or personal—might inform your approach to design. Jot down your thoughts in your sketchbook; we'll revisit these reflections as your designer's eye develops throughout the course.
