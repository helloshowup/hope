# Assignment 0.3: Formative (Interior Space Analysis and Design Development)

This assessment helps you demonstrate your understanding and application of interior space analysis, colour theory, and professional design development skills.

### Task 1: Space Selection and Analysis:

**Learning Outcome:**

* LO1 \- Demonstrate baseline understanding of interior design fundamentals  
* LO4 \- Display foundational understanding of design principles

1.1 Select three different interior spaces from design magazines, websites, or professional blogs. These will be used in the upcoming tasks, where you will create an analysis sheet with relevant images and visual documentation.

### Task 2: Functional Analysis:

**Learning Outcome:**

* LO1 \- Demonstrate baseline understanding of interior design fundamentals  
* LO5 \- Show potential for professional practice development 

2.1. Based on your selections from 1.1, create an analysis sheet for each space (one page per room) with relevant images and visual documentation. These spaces will be used for detailed analysis in the upcoming tasks.

### Task 3: Design Elements Analysis:

**Learning Outcome:** LO4 \- Display foundational understanding of design principles

You will need to document and analyse the key design elements in each space:

Colours

* List the main colours you observe.  
* Note if theyâ€™re warm or cool.  
* Describe if they are bright or neutral.

Textures

* Identify the main textures in the space.  
* Note if surfaces appear smooth or rough.  
* List the main materials you recognize.

Focal Points

* Identify what catches your attention first.  
* Explain why this element stands out.  
* Describe its relation to the rest of the room.

3.1 Do this by writing a short paragraph for each space (100 words) analysing if the design choices you have identified either succeed or fail based on functional and aesthetic criteria. You can use the below as starting points for your discussions:

* Describe the general feeling of the room.  
* Note how the design elements work together.  
* Consider how the space makes you feel.

### Task 4: Creating Your Own Design

**Learning Outcome:**

* LO4 \- Display foundational understanding of design principles  
* LO5 \- Show potential for professional practice development  
* LO6 \- Demonstrate reflective practice potential

This section builds directly on your space analysis from Task 1-3. You'll develop a practical design concept for your chosen room, demonstrating your understanding of design fundamentals through clear visual and written components.

4.1. Space Selection

* Choose one room from your part 1-3 analysis  
* Review your existing documentation of this space  
* Identify one negative feature of the room that could be improved (this will serve as an introduction for your new design)

4.2. Visual Development 

Create a new focused mood board that communicates a new design vision based on the room that you have selected above. 

* Select 4-6 key inspiration images showing style, colour, and materials (compile all images on a single page)  
* Develop two distinct but cohesive colour schemes (three colours each)  
* Choose material samples that align with your design direction \- include at least 3 samples/images for both colour schemes

4.3. Written Documentation 

Develop a comprehensive design explanation (200-300 words) by responding to these guiding questions based on 1 and 2 of task 4:

4.3.1 Understanding Your Design Journey

* How did your chosen inspiration images shape your overall design direction?  
* Which specific elements from these images most influenced your design decisions?

4.3.2 Exploring Colour and Material Decisions

* How have the initial inspirational images influenced your choice of samples?How do your chosen materials enhance both the aesthetic appeal and functional requirements of the space?  
* In what ways do your selected colours and materials work together to support the needs of the users?

4.3.3 Evaluating Your Design's Effectiveness

* Which aspects of your design most effectively support the room's intended purpose, and why?

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] **Space Analysis Package:** Three interior space images with analysis sheets documenting key features, functional analysis, and user groups for each space  
- [ ] **Design Elements Documentation:** Analysis of colours, textures, and focal points for each space, including 100-word written justification addressing success criteria  
- [ ] **Design Development Package**: Mood board with 4-6 inspiration images, two three-colour schemes, and three material samples for your selected room  
- [ ] **Written Design Explanation (200-300 words):** Documentation of design journey, material and colour decisions, and effectiveness evaluation for chosen space
