# Colour Theory in Practice

Colour influences how we experience spaces. It shapes our mood, marks out different areas, and quietly reveals design intentions.

## 1. Colour Fundamentals

### Colour Properties: Beyond the Basics

Your HNC studies will explore the colour wheel in depth, but let's focus on the subtle qualities that genuinely affect how colours appear in actual spaces:

- **Hue**: The colour itself (red, blue, yellow, etc.)  
- **Value**: The lightness or darkness of a colour  
- **Saturation**: The intensity or purity of a colour
- **Undertones**: Those hidden underlying hues that emerge under various lighting conditions

Here's what these properties look like in everyday examples:

- **Hue**: Picture a cherry red sports car - that's a vibrant red hue.
- **Value**: A deep burgundy leather sofa has a lower value (darker) than bright red.
- **Saturation**: The vivid yellow of a sunflower has high saturation, while vintage mustard upholstery appears more muted (lower saturation).
- **Undertones**: Have you ever painted a wall beige only to find it looks strangely pink or green? That's the undertones showing themselves in your particular lighting.

**Try This when exploring color variations in your environment:** A light blue wall with warm undertones (low saturation, high value) creates a completely different feeling than a deep navy blue wall with cool undertones (low saturation, low value). Nailing these subtle distinctions makes all the difference in creating your desired atmosphere. Take a photo of a space where color dramatically affects the mood.

### Colour Schemes: The Why Behind Design Choices

Rather than just defining colour relationships, let's look at when and why designers choose specific schemes:

- **Monochromatic**: Produces a clean, unified appearance; ideal for smaller spaces or when highlighting texture variations
- **Analogous**: Creates a harmonious, calming atmosphere; perfect in spaces meant for relaxation
- **Complementary**: Produces energy and visual contrast; excellent for emphasizing architectural features or creating focal points
- **Split-complementary**: Provides visual interest without the intensity of complementary schemes; works well in multi-functional spaces
- **Triadic**: Establishes a vibrant, balanced feel; suited to creative areas or spaces meant to encourage conversation

**Try This when analyzing designed spaces:** Find three interior photos you like. For each, identify the colour scheme and note why you think the designer selected it for that particular space. How does it support the room's purpose and mood? Notice which schemes naturally match your personal preferences. Jot down which scheme feels most aligned with your personal style.

## 2. Application Methods

### The Impact of Light and Orientation

Light changes how we perceive colour, which is why experienced designers never select colours without thinking about the room's orientation and lighting. That perfect paint colour in the shop might look totally different on your walls at home.

Designers always consider how light affects colour appearance:

- North-facing rooms receive cooler, more consistent light that tends to make colours appear more muted
- South-facing rooms get warm, direct light that can intensify colours
- East-facing rooms receive bright morning light that changes dramatically throughout the day
- West-facing rooms enjoy warm afternoon light that can create strong shadows

**Try This during different times of day in your living space:** Take three colour samples. Place them in different spots around your home with varying light conditions. See how they look at different times of day (morning, midday, evening). You'll be surprised how much the same colour shifts depending on light and orientation. Take photos to reference when choosing colours for future projects. Note which lighting condition creates your favorite effect.

### The Professional Selection Process: 60-30-10 Rule

When you walk into a well-designed room, you might not immediately spot the careful balance of colours, but you'll definitely sense it. Many designers use a proven formula to create balance while avoiding the common mistake of using too many competing colours.

The 60-30-10 rule offers a reliable starting point for balanced colour distribution:

1. **60% - Dominant colour**: Used for walls, large furniture, or flooring
2. **30% - Secondary colour**: Applied to smaller furniture pieces, accent walls, or textiles
3. **10% - Accent colour**: Reserved for accessories, artwork, or decorative elements

**Why it works**: This balance establishes visual hierarchy while still allowing creative expression through those vibrant accent colours.

**Try This when evaluating professional interior designs:** Find a room photo you think looks fantastic. Analyze how the 60-30-10 rule is applied (or deliberately broken). Then create a simple colour palette for a bedroom following this rule, explaining your choices based on the room's orientation and the mood you want to achieve. Sketch a quick layout showing where each colour would appear. Share your palette with someone and get their first impression.

### Colour and Materials: Critical Interactions

The relationship between colour and material is crucial to successful design. That perfect blue you've chosen might look dramatically different on silk versus concrete. Understanding these interactions helps you avoid expensive mistakes and achieve more sophisticated results.

Colours transform depending on what they're applied to:

- Matte surfaces absorb light, making colours look deeper and more subdued
- Glossy surfaces reflect light, making colours look more vibrant
- Textured surfaces create shadows, adding depth and variation to colours
- Natural materials like wood or stone have inherent colour variations that interact with applied colours

**Try This with materials you have access to:** Gather three different material samples (perhaps fabric, wood, and a painted surface). Apply or place the same colour on each. Notice how the colour changes based on the material. How might this affect your design decisions? Identify which material treatment best matches your initial vision.

### Introduction to Colour Documentation
As you continue exploring colour theory, you might find it helpful to start building your own reference collection.

[Image: A designer's workspace showing an organized collection of color samples, material swatches, and a mood board in progress with notes.

**Try This as you begin developing your design resource library:** This habit will not only prepare you for HNC studies but also help you develop an instinctive feel for how colours work together in actual spaces. Consider these ideas:

- Collect physical colour samples from paint charts, fabric swatches, and material samples that catch your eye
- Organize your samples in whatever way makes sense to you, grouping colours that seem to work well together
- When you find a combination you love, make notes about where you might use these colours (walls, furniture, accents)

Start with just three samples that instantly appeal to you.
