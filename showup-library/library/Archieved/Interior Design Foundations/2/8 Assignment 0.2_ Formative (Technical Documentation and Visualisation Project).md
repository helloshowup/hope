# Assignment 0.2: Formative (Technical Documentation and Visualisation Project)

This assessment helps you demonstrate your understanding and application of professional drawing techniques, digital integration, and documentation skills from Lessons 1-2.

## Task 1: Quiz

**Learning Outcomes:** 

* **LO2** \- Show aptitude for technical skills development  
* **LO4** \- Display foundational understanding of design principles

Before starting your next task, complete the mandatory multiple-choice quiz for Lesson 2 to assess your understanding and identify areas for improvement.

# Task 2: Technical Documentation and Visualisation Project

**Learning Outcome: LO1 \-** Demonstrate baseline understanding of interior design fundamentals

**Space Selection and Initial Analysis:**

Choose your bedroom or living room as your study space. Using the observation and documentation skills from Lesson 1, complete the following:

* Take accurate measurements of the room's length and width.

Measure and note the position of windows, doors, and other architectural features Identify different functional zones in the space.

Task 3 Hand-Drawn Documentation:

**Learning Outcome: LO2** \- Show aptitude for technical skills development 

Practice the professional line weight techniques and architectural symbols from Lesson 2:

* Create a floorplan sketch with all measurements marked.  
* Label all functional zones (e.g., sleeping, working, storage)

Task 4 Digital Visualisation:

**Learning Outcome: LO2** \- Show aptitude for technical skills development 

Using the skills from the Digital Tools Foundation section:

* Scan your sketch of the room floorplan   
* Using Canva, Procreate or a similar platform, place your scanned drawing on a new sheet.   
* Using digital tools, include basic furniture symbols using simple shapes or icons for example: basic furniture symbols for main pieces that define the space's function (bed, desk, sofa, etc.).  
  * Be sure to include symbols for furniture pieces as they are currently in the space.  
* Label the key items   
* Indicate the traffic path and flow through the space

Refer to the provided resource on [how to scan drawings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jY0mLen4p1M4fSHAzB4wlWFKF5w5xh8dvROSSq7_LwE/edit?tab=t.0) in the assignment resource section.

Task 5: Written Analysis:

## **Learning Outcomes:** 

* ## **LO3:** Demonstrate capacity for self-directed learning

* **LO4:** Display foundational understanding of design principles 

Document your process and learning (approximately 500 words):

Explain how your documentation methods (both hand-drawn and digital) help communicate the room's features and challenges

Reflect on what you learned about the space through this documentation process

**Note**: Focus on documenting key elements that impact the room's functionality and flow. You don't need to include every decorative item \- concentrate on furniture and features that define how the space is used.

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] **Quiz Completion:** Confirmed completion of the multiple-choice quiz for Lesson 2 on the Online Learning Centre  
- [ ] **Initial Room Documentation:** Room measurements of length and width, notes on architectural features, and documentation of functional zones and traffic paths  
- [ ] **Hand-drawn Floorplan:** A4 sketch showing room layout with measurements marked, functional zones labelled.  
- [ ] **Digital Floorplan:** Scanned hand-drawn sketch converted to digital format with furniture symbols, labels and traffic flow patterns  
- [ ] **Written Analysis (500 words):** Documentation methods explanation and reflection on space analysis findings, including key features and challenges
