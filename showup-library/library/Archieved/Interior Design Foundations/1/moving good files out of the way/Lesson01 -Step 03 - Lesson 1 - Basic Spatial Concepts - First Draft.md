# **Step 3 \- Lesson 1 \- Basic Spatial Concepts**

Understanding spatial concepts is fundamental to interior design. These concepts help us comprehend how objects and spaces relate to each other, providing essential vocabulary for discussing design principles.

## **Understanding Distance and Depth**

In interior design, **distance** plays a crucial role as it determines the measurable space between objects in a room. For example, the recommended distance between a sofa and coffee table is 45-50cm to allow comfortable movement while maintaining easy access.

While planning spaces, designers must consider **depth**â€”the extent to which an object or space reaches backward from its front edge. For example, standard kitchen countertops typically have a depth of 60cm, while closets usually require 60-70cm to accommodate hangers properly. Understanding depth is crucial when planning furniture layouts and storage solutions, as it affects both functionality and visual balance in a space. When designing room layouts, consider both the physical depth of furniture pieces and the perceived depth created by layering elements at different distances from walls. Depth can also create visual effects through layered furniture arrangements or colour gradients that make spaces appear deeper or shallower.

## **Basic Shapes and Forms**

## **The Concept of Scale**

When designing spaces, **scale** emerges as a critical factor, governing how elements relate to each other in size, their occupied space, and their proportions relative to human dimensions.

A large room might need appropriately scaled furniture to avoid feeling empty, while a small space requires carefully considered furniture placement to avoid overcrowding. Understanding scale allows you to create functional, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing rooms. This involves being able to assess not only the existing features of a space, such as dimensions, architectural details, and lighting, but also how users will move and interact within that space.

## **Height Relationships**

In the realm of spatial design, **height relationships** serve as powerful tools for shaping perception and experience. From the impact of cathedral ceilings to the intimate feel of a reading nook, vertical dimensions fundamentally affect how we interact with our surroundings.

This use of height relationships defines the zone and adds ambiance. Compare this setup to Fig 8, where the absence of hanging lights creates a more open and expansive feel.

## **Space Division Techniques**

The most sophisticated room divisions often go unnoticed, yet they subtly guide our movement and behavior.

Note the use of differing floor materials, strategically placed pendant lights, and furniture arrangement to define distinct zones within the open space.](https://www.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/photos/2470951427/display_1500/stock-photo-isometric-room-minimal-cafe-store-open-inside-interior-architecture-d-rendering-2470951427.jpg)**

Rather than relying on walls, skilled designers employ a variety of clever techniques to define spaces:

* Shift floor materials from hardwood to carpet, indicating a transition from active to quiet zones.  
* Install pendant lights to create seamless ceiling planes  
* Position bookcases or screens at angles to indicate separate areas.  
* Use color gradients or pattern changes to indicate different functional spaces.

**Practice Activity:** Find three examples in your immediate environment where space has been divided without walls. Document these using photographs or sketches, noting the specific methods used.

## **Traffic Flow Patterns**

Analyse how people move through a space by identifying main circulation routes and secondary paths. Consider entrance points, natural movement patterns, and connections between different zones. Ensure pathways are clear and logical, avoiding obstacles or unusual transitions.

**Practice Activity:** Using a simple floorplan sketch of your room:

1. Mark primary circulation paths in red.  
2. Mark secondary paths in blue.  
3. Identify any bottlenecks or awkward transitions.  
4. Suggest possible enhancements
