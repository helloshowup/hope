Welcome to your interior design journey! 
Whether the world of design is a whole new territory for you - or you want to further develop your creative skills -  you've come to the right place

Sometimes starting something new can feel a little overwhelming - so, let’s break it all down into manageable steps.

This video is part of your first lesson, which is all about finding your design footing. For those who have never studied design before - think of it as learning a new language - beginning with the basic 'ABC’s' of design. 

In lesson 2, you'll learn to speak the language of design - starting with sketching. Even if your drawing skills only stretch as far as stick figures, you'll soon discover simple techniques to communicate your design ideas. 

By lesson 3, you'll be stepping into the shoes of a design professional. You’ll see how professional designers work - complete with examples of fascinating projects. 

Finally, lesson 4 is all about showcasing your design story. This is where you will see all your hard work come together in your first design portfolio. You will be amazed at what you can achieve with just four lessons, even starting from scratch. 

But before we dive in, let's discuss the essential tools you'll need for this design journey. Don't worry - there's no pressure to get everything at once. Some items are needed now - but others can wait.

For lesson 1, you'll just need the basics - a standard measuring tape - an A3 sketchbook - if you can’t get your hands on an A3, an A4 can work at this early stage - you’ll need regular pencils, an eraser - and a ruler. 
As we progress through lessons 2-4, you'll add a scale ruler, special drawing pencils such as H, 2H, and HB -  as well as a basic drawing compass, and set squares. Many art supply stores offer student discounts, so be sure to use your student card. 

The technical requirements are straightforward and will build gradually- but some tools are essential - such as a computer or laptop with internet access - plus a smartphone with a camera. As we progress, you’ll learn about software tools like Canva  - Google Drive and basic photo editing tools.

Now let's talk about creating your own design haven. Putting together an effective learning space doesn't require perfection - many successful graduates started their studies at a kitchen table! All you need is a table or desk, good lighting, a comfortable chair, and storage for supplies. As you progress, you might want to add elements like a pin board or blank wall space, and ideally - your own dedicated workspace.

Digital organisation is just as important as physical space - so when you begin your first lesson, you'll need to create a folder on your computer and label it  "Interior Design Course". For back up - it's a good idea to create a cloud storage account, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive - and bookmark your course websites for easy access.

As we look forward to this journey together, you'll soon see how your design confidence will grow. You will earn a professional knowledge base, your own first design portfolio - and you’ll have the opportunity to make industry connections. 

So before you do anything - go to the student forum and introduce yourself. Review the Lesson 1 materials, gather up your basic supplies, and begin developing your design awareness.

Remember, every interior designer started as a beginner.
