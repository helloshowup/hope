# Step 5 Lesson 1 - First Space Documentation - Initial Draft

## The Designer's Lens: Capturing Space with Precision

You simply can't transform a space without truly understanding it first. Solid documentation forms the backbone of smart design decisions—gathering exact measurements, detailed sketches, and telling photographs that reveal the space's true character.

## 1. Documentation Essentials: Your Starting Toolkit

Before jumping into any space assessment, you'll need to gather the right tools for the job. Consider this toolkit your professional foundation—each item has a specific purpose in helping you translate three-dimensional reality into usable design information. The care taken in preparing these tools reflects the precision brought to design work.

### Documentation Preparation

Preparation marks true professionalism in design. Taking time to sort tools before a site visit not only streamlines the process but also shows clients you mean business. A well-prepared designer builds confidence from the moment they step through the door, ready to capture every vital detail.

Round up your basic documentation kit:
* Measuring tape (5m or longer works best)
* Scale ruler for proportional drawing
* Notebook for notes and quick sketches
* Pencils (HB and 2B) and erasers
* Digital camera/smartphone for photos

**Try This before your first client site visit:** Put together a portable kit that's ready to grab when heading out. Keeping your tools organized helps prevent mistakes and builds good professional habits. 

### Capturing Measurements: The Spatial Blueprint

Accurate measurements underpin all design work that follows. What might seem like simply recording numbers actually demands careful attention and methodical thinking. Each dimension recorded tells part of the space's story—how rooms connect, where limitations exist, and what possibilities might be hidden within the existing architecture.

Measurements provide the factual backbone of your documentation:
* Start from one consistent point (typically a corner)
* Take overall dimensions first, then details
* Record ceiling heights and any variations
* Mark window and door positions from the nearest corners

[Image: Designer demonstrating proper measurement technique in a kitchen space, showing how to hold the tape measure flush against the wall while recording dimensions in a systematic pattern. Caption: "Fig 3: Precise measurement technique demonstration showing how to capture accurate dimensions while maintaining consistent methodology across different architectural elements"]

**Over to you:** Think about how dimensions affect our experience of spaces. How different does a narrow hallway feel compared to a wide one? How does ceiling height change the atmosphere?

### Photo Documentation: The Visual Record

Photos capture what measurements and notes cannot—the quality of light, the texture of materials, and the overall feel of a space. A systematic approach to photography ensures you don't miss crucial details that might influence your design decisions later. Remember that these images will become your reference when you're back at your desk, possibly weeks after your visit.

Create a thorough photographic record:
* Take context shots from entry points
* Work your way around the room clockwise
* Photograph specific features and conditions
* Use a logical naming system for your files

[Image: Grid of six professional interior photographs showing the same dining room captured systematically from different angles, with close-ups of architectural details and material conditions. Caption: "Fig 4: Comprehensive photographic documentation sequence demonstrating professional coverage patterns that capture both overall spatial relationships and critical design details"]

**Try This when documenting your own living spaces:** In your home, photograph each room following this approach, and notice how different angles show different qualities of the space. Which angle best captures the room's true character?

### Basic Sketching: Translating Space to Paper

While digital tools have transformed the design process, the humble sketch remains invaluable for quick spatial thinking. Drawing by hand links your eye, brain, and hand in a unique way that helps you grasp proportions and relationships intuitively. Your sketches don't need to be gallery-worthy—they just need to clearly communicate what you observe.

Sketching captures spatial relationships that numbers and photos might miss:
* Start with light, flowing lines to establish proportions
* Build detail gradually
* Write notes directly on your sketches
* Develop simple, clear symbols for common elements

## 2. Room Analysis: Reading the Space

Documentation goes beyond recording what exists—it's about understanding why a space works the way it does. Room analysis asks you to engage all your senses and think critically about how the physical environment shapes human experience. This deeper level of observation separates casual looking from professional seeing, allowing you to spot both problems and opportunities others might overlook.

### Initial Observation

Those first moments in a space are gold. Before your eye adjusts to the environment, you'll notice things that might fade from awareness later. This initial impression phase captures valuable insights about how the space communicates and functions. Don't rush—these observations often reveal the most important aspects of a space that need addressing in your design.

Before measuring, simply observe:
* How does the space unfold as you move through it?
* Notice functional zones and natural pathways
* Watch how light falls and changes
* Note sensory experiences (temperature, sounds, textures)

[Image: Designer standing in the doorway of a historic room with natural light streaming through windows, notebook in hand, actively observing and recording initial impressions before beginning measurements. Caption: "Fig 6: The critical observation phase showing a designer analyzing light patterns, circulation paths, and spatial qualities before beginning technical documentation"]

**Try This when entering an unfamiliar room for assessment:** Stand at the entrance to a room. Jot down your first three impressions to sharpen your spatial awareness. Compare these notes with your final assessment later.

### Systematic Measurement

Approaching measurement methodically ensures accuracy and completeness. Each dimension recorded builds upon the last, creating a thorough spatial understanding that will shape all future design decisions. Professional designers develop a rhythm to this process, moving efficiently through spaces while double-checking critical dimensions.

Create an accurate dimensional record:
* Work methodically around the room
* Note both individual and running measurements
* Include vertical dimensions and clearances
* Document any irregularities (odd corners, floor level changes)

[Image: Designer's working floor plan sketch showing progressive measurement documentation with both individual dimensions and running measurements clearly marked, including notes about ceiling height variations. Caption: "Fig 7: Working measurement documentation showing professional notation techniques for capturing both standard dimensions and architectural irregularities"]

### Feature Inventory

Every space contains a hierarchy of elements that define its character and function. Learning to group these features helps you understand what can be changed easily versus what represents a significant constraint. This inventory becomes particularly valuable when prioritizing design interventions and managing budgets, as it clearly distinguishes between structural necessities and cosmetic opportunities.

List the elements that define the space:
* Fixed elements (structural components, built-ins)
* Semi-fixed elements (furniture, light fixtures)
* Circulation elements (doors, pathways)
* Service elements (outlets, switches, plumbing)

[Image: Interior photograph of a contemporary apartment with digital overlay highlighting different categories of elements using a colour-coded system - structural elements in red, fixtures in blue, circulation in green, and services in yellow. Caption: "Fig 8: Feature categorisation system demonstrating professional approach to identifying and classifying fixed, semi-fixed, and service elements for comprehensive spatial analysis"]

### Consistent Notation

Clear communication is vital in design, particularly when you need to revisit your documentation weeks or months later. Developing a personal notation system that balances industry standards with your own shorthand creates efficiency without sacrificing clarity. This professional discipline ensures that your documentation stays valuable throughout the design process, even as project details evolve.

Develop clear communication through your notation:
* Apply standard symbols for common elements
* Create your own shorthand for speed
* Maintain consistent scale and orientation

[Image: Close-up of a professional designer's notebook showing a personalized notation system with industry-standard symbols alongside custom shorthand, with a clear legend explaining the system. Caption: "Fig 9: Professional notation system demonstrating the balance between industry-standard symbols and efficient personal shorthand for rapid on-site documentation"]

**Over to you:** Think about notation systems you've seen in other contexts (maps, instruction manuals, etc.). How might you adapt these principles to develop your own efficient yet clear documentation style? What symbols or shorthand would work best for the types of spaces you're interested in designing?

## 3. Optional Practical Exercise: Documentation in Action

Theory clicks when applied to real-world situations. This exercise invites you to blend all the documentation techniques you've learned into a cohesive process. By working through each step methodically, you'll develop muscle memory for professional documentation practices while discovering which aspects come naturally to you and which need more practice. Remember that documentation skills improve dramatically with practice.

Apply these skills to a real space (allow 30-45 minutes):
1. Choose a room with some interesting challenges
2. Complete a documentation sequence:
   * Observe initially (5 minutes)
   * Take photos (10 minutes)
   * Measure thoroughly (15 minutes)
   * Sketch with notes (10 minutes)
