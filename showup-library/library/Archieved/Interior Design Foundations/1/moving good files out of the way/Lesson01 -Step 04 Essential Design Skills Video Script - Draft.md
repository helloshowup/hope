**Step 4 Lesson 1 \- Basic Design Tools Introduction**

**SCRIPT**

This short video covers some Design tools that every interior designer needs to know. These skills will help you record your ideas and develop creative solutions. We will cover measurements, sketching, photos and basic presentations.

Let's start with **sketching**. A **sketchbook or iPad** is essential for recording ideas and developing design concepts. Whether digital or physical, sketching allows you to quickly capture and develop ideas. When sketching, you can use basic forms to develop furniture layouts and spatial relationships. A **pencil** and **eraser** are essential tools. Practise with different hardness levels \- for initial sketches, a light touch with an **HB** pencil is ideal. When you move on to more detailed drawings, softer pencils will result in darker lines. These range from **2B to 8B** depending on how dark you wish to go. You can use basic geometric shapes to create quick layouts and furnishings.

**Measurement tools** are also essential. A **measuring tape** is a tool that designers will regularly use. Measuring a space is a fundamental step in creating a design. When using a tape-measure, always ensure it is straight and can reach the end points of the area you are measuring. Make sure to make accurate notes of your readings.

A **scale ruler** is used to translate your dimensions onto paper. It has different scales marked directly on it, making it easy to draw accurate plans. For example, on a 1:50 scale, each mark represents 50cm in real life.

Now onto **digital tools**. Use your **phone** or **camera** to take good quality photos to record the spaces you are working on. Ensure photos are well-lit, clear, and capture different angles. Use presentation software like **Canva or Procreate** to create mood boards and sketched plans. These programs help you to quickly produce professional-looking presentations by using their preset templates.

Keep digital files organised with a clear folder structure and use descriptive file names like this 

Project name \- underscore \- floorplan \- underscore version number \- underscore date 

**'ProjectName\_Floorplan\_v1.0\_04.2024'.**

This helps you keep track of your files and easily find them later on when you have compiled a large number of similar files. 

Learning to use these basic tools is an integral part of the practice of interior design. If you consistently include these steps in your approach, it will soon become second nature to you.
