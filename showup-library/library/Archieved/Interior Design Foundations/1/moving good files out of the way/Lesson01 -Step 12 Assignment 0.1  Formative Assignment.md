# Assignment 0.1: Formative (Initial Study Planning)

## Introduction

This assignment focuses on developing essential planning habits for success in the Interior Design Foundation Unit. Effective planning is vital for managing time and making the most of the learning experience. This assignment asks students to set up a study approach for this unit specifically, and to start thinking about how to study for the course in general. This is a formative assignment, which means that it is designed to help develop these crucial skills.

**Note**: The Online Learning Centre (OLC) includes a built-in study planner tool, and given its direct relevance to this assignment, it would be remiss not to acknowledge it. This tool should be used to set the overall study time for the Higher Nation Certificate, while the below is just for the Foundation Unit

## Task 1: Quiz

**Learning Outcome:** LO3 \- Demonstrate capacity for self-directed learning

Before proceeding with the study plan, please ensure that the mandatory multiple-choice quiz associated with Lesson 1 has been completed. This quiz is designed to check knowledge of the content presented in the first lesson, and to help assess where further support is needed.

## Task 2: Initial Study Planning

**Learning Outcome:** LO3 \- Demonstrate capacity for self-directed learning

Students need to develop a study schedule that will help effectively manage time for the Foundation Unit. This unit has four lessons and this study schedule will help with organizing to complete them in good time.

To complete this task students must:

**Set overall study time:** Use the Study Planner on the dashboard of the Online Learning Center to set study time for the entire course. This can be adjusted later if needed. Please note that tutors will be able to see if this step has been completed, so a screenshot of the study planner is not required.

## Task 3: Create a Weekly Schedule

**Learning Outcome:** LO3 \- Demonstrate capacity for self-directed learning

Use the provided spreadsheet template to create a detailed breakdown of the study schedule. Students may also create a similar template of their own, if preferred, but should ensure that it addresses all of the elements listed below. The study schedule should consider the following suggestions:

**Specific Study Times:**

1. While 10-15 hours per week is a suggested guideline, please adjust study time to align with individual circumstances and preferences.  
2. Set regular times each week to work through course materials.  
   * Include time for practicing new skills.  
3. Consider other commitments and optimal working times.  
4. Include time for both learning and practising new skills.  
5. Break work into shorter sessions (2-3 hours at most).

**Suggested Template** Use [the Weekly Study Schedule Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EV3XOWGMgsyztosTpNivLtidC4vFkfXK_SAJaB3a3t4/edit?tab=t.0) provided in the assignment resource section to create a personalized study schedule.

**Remember:** 

- This schedule is a guide that can be adjusted as needed. The goal is to help develop good study habits for the online interior design course.
