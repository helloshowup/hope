The target learner for this foundation unit is an aspiring interior designer without formal training who seeks structured entry into the profession. These diverse individuals—often career-changers or mature students with completed secondary education—share a drive for professional qualification and industry-relevant skills development. The ideal learner possesses basic mathematical ability, English proficiency, and computer literacy, while demonstrating readiness to develop technical drawing, space planning, and digital design competencies. This learner thrives in hands-on, practical environments where theoretical knowledge translates to tangible outcomes, and values constructive feedback while gradually developing self-directed learning capabilities. They face challenges in building fundamental technical skills from a beginner level, understanding professional standards, and establishing organizational discipline. Nonetheless, they demonstrate commitment to mastering the collaborative, detail-oriented aspects of interior design practice through minimal structured exercises, progressive skill development, and reflective practice—ultimately seeking to emerge as confident junior designers with foundational competence and a basic preliminary professional portfolio.
