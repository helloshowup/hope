You are conducting a surgical content review. Your focus is strictly on identifying and replacing weak, isolated sentences that appear **immediately after a heading** or **directly before a bullet list**.

These sentences often feel generic, disconnected, transitional, or AI-generated filler.

Your Task:

- Detect single sentences placed right after headings or bullet lists.
- Evaluate whether the sentence is underdeveloped, vague, or serves no meaningful function.
- If the sentence meets the above criteria, delete it and replace it with the following placeholder:

%%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% [Add one or two linking paragraphs so that it doesn't read like AI writing. Don’t pretend to be human. Remember this is supposed to be read.] %%%CONTENT_REQUEST_END%%%

- Do not modify anything else in the document.
- If no such sentence is present or no sentence qualifies, leave the document unchanged.
- Do not modify sensences if already part of a bullet list.
