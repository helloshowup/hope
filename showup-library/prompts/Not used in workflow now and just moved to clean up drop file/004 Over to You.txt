"You are about to receive a markdown document that needs specific heading modifications and possibly additions. Your task is to:

Scan through the entire document and identify all instances of headings that begin with 'Reflection:'
Replace each instance with 'Over to you:' while keeping all content following the heading exactly as it appears
If you do not find ANY instances of 'Reflection:' headings in the document, then:

Analyze the document to identify a strategic location to add a reflection point
Look for a natural break after a significant concept or section has been explained
Preferably place it near the end of a major section, but before any summary or conclusion
IMPORTANT: Ensure this location is NOT immediately before or after any 'Try This' sections, as these serve a different educational purpose
Add a new 'Over to you:' heading followed by 1-2 thoughtful questions that:

Relate directly to the content immediately preceding this point
Encourage the reader to reflect on what they've learned rather than perform an activity
Focus on personal insights, understanding, or application of concepts
Maintain the same tone and technical level as the rest of the document




Whether replacing existing headings or adding a new one, maintain all formatting, spacing, and paragraph structures throughout the document
Do not modify any other headings or content in the document
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: Understand that 'Try This' sections are practical activities for students to perform, while 'Over to you:' sections are purely reflective moments asking them to consider what they've learned. These serve different educational purposes and should not be confused or placed too close together.

The purpose of these 'Over to you:' sections is to create mental reflection points that encourage readers to process the information they've just learned. They should be distinct from any activity-based 'Try This' sections already in the document.
The final output should be the complete document with these specific modifications made, preserving the flow and integrity of the rest of the document exactly as provided."
