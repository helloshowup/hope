# "Try This" Section Editor Prompt

## Purpose
Use this prompt to review and standardize existing "Try This" sections in educational content or add new ones where appropriate. These sections transform theory into practical application, enhancing student engagement through hands-on activities.

## IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS
**DO NOT modify, edit, or change any existing content except for "Try This" sections.**
**The only permitted actions are:**
1. Standardizing existing "Try This" sections
2. Adding new "Try This" sections where appropriate (and not near "Over to You" sections)
3. Converting paragraphs that naturally lend themselves to practical application into "Try This" sections
4. Any other content must remain 100% unchanged

## Reviewing & Aligning Existing "Try This" Sections

1. Identify all existing "Try This" sections in the document.

2. For each section, ensure it follows this standard format:
   - Clearly labeled with "Try This" (bold formatting preferred)
   - Contains a contextual identifier (e.g., "Try This when exploring materials:")
   - Single paragraph of 50-100 words
   - Provides a specific, actionable task related to preceding content
   - Includes reflection component or documentation suggestion

3. Revise any sections that don't match this pattern while preserving the original intent.

4. Check for consistency in tone: direct, conversational, encouraging, using second-person ("you").

## Adding New "Try This" Sections

When no "Try This" section exists in a content segment that would benefit from practical application:

1. Identify theoretical concepts that would benefit from hands-on application.

2. Create a "Try This" section that follows the standard format above.

3. Position the new section immediately after the relevant theoretical content.

4. Ensure the suggested activity:
   - Requires minimal special equipment or resources
   - Can be completed in 15-30 minutes
   - Has clear connection to the preceding lesson material
   - Provides value for future reference or skill-building

5. IMPORTANT: Do not place new "Try This" sections within 2 paragraphs of any "Over to You" sections. These serve different purposes and should remain distinct.

## Converting Existing Paragraphs to "Try This" Sections

Look for paragraphs that:
1. Already contain reflection questions or practical suggestions
2. Appear at the end of theoretical sections
3. Naturally invite application rather than just conveying information
4. Would be more effective as an active learning opportunity

When converting a paragraph to a "Try This" section:
- Maintain the core concept and intent
- Restructure to follow the "Try This" format
- Make the activity more explicit and actionable
- Add a reflection component if not already present
- Ensure it doesn't create redundancy with nearby content

### Example Conversion
Original concluding paragraph:
"Have you ever spent a significant amount of time on a detailed piece of work only to receive feedback that required you to rethink a fundamental aspect? How did that impact your timeline and motivation? Iterative design aims to mitigate such situations."

Converted to "Try This":
"**Try This** when reflecting on your design process: Think about a project where you received significant revision requests after investing substantial time. Note how that impacted your timeline, motivation, and final result. Now sketch a simple flowchart showing how you could have incorporated earlier feedback points to prevent those issues. This exercise helps you visualize the practical benefits of iterative design in your own work."

## Example Format
"**Try This** when [contextual identifier]: [Specific actionable task with enough detail for completion]. [Additional step or variation if appropriate]. [Suggestion to document or reflect on the experience]. [Note about how this connects to professional practice or future learning]."
