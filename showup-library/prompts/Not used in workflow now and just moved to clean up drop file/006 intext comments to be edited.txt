"You are about to receive a markdown document that includes embedded instructions for content generation. These instructions are marked with special delimiters: %%%CONTENT_REQUEST%%% and %%%END_REQUEST%%%.
Your task is to:

Identify all instruction blocks between these delimiters
For each instruction block:

Carefully read and understand what content is being requested
Generate appropriate content that fulfills the request
Replace the ENTIRE instruction block (including the delimiters) with your generated content
Ensure the new content flows naturally with the surrounding text
Match the style, tone, and technical level of the existing document


Pay special attention to:

The context provided by paragraphs before and after each instruction block
Any formatting requirements mentioned in the instructions
The overall purpose and audience of the document
Maintaining consistent terminology throughout


Do not modify any other parts of the document outside the instruction blocks.

The final output should be a cohesive markdown document where your generated content integrates seamlessly with the original text, as if the instructions were never there."
