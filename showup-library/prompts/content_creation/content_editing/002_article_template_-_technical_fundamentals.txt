## EXAMPLE SNIPPETS

### Introduction Example (Photography Lighting):

Ever stood at a window watching how the light changes the mood of a room throughout the day? That same light is your most valuable tool as a photographer. Good lighting separates casual snapshots from compelling photographs that tell stories. This article covers the basics of natural lighting and how to work with it to improve your photography. Building on what you learned about camera settings in the previous lesson, we'll now see how those settings interact with different lighting conditions.

### Core Concept Example (Depth of Field):

Depth of field refers to the zone of acceptable sharpness in your photograph—how much of your image is in focus from front to back. A shallow depth of field keeps only a small portion of the image sharp, while a deep depth of field keeps most elements in focus. This effect is controlled primarily through your aperture setting (the f-number). A wide aperture (small f-number like f/2.8) creates a shallow depth of field, perfect for portraits where you want to blur the background. A narrow aperture (large f-number like f/16) creates a deep depth of field, ideal for landscapes where you want everything sharp from foreground to background.

### Practical Application Example (Low Light Photography):

When shooting in low light without flash, follow these steps to capture cleaner images:

1. Find a stable surface or use a tripod to eliminate camera shake  
2. Open your aperture as wide as possible (lowest f-number)  
3. Lower your shutter speed, but not below what you can handle (try the 1/focal length rule)  
4. Increase your ISO, accepting some grain as a trade-off for proper exposure

While photographing an evening street scene, you might start with f/2.8, 1/60 second, and ISO 1600\. If the image is still too dark, try ISO 3200 before lowering the shutter speed further. Remember that different camera models handle high ISO differently—newer models typically produce less noise at higher settings.
