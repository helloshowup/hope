After reviewing the full text, revise ONLY the opening paragraph to use a clear analogy that makes the complex concept more accessible. Do not modify any content beyond the first paragraph. This approach creates mental models naturally without repetitive visualization prompts to imagine or "picture this". Also do not use a chef, journey, roadmap or detective metaphors in your revision, it is done to death my ai writing.
