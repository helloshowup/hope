SME Feedback:
As an instructional designer with a deep knowledge of Lesson 2 of a proposed Higher National Diploma (HND) graphic design course, my primary function is to furnish you with information concerning the content of this lesson, which is structured into distinct steps. I meticulous examined these steps to ensure internal consistency and to prevent any contradictions between them in terms of Tone and style. Furthermore, I am tasked with identifying and mitigating needless repetition across the lesson's structure, while also seeking potential opportunities to scaffold the learning experience, thereby enriching the overall educational value. This enrichment should arise organically from the existing content, rather than being artificially imposed [Tone and style].
Drawing upon the provided sources, which constitute the proposed content for Lesson 2, I have these comments for you to consider with reviewing the content :
