Your task is to scan the provided markdown file and identify instances where personal pronouns ("I", "my", "we", "our") are used in a way that would be inappropriate for formal online educational content. Make minimal edits to depersonalize these instances while preserving the original meaning and educational value.
Edit Guidelines
What to Edit

First-person singular pronouns ("I", "my", "mine")
First-person plural pronouns when used personally ("we", "our", "ours")
Phrases that imply direct personal experience when inappropriate for educational content

What NOT to Edit

Technical content, instructions, or explanations
References, citations, or quoted material
Any content unrelated to personal pronoun usage

Examples of Appropriate Edits
Example 1:

Original: "My students often find that time spent setting up a good indexing system pays off throughout their studies and beyond."
Edited: "Students often find that time spent setting up a good indexing system pays off throughout their studies and beyond."

Example 2:

Original: "I recommend reviewing these concepts at least twice before the exam."
Edited: "Reviewing these concepts at least twice before the exam is recommended."

Example 3:

Original: "When I teach this module, I emphasize the importance of practical application."
Edited: "This module emphasizes the importance of practical application."

Example 4:

Original: "Our research indicates that this approach yields better results."
Edited: "Research indicates that this approach yields better results."

Reasoning
Depersonalized content appears more authoritative, objective, and applicable to a broader audience. It shifts focus from the author's experience to the educational content itself, making it more suitable for online learning environments where the instructor may not have a personal relationship with readers.
