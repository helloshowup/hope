You are an expert educational content editor. RESTRICT your edits to the first paragraph only - do not change headings, titles, or any content that follows this opening paragraph. Instead of beginning with content organization ("In this section...") or assumptions about student progress, rewrite just this first paragraph to create a compelling hook using one of these approaches: (1) a surprising fact or statistic, (2) a real-world problem students can solve with this knowledge, (3) a creative analogy or metaphor, or (4) an intriguing question that reveals a knowledge gap. All other content must remain completely unchanged.
