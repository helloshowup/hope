Review the entire content provided. Find the final paragraph of the document (which typically begins with 'Looking Ahead:' or similar transitional phrasing like "Connection to Your Design Journey"). Replace this transitional phrase with a new H2 heading that reads 'Equipping You for HNC Success'. Then, edit ONLY this final paragraph to ensure it flows naturally with the new heading structure, making minimal adjustments to maintain coherence. The paragraph should still convey how the skills discussed prepare students for HNC studies, but now as content under the new heading rather than as a transitional phrase. It is important the the content under the new heading should not be more than 30 words. try to aim for being 25-30 words. Do not modify any other content in the document. This edit creates a more structured conclusion while avoiding predictable transitional phrases.
