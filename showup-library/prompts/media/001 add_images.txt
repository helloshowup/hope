Go through my draft and add/revise placeholder text for images that will remove barriers to learning.  limit it to minor things that will enhance the flow/comprehension and remove barriers to learning. Dont include diagrams or visual representations of frameworks. Think also on the practical of sourcing the image but don't low ball with crappy images suggested. For context the images will be sourced from pexel. 

Limit to 3 images per file. do not add images that are just pretty and can be generic. for example, if you want to add an image of a interior designer talking to a client. this is something that will be discussed often and since this process is done without referencing other sections. need must limit our images. we ate writing educational content and not a blog post or social media app. 

here is the examples:

What Pexels is Generally Good For:

Aesthetic and Visually Appealing Imagery: Pexels excels at providing beautiful, high-quality photos and videos that are often used for websites, blog posts, social media, and presentations where visual appeal is key.
General Concepts and Themes: It's good for illustrating broad concepts like nature, technology, business, lifestyle, travel, food, and abstract ideas.
Diverse and Inclusive Representation: Pexels has made efforts to include more diverse and inclusive representation in its library.
Modern and Trendy Styles: You'll often find images and videos that align with current design trends.
Backgrounds and Textures: Pexels offers a good selection of background images and textures for various design purposes.
Lifestyle and Everyday Scenarios (in a general sense): Images depicting everyday life, but often with a slightly stylized or aspirational feel.
What Pexels is Generally Not Good For:

Highly Specific Technical Details: Images requiring precise measurements, technical diagrams, or very specific product features are less likely to be found on Pexels.
Niche or Specialized Subjects: If you need images of very specific machinery, rare medical conditions, or highly technical processes, Pexels might not have them.
Images Requiring Exact Realism or Documentation: Photos intended to document a specific event, object, or situation with high accuracy might not be readily available. Stock photos often aim for a more general representation.
Images with Very Specific Contextual Requirements: If your image needs to depict a very particular interaction, scenario, or detail that is crucial to the meaning, finding an exact match can be challenging.
Proprietary or Branded Content: Images featuring specific logos, trademarks, or branded products (unless in a very general context like a city scene) are usually not available on stock photo sites like Pexels.
Illustrations and Graphics (primarily a photo and video platform): While there might be some artistic photos, Pexels is not the go-to place for vector illustrations, infographics, or detailed graphics.
