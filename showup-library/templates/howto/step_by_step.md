## EXAMPLE EXERCISE: Key Concept Mapping

**Exercise Title:** Mapping Core Concepts

```
SETUP PHASE
Create a simple map of key ideas for {{topic}}. This helps visualize relationships and supports deeper understanding.
Ensure you have a blank sheet or digital tool ready.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

Initial Steps:
1. List the main concepts from the lesson.
2. Draw each as a separate node.

Core Exercise:
1. Connect related nodes with lines, labeling relationships.
2. Add notes on each connection explaining the link.

Challenge Extension:
1. Include secondary ideas and show their links.
2. Present your map to a peer for feedback.

SUCCESS INDICATORS
- Clear map showing major concepts and connections
- Explanations for each link

TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue:** Too many nodes cause clutter
- **Cause:** Including nonessential details
- **Solution:** Focus on primary concepts first

REFLECTION
- What new relationships did you discover?
- How might this map guide your next learning activity?
```
