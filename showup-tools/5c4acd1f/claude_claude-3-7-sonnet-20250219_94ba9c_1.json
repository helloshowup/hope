A personalised payment plan helps you develop financial planning skills while keeping your educational commitments on track. With this tool, you'll see exactly how your payments unfold over time, helping you make informed decisions about your education costs. Taking control of the financial side of your education empowers your academic journey and prepares you for handling money matters in the future.\n\n## Creating Your Personalised Payment Plan\n\nThe Payment Calculator helps you visualise and plan for the financial commitment of your educational programme. This tool transforms numbers into a clear payment schedule tailored specifically to your situation.\n\n### How to Use the Payment Calculator\n\n1. **Select Your Programme**: Choose from the dropdown menu of available programmes. Each has different costs and payment structures.\n\n2. **Enter Your Start Date**: Pick the date you plan to begin your studies. This becomes the starting point for your payment schedule.\n\n3. **Review Payment Options**: The calculator will show several payment plan choices:\n   - Full payment (with discount)\n   - Monthly payment plan (showing number of payments and amount)\n   - Quarterly payment plan (showing payment dates and amounts)\n\n4. **Personalise Your Plan**: Adjust options like down payment amount or payment frequency to see how they affect your overall schedule.\n\n5. **View Your Schedule**: The calculator will create a complete month-by-month breakdown of:\n   - When payments are due\n   - How much each payment will be\n   - How much you'll still owe after each payment\n   - How much you've paid so far\n\nThis visual breakdown gives you a clear picture of when payments are due and how each payment contributes to your education costs.\n\n## Exploring Financial Scenarios\n\nFinancial planning goes beyond creating an ideal schedule—it's about preparing for real-life situations. The scenario exploration feature helps you understand what happens in common financial circumstances.\n\n### What Happens If You Miss Payments?\n\nUse the \"Missed Payments\" scenario tool to see how your payment plan would change if you couldn't make payments for a period of time. The calculator will show:\n\n- How missed payments affect your timeline\n- Any late fees that might apply\n- Options for getting back on track\n- How to contact Excel High School about payment difficulties\n\nFor example, if you select \"What happens if I miss two payments?\", the calculator will show how your schedule adjusts, including extended completion dates and revised payment amounts.\n\n### How Does a Course Extension Change Your Budget?\n\nSometimes you might need more time to complete your courses. The \"Course Extension\" scenario tool allows you to:\n\n- See how extending your course affects monthly payments\n- Calculate any additional fees for extensions\n- Understand how extensions impact your total cost\n- Plan for adjusted payment schedules\n\nThis feature helps you decide whether an extension makes financial sense for your situation and how to budget for it.\n\n## Sharing Your Plan with Supporters\n\nHaving people who understand your financial commitments can be really helpful. The downloadable PDF feature makes it easy to share your payment plan with parents, guardians, or others who support you financially.\n\n### Creating Your Shareable Payment Plan\n\nAfter finalising your payment schedule and exploring scenarios, click \"Generate PDF\" to create a document that includes:\n\n- Complete payment schedule with dates and amounts\n- Summary of total costs and payment terms\n- Contact information for Excel High School's financial services\n- Space for notes or questions from your financial supporters\n\nThis document serves as both a reference for you and a way to discuss your educational finances with those supporting your academic journey.\n\n## Over to You\n\n1. What parts of your personal financial situation might affect your ability to stick to a payment plan? How could you prepare for these challenges?\n\n2. How would you explain the value of your educational investment to someone who is helping support your studies financially?\n\n3.
