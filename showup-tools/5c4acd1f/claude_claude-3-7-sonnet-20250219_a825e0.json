At Excel High School, we've established clear policies to ensure that your prior academic achievements are recognized while maintaining the integrity of our diploma. Understanding these transfer limits is essential for planning your educational journey with us and ensuring you meet all graduation requirements. This lesson will explain our transfer credit policy, residency requirements, and how these policies impact your path to graduation.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Maximum Credit Transfer Limit\n\nExcel High School allows students to transfer a maximum of 75% of the credits required for graduation from previous educational institutions. This policy ensures that you receive appropriate credit for your prior learning while completing enough coursework at Excel High School to meet our academic standards.\n\nFor example, if you're pursuing a standard diploma requiring 21.5 credits to graduate, you may transfer a maximum of 16.125 credits (75% of 21.5) from other accredited institutions. This means that regardless of how many credits you've earned elsewhere, Excel High School will only apply up to 75% of the required graduation credits toward your diploma.\n\nThis policy applies to all forms of transfer credit, including:\n- Credits from other accredited high schools\n- Approved homeschool credits\n- College courses that qualify for dual credit\n- Approved credit by examination options\n\nThe 75% maximum transfer limit helps ensure that your Excel High School diploma represents both your prior learning and your achievement in our academic program.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Diploma Residency Requirement\n\nComplementary to the transfer limit is Excel High School's residency requirement. To earn a diploma from Excel High School, you must complete a minimum number of credits directly through our institution. This is known as the \"residency requirement.\"\n\nFor standard diploma programs, students must complete a minimum of 5.5 to 6 credits at Excel High School, depending on the specific diploma program. These credits represent approximately 25% of the total credits required for graduation and ensure that you have demonstrated proficiency in our curriculum.\n\nThe residency requirement applies to all students seeking an Excel High School diploma, regardless of previous academic experience or grade level at enrollment. Even students who have completed most of their high school education elsewhere must fulfill this requirement to receive an Excel High School diploma.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Planning Your Academic Path\n\nUnderstanding these transfer policies is crucial for effective academic planning. Here's how to apply this knowledge to your educational journey:\n\n1. **Assess your transfer credits early:** Submit all previous transcripts for evaluation as soon as possible after enrollment. This allows our academic advisors to determine exactly how many credits will transfer.\n\n2. **Calculate your residency requirement:** Once you know how many credits will transfer, you can determine exactly how many credits you need to complete at Excel High School. Remember that you must complete at least 5.5-6 credits with us, regardless of how many transfer credits you have.\n\n3. **Create a graduation timeline:** With clear information about your transfer credits and residency requirements, you can create a realistic timeline for completing your diploma. This helps with course selection and pacing decisions.\n\n4. **Regular progress monitoring:** Check your progress regularly to ensure you're on track to meet both the overall credit requirements and the residency requirement.\n\nFor the most current and detailed information about Excel High School's transfer credit policies, please refer to the Residency Policy section in the Student Handbook, which is available in your student portal.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1.
