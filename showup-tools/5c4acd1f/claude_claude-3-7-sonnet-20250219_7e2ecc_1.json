The LearnStage Learning Management System (LMS) will be your digital classroom throughout your educational journey with us. Just as you would need to know where to find classrooms, textbooks, and resources in a physical school, understanding how to navigate LearnStage is essential for your success. This quick tour will help you become comfortable with the key features of the platform so you can focus on what really mattersâ€”your learning journey.\n\n### Core Concept 1: The LearnStage Dashboard - Your Command Center\n\nThe LearnStage dashboard is your starting point for all academic activities at Excel High School. When you log in, you'll see a clean, organized interface designed to give you quick access to everything you need.\n\nAt the top of the dashboard, you'll find the main navigation menu with tabs for \"Courses,\" \"Calendar,\" \"Messages,\" and \"Help.\" The \"Courses\" section displays all your currently enrolled courses as colorful tiles. Each tile shows the course name, your current progress percentage, and the most recent activity date. Simply click on any course tile to enter that specific course environment.\n\nOn the right side of the dashboard, you'll notice the \"Announcements\" panel where Excel High School posts important updates about system maintenance, upcoming events, or school-wide information. Check this area regularly to stay informed about time-sensitive information.\n\nThe left sidebar contains your personal navigation menu with links to your profile, grades, and account settings. This is where you can update your contact information, notification preferences, and password. The sidebar remains accessible throughout the platform, allowing you to quickly jump between different areas of LearnStage without returning to the main dashboard.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Tracking Your Academic Journey\n\nLearnStage includes helpful progress tracking tools that help you monitor your academic advancement. Within each course, the progress tracker provides a visual representation of your journey through the course material.\n\nThe main progress bar at the top of each course shows your overall completion percentage. As you complete lessons, assignments, and assessments, this bar automatically updates to reflect your progress. This gives you a quick understanding of how far you've come and what remains ahead.\n\nFor more detailed information, navigate to the \"Progress\" tab within any course. Here, you'll find a breakdown of your course activities, including:\n- Completed lessons (marked with green checkmarks)\n- Upcoming assignments with due dates\n- Recent assessment scores\n- Time spent in each course section\n\nThe progress tracker also highlights any overdue assignments in red, helping you prioritize your work. You can use the calendar integration to set personal deadlines and create study schedules that align with your course requirements.\n\nA particularly helpful feature is the \"Pace Guide,\" which compares your current progress to the recommended timeline for course completion. This helps you determine if you're on track to finish by your target date or if you need to adjust your study schedule.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Working with Digital Textbooks\n\nExcel High School courses use digital textbooks that offer advantages over traditional print materials. To access your digital textbooks, navigate to the \"Resources\" tab within any course, then select \"Textbooks\" from the dropdown menu.\n\nDigital textbooks in LearnStage include several interactive features:\n- Searchable text that allows you to quickly find specific topics or terms\n- Highlighting and note-taking tools that save automatically to your account\n- Embedded videos and interactive diagrams that bring concepts to life\n- Adjustable text size and contrast settings for improved readability\n\nWhen reading your digital textbook, use the table of contents panel on the left side to navigate between chapters and sections. The bookmark feature lets you save important pages for quick reference later. As you highlight text or add notes, these annotations are collected in your personal study guide, accessible from the \"My Notes\" tab.\n\nFor offline access, you can download specific chapters or entire textbooks using the download icon in the upper right corner of the textbook viewer. This is particularly useful if you anticipate being without internet access but want to continue your studies.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Take a moment to explore your LearnStage dashboard.
