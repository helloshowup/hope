By setting clear, achievable goals, you create a roadmap for success. Let's break down how to set one academic goal and one career-related goal:\n\nAcademic Goal:\n- Make it specific: Instead of \"improve grades,\" try \"raise my math grade from a B to an A by the end of the semester\"\n- Ensure it's measurable: How will you track progress? (e.g., weekly quiz scores, monthly grade checks)\n- Set a timeline: When do you want to achieve this goal?\n\nCareer-Related Goal:\n- Base it on your interest inventory results: If you showed interest in healthcare, your goal might be \"shadow a nurse for a day by the end of the school year\"\n- Make it action-oriented: \"Research three colleges offering programs in my field of interest by next month\"\n- Align it with your academic goals: How does this career goal connect to your current studies?\n\nYour Success Coach can help you refine these goals and develop strategies to achieve them. Remember, goals can be adjusted as you learn and grow â€“ the important thing is to have a direction and take steps towards it.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. After completing the interest inventory, what career cluster surprised you the most, and why?\n2.
