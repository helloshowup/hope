I work part-time (less than 30 hours per week)\nC. I work full-time (30-40 hours per week)\nD. I work more than 40 hours per week\n\n### Question 4: What other major commitments do you have alongside school?\nA. Few or no other major commitments\nB. Some family responsibilities or activities\nC. Significant family responsibilities or extracurricular activities\nD. Multiple major commitments (family care, other programs, etc.)\n\n### Question 5: How quickly do you hope to complete your diploma or courses?\nA. As fast as possible - accelerated timeline\nB. Standard pace - graduate on a normal timeline\nC. Flexible pace - may take longer than average\nD. Very flexible - timeline is not a primary concern\n\n### Results and Recommendations\n\n**Mostly A's: Full-Time Enrollment Recommended**\nYou appear to have the time availability and focus to succeed as a full-time student. With 25+ hours per week dedicated to coursework, you can maintain the recommended pace of completing 1-2 courses per month and graduate in 12-18 months. Full-time enrollment would support your goal of completing your education efficiently.\n\n**Mostly B's: Full-Time Enrollment with Balanced Approach**\nYou likely have the capacity for full-time enrollment but should be mindful of your other commitments. Full-time students are expected to complete 5-6 credits per semester. Consider starting with this pace and adjusting if needed. Remember that Excel High School offers flexibility within the full-time framework.\n\n**Mostly C's: Part-Time Enrollment Recommended**\nYour current life circumstances suggest part-time enrollment might be the best fit. Part-time students typically complete 2-4 credits per semester, which aligns well with your available time and existing commitments. This status allows you to make steady progress while balancing other important aspects of your life.\n\n**Mostly D's: Part-Time Enrollment with Extended Timeline**\nWith your significant outside commitments, part-time enrollment with a flexible, extended timeline would likely be most sustainable. This approach allows you to take 1-2 courses at a time and progress at a pace that accommodates your busy schedule. Remember that Excel High School allows up to 12 months per course, providing the flexibility you need.\n\n**Mixed Results:**\nIf your answers were mixed across categories, consider the following:\n- Which aspects of your life are most fixed (work, family) vs. flexible?\n- Would starting with part-time and potentially increasing to full-time work better?\n- What are the financial implications of each option for your situation?\n- Have you discussed your educational plans with those who might be affected (family, employer)?\n\n### Remember:\n- Full-time enrollment requires commitment to completing 5-6 credits per semester\n- Part-time enrollment typically involves 2-4 credits per semester\n- Both options provide flexibility in when and how you complete your coursework\n- You can adjust your enrollment status if your circumstances change\n- Excel High School's academic advisors are available to help you make the best decision for your situation\n\nContact an Excel High School academic advisor for personalized guidance if you're still unsure about which enrollment status is right for you.\n</educational_content>"}
