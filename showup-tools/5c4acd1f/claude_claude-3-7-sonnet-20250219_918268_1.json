But how many of these credits will count toward your Excel diploma? Understanding transfer credit policies is essential for planning your path to graduation. This lesson covers the key limits you need to know - including how many credits you can transfer in and how many you must complete with Excel High School. Knowing these rules now will help you create a realistic timeline for earning your diploma and avoid surprises later in your academic journey.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Maximum Transfer Credit Allowance\n\nExcel High School allows you to transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for your diploma. This means your previous academic work is recognized while ensuring you complete enough coursework with Excel High School to earn a diploma.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice:\n- If your diploma program requires 24 credits, you can transfer a maximum of 18 credits\n- If your diploma program requires 21.5 credits, you can transfer a maximum of 16.125 credits\n\nThis 75% limit applies to all previously earned credits, including those from:\n- Public or private high schools\n- Other online schools\n- Homeschool programs (with proper documentation)\n- Approved correspondence courses\n\nEven if you've completed more than 75% of your high school credits elsewhere, you'll still need to meet the residency requirement to earn an Excel High School diploma.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Diploma Residency Requirement\n\nThe residency requirement is the flip side of the transfer limit. To earn an Excel High School diploma, you must complete a minimum of 5.5 to 6 credits directly through Excel High School, depending on your specific program.\n\nThis means:\n- You must complete approximately 25% of your total diploma requirements at Excel High School\n- For a 24-credit diploma program, you'll need to earn at least 6 credits with Excel High School\n- For a 21.5-credit diploma program, you'll need to earn at least 5.5 credits with Excel High School\n\nThe residency requirement ensures that every graduate has demonstrated proficiency in the curriculum and has been fully assessed according to Excel High School's academic standards. This requirement maintains the integrity and value of your diploma.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Planning Your Academic Path\n\nNow that you understand these policies, you can effectively plan your academic journey:\n\n1. **Get your credits evaluated**: Submit all your previous transcripts as soon as possible after enrollment so the academic team can determine which credits will transfer.\n\n2. **Do the math**: Once you know your transferable credits, calculate how many more you need to complete. Remember that you must earn at least 5.5-6 credits at Excel High School, regardless of how many transfer credits you have.\n\n3. **Create a timeline**: Based on your remaining requirements, develop a realistic schedule for completing your diploma. Consider how many courses you can handle at once based on your other commitments.\n\n4. **Meet with your advisor**: Your academic advisor can help you understand how these policies apply to your specific situation and help you create a personalized graduation plan.\n\nFor detailed information about these policies, please refer to the Residency Policy section in the Excel High School Student Handbook in your student portal.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1.
