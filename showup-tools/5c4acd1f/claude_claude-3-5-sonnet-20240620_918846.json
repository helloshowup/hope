From social media to online shopping, we share a lot of personal information on the internet. While this connectivity brings many benefits, it also comes with risks. Just as you lock your front door to keep your home safe, it's crucial to take steps to protect your digital identity. This lesson will equip you with practical strategies to keep your personal information secure online, helping you navigate the digital world safely and responsibly as an Excel High School student.\n\n### Core Concept 1: Password Safety\n\nCreating strong, unique passwords is your first line of defense in protecting your online accounts. Here are some key tips:\n\n1. Length matters: Use passwords that are at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are harder to crack.\n\n2. Mix it up: Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, \"I<3Excel2023!\" is stronger than \"iheartexcel\".\n\n3. Avoid personal information: Don't use easily guessable information like birthdates, names, or common words.\n\n4. Use unique passwords: Never reuse passwords across different accounts. If one account is compromised, the others remain safe.\n\n5. Consider a password manager: These tools can generate and securely store complex passwords for all your accounts.\n\n6. Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, like a code sent to your phone.\n\nRemember, your Excel High School account password protects your educational records and communications. Treat it with the same care you would give to your bank account password.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Protecting Personal Data Online\n\nBeyond password safety, there are several ways to safeguard your personal information when browsing the internet:\n\n1. Be wary of public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (like banking or school) on public networks. If you must, use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for added security.\n\n2. Check for HTTPS: When sharing any personal information online, ensure the website's URL starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon. This indicates a secure connection.\n\n3. Be cautious with sharing: Think twice before posting personal information on social media. Once online, it can be difficult to completely remove.\n\n4. Update regularly: Keep your devices and applications up-to-date. Updates often include important security patches.\n\n5. Use privacy settings: Familiarize yourself with and use the privacy settings on social media platforms and other online accounts.\n\n6. Be alert to phishing: Be skeptical of emails or messages asking for personal information. Legitimate organizations like Excel High School will never ask for sensitive data via email.\n\n7. Secure your devices: Use screen locks, fingerprint scanners, or facial recognition on all your devices to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you significantly reduce the risk of your personal data falling into the wrong hands.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Excel High School's Acceptable Use Policy\n\nExcel High School's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is designed to keep students safe online while using school resources. Key elements related to online safety include:\n\n1. Responsible use: Students are expected to use Excel High School's online resources responsibly and ethically. This means not engaging in cyberbullying, accessing inappropriate content, or using school accounts for non-educational purposes.\n\n2. Privacy protection: Students should never share their Excel High School account credentials with others. This protects both your personal information and the integrity of the school's systems.\n\n3. Digital citizenship: The AUP encourages students to be good digital citizens, respecting others' privacy and intellectual property rights online.\n\n4. Reporting concerns: If you encounter any online safety issues or witness violations of the AUP, report them to school staff immediately.\n\n5. Consequences: Violations of the AUP can result in disciplinary action, including loss of technology privileges.\n\n6. Staff oversight: Excel High School staff may monitor online activities on school accounts to ensure compliance with the AUP and protect students' safety.\n\nUnderstanding and following the AUP helps create a safe online learning environment for all Excel High School students.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Think about your current online habits. What's one change you could make today to better protect your personal information online?\n\n2. How might sharing too much personal information on social media potentially impact your future education or career opportunities?\n\n3. In what ways does Excel High School's Acceptable Use Policy benefit you as a student? How does it relate to broader internet safety practices?\n\n### Check Your Understanding\n\n1. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a strong password?\n   A. At least 12 characters long\n   B. Includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters\n   C. Uses your birthdate for easy remembering\n   D. Contains symbols and numbers\n\n2. When using public Wi-Fi, what's the safest way to access sensitive accounts?\n   A. Only use https:// websites\n   B. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)\n   C. Log out immediately after use\n   D. Only access them on your smartphone\n\n3.
