When choosing an online high school, understanding its accreditation status is crucial for ensuring your diploma will be recognized by colleges, universities, employers, and the military. Excel High School maintains rigorous accreditation through respected regional and national bodies, demonstrating our commitment to educational excellence and continuous improvement. This overview will explain our accreditation credentials and why they matter to our students and families.\n\n## Regional Accreditation: Cognia\n\nExcel High School is proudly accredited by Cognia, one of the most respected educational accrediting bodies in the United States. Cognia was formed through the merger of three regional accrediting organizations, creating a unified system of educational quality measurement that spans across the country.\n\n### The Three Regional Bodies of Cognia\n\nCognia represents the consolidation of three formerly separate regional accreditation commissions:\n\n1. **NCA CASI (North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement)**: This organization historically served schools in the north central United States, including states such as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\n2. **SACS CASI (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement)**: SACS CASI traditionally accredited educational institutions across the southern United States, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.\n\n3. **NWAC (Northwest Accreditation Commission)**: This commission served schools in the northwestern region of the United States, including Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.\n\nCognia's unified approach means that Excel High School's accreditation status is recognized nationwide, providing our students with credentials that meet the highest standards regardless of where they may live or move in the future.\n\n### What Cognia Accreditation Means for Students\n\nCognia accreditation signals that Excel High School:\n- Adheres to rigorous quality standards for digital learning\n- Undergoes regular external reviews and evaluations\n- Maintains qualified faculty and appropriate curriculum\n- Demonstrates continuous improvement in educational practices\n- Issues diplomas recognized by post-secondary institutions nationwide\n\n## Systems Accreditation by Middle States Association\n\nIn addition to our Cognia credentials, Excel High School holds prestigious systems accreditation through the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA). The MSA is one of the oldest accrediting bodies in the United States, with a history dating back to 1887.\n\n### What Makes MSA Systems Accreditation Significant\n\nSystems accreditation represents a comprehensive evaluation of an educational institution's entire operation. Unlike program-specific accreditation, systems accreditation examines:\n\n- Overall institutional effectiveness\n- Quality of curriculum across all subject areas\n- Strategic planning and governance structures\n- Student support services and resources\n- Assessment systems and continuous improvement processes\n\nThis additional layer of accreditation underscores Excel High School's commitment to excellence at every level of operation. MSA systems accreditation is particularly valuable for students who may apply to competitive colleges and universities, as it represents adherence to stringent quality standards recognized throughout the educational community.\n\n### How MSA Accreditation Benefits Excel High School Students\n\nStudents enrolled at Excel High School benefit from MSA accreditation through:\n- Enhanced recognition of their diploma by colleges and universities\n- Assurance of curriculum alignment with college preparatory standards\n- Access to an education meeting internationally recognized benchmarks\n- Confidence that their school undergoes regular external validation\n- Evidence that their school is committed to continuous improvement\n\n## Verification of Accreditation Status\n\nExcel High School's accreditation status can be independently verified through the official websites of Cognia and the Middle States Association. We encourage prospective students and their families to research these organizations to understand the rigor of their standards and the significance of their endorsement of our educational programs.\n\nOur commitment to maintaining these prestigious accreditations reflects our dedication to providing students with a high-quality online education that opens doors to future opportunities in higher education and careers.\n\n[Note: Infographic of accreditation logos to be inserted here.
