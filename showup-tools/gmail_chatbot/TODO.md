# Project TODOs

This file tracks pending improvements and feature ideas for the Gmail Chatbot. Contributors are encouraged to append new items here as they arise.

- **Auto Gmail search after notebook miss** – automatically perform a Gmail search when the notebook lookup returns no results.
- **Notebook summary command/button** – provide a single command or UI button that summarizes the notebook contents.
- **Expanded triage heuristics** – add more sophisticated heuristics for deciding when to escalate or categorize conversations.
