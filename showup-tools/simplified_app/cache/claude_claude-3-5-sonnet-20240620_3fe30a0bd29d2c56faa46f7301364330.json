However, it's important to understand that as a non-public, tuition-funded school, EHS has specific policies regarding student support and accommodations. This lesson will clarify what EHS can and cannot provide in terms of support services, helping you set realistic expectations for your educational journey with us. Understanding these policies is crucial for making informed decisions about your education and ensuring you can fully engage with our curriculum.\n\n### Core Concept 1: EHS's Discretionary-Support Policy\n\nExcel High School operates under a discretionary-support policy, which means that while we strive to accommodate various learning needs, we have the flexibility to determine which accommodations are feasible within our online learning environment. This policy allows us to consider each student's situation individually and make decisions that best serve the student while maintaining the integrity of our educational programs.\n\nOur approach to support is guided by several key principles:\n\n1. Equity: We aim to provide fair and equal access to education for all students.\n2. Feasibility: Accommodations must be practical to implement in an online setting.\n3. Academic integrity: Support measures should not compromise the essential learning outcomes of our courses.\n4. Student independence: We encourage students to develop self-reliance and independent learning skills.\n\nWhen considering accommodations, EHS evaluates each request on a case-by-case basis. We take into account the student's documented needs, the nature of the online learning environment, and our capacity to provide effective support.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Examples of Accommodations Considered\n\nWhile EHS cannot guarantee all accommodations, we do consider a range of support measures that are compatible with our online learning model. Some examples of accommodations that may be considered include:\n\n1. Extended time: Allowing additional time for assignments or tests when appropriate.\n2. Modified assignment formats: Offering alternative ways to demonstrate knowledge, such as written responses instead of multiple-choice questions.\n3. Text-to-speech software: Providing access to tools that can read digital text aloud.\n4. Simplified instructions: Offering clearer, more concise directions for assignments when needed.\n5. Visual aids: Incorporating more diagrams, charts, or other visual elements to support learning.\n6. Frequent breaks: Allowing students to divide their work into smaller segments with built-in break times.\n\nIt's important to note that these accommodations are considered on an individual basis and may not be applicable or available in all situations. Students or parents should discuss specific needs with EHS staff to determine what accommodations can be reasonably provided.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Services Not Offered by EHS\n\nWhile EHS strives to support diverse learning needs, there are certain services we cannot provide due to the nature of our online learning environment. It's crucial for students and families to understand these limitations when considering enrollment. Services not offered by EHS include:\n\n1. In-person paraprofessionals: We cannot provide one-on-one in-person support due to our online format.\n2. Curriculum modification: Our courses maintain specific learning outcomes that cannot be substantially altered.\n3. Real-time translation services: We do not offer live language interpretation during asynchronous learning.\n4. Specialized therapy services: Physical, occupational, or speech therapy cannot be provided through our platform.\n5. Individualized daily check-ins: Our model does not support daily one-on-one progress monitoring.\n6. Hardware provision: We do not supply physical devices or assistive technology equipment.\n\n### Self-Paced Learning and Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)\n\nExcel High School's self-paced, asynchronous learning model aligns well with the concept of Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) in special education. LRE emphasizes that students with disabilities should be educated in settings as close to the regular classroom as possible. Our online platform inherently offers several advantages in this regard:\n\n1. Flexibility: Students can work at their own pace, reducing time pressure and allowing for natural breaks.\n2. Reduced distractions: The home learning environment can be tailored to minimize sensory overload.\n3. Individualized progression: Learners can spend more time on challenging concepts without holding back peers.\n4. Privacy: Students can access accommodations discreetly without drawing attention in a physical classroom.\n\nBy offering a self-paced model, EHS provides an environment where many students, including those with various learning needs, can thrive without extensive modifications to the core curriculum. This approach allows for a balance between support and independence, preparing students for future academic and professional endeavors.\n\n### Over to You:\n\n1. Reflect on your own learning needs. What types of accommodations, if any, do you think would be most beneficial in an online learning environment?\n2. How might the self-paced nature of EHS courses benefit different types of learners? Consider both students with and without specific learning challenges.\n3. Think about the concept of Least Restrictive Environment. How does online learning at EHS potentially offer a less restrictive environment compared to traditional classrooms for some students?\n\n### Summary\n\nExcel High School is committed to providing quality education while considering the diverse needs of our students. Our discretionary-support policy allows us to offer certain accommodations that are compatible with our online learning environment, such as extended time and modified assignment formats. However, it's important to understand that some services, like in-person support or curriculum modification, are not available due to the nature of our program. Our self-paced, asynchronous model aligns with the principle of Least Restrictive Environment, offering flexibility and individualized learning opportunities. By understanding what EHS can and cannot provide, students and families can make informed decisions about their education and set realistic expectations for their learning journey with us.\n\n</educational_content>"}
