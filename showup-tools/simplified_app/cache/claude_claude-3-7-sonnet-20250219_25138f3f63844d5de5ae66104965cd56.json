At Excel High School, we offer flexible payment arrangements to accommodate different financial situations, but it's equally important to understand the refund policies that protect both students and the institution. Whether you're planning to pay in full or spread payments over time, this information will help you avoid unexpected financial issues and make informed decisions about your educational investment.\n\n## Payment Options at Excel High School\n\n### Monthly Installment Plans vs. Full Payment\n\nExcel High School offers two primary payment methods for most programs:\n\n**Interest-Free Monthly Installment Plans**\n* Divides tuition into manageable monthly payments\n* No interest charges or hidden fees\n* Provides financial flexibility for families and students\n* Available for most standard programs\n* Payments are spread evenly over a predetermined period\n\n**Full Payment Option**\n* Complete payment of tuition upfront\n* May qualify for certain discounts (varies by program)\n* Eliminates monthly payment responsibilities\n* Simplifies financial planning for the academic year\n* Preferred by some families for budgeting purposes\n\n**Important Note:** The Adult High School Diploma Program does not offer the monthly installment plan option.

Remember that most programs offer both full payment and interest-free installment options (except the Adult program), automatic payments are required for installment plans, and missing three payments results in suspended access. While Excel provides a 10-day window for refunds (minus a 3% fee) and guarantees credit transfers, no refunds are available after the initial 10-day period. State-funded programs follow separate guidelines. Being aware of these policies helps you plan appropriately and avoid unexpected financial complications during your educational journey.\n</educational_content>"}
