A Proof of Enrollment (POE) letter is an official document that confirms you're actively enrolled in your academic program. This lesson explains what qualifies as an active student, the 30-day rule for POE letters, and provides clear instructions on how to request this important documentation.\n\n## Active Full-Time Student Status and the 30-Day Rule\n\n### What Qualifies as an \"Active Full-Time Student\"?\n\nAt Excel High School, an active full-time student is defined by the following criteria:\n\n1. You must be **currently enrolled** in an Excel High School program\n2. Your account must be in **good standing** (no outstanding financial obligations)\n3. You must have **logged into your courses** within the past 30 days\n4. You must have **submitted academic work** within the past 30 days\n\nThe 30-day activity requirement is particularly important. Simply being enrolled without active participation is not enough to qualify for a POE letter.\n\n### Why the 30-Day Rule Matters\n\nThe 30-day rule exists for several important reasons:\n\n- **Accuracy and integrity**: It ensures that Excel High School only verifies active student status for those genuinely participating in their education\n- **External requirements**: Many organizations (like insurance companies and government agencies) specifically require verification that you are actively participating in your educational program\n- **Educational progress**: Regular engagement is essential for academic success in an online learning environment\n\n**Example Scenario:**\nEmma needs a POE letter for her car insurance discount. She has been consistently completing assignments and logging into her courses several times each week. When she requests a POE letter, she easily qualifies under the 30-day rule. However, if Emma had taken a two-month break from her studies without logging in, she would need to resume active participation before becoming eligible for a POE letter.\n\n## How to Request a Proof of Enrollment Letter\n\nRequesting your Proof of Enrollment letter is a straightforward process through the LearnStage Help Desk. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Log in to your LearnStage account** and ensure you've been active within the past 30 days\n2. **Navigate to the Help Desk** by clicking on the \"Help\" or \"Support\" option in your dashboard\n3. **Create a new support ticket** by selecting \"New Ticket\" or \"Create Request\"\n4. **Select \"Proof of Enrollment Request\"** from the category dropdown menu\n5. **In your request, include**:\n   - Your full legal name as it should appear on the letter\n   - Your student ID number\n   - The purpose of the letter (insurance, driver's license, etc.)\n   - Any specific information that needs to be included\n   - Where the letter should be sent (your email or a third party's email/address)\n   - Any deadline by which you need the letter\n6. **Submit your ticket** and wait for confirmation\n\n### Processing Time and Delivery\n\nOnce submitted, Proof of Enrollment requests are typically processed within 1-2 business days. The letter will be delivered according to your specifications, either:\n\n- Emailed directly to you as a PDF attachment\n- Emailed to a third party you've specified\n- Attached to your support ticket for future reference\n\n**Important Note:** If you need your POE letter sent directly to a third party (such as an insurance company), be sure to include the recipient's name, email address, and any reference numbers in your request.\n\n## Over to You\n\n1. Think about your own course activity patterns. Based on the 30-day rule, would you currently qualify for a Proof of Enrollment letter? What steps might you need to take to ensure you maintain eligibility?\n\n2. What are some situations in your life where you might need to provide proof of your enrollment at Excel High School?

If they have been enrolled for less than 30 days\n   - B. If they have not logged in or submitted work in their courses for more than 30 days\n   - C.
