This second part of your Next Steps Checklist focuses on creating a sustainable study routine and ensuring your enrollment file is complete. Taking these steps now will help you stay on track in your online courses and avoid administrative delays that could impact your progress.\n\n## Setting Weekly Study Targets\n\n### Why Weekly Targets Matter\nIn an online learning environment without daily classroom attendance, creating your own structure is essential for success. Students who establish regular study patterns are much more likely to complete their courses on time and achieve better grades.\n\n### Creating Your Study Schedule\nCompleting 1-2 lessons per course each week allows you to make steady progress while maintaining quality work. Here's how to create an effective weekly study plan:\n\n1. **Find your best study times**: Are you more focused in the morning, afternoon, or evening?\n2. **Block specific study sessions**: Choose exact days and times for studying each course\n3. **Be realistic**: Consider your other responsibilities and set targets you can consistently achieve\n4. **Start small**: Begin with 1 lesson per week per course and adjust as you establish your routine\n\n### Setting Up Calendar Reminders\nCalendar reminders serve as your personal accountability system. Here's how to set them up effectively:\n\n1. Choose a calendar system you already use regularly (phone, computer, or physical planner)\n2. Create recurring events for each study session with specific course names\n3. Set alerts 15-30 minutes before your scheduled study time\n4. Include notes about which specific lesson you plan to work on\n5. Add a weekly review reminder to check your overall progress\n\nMost high school students find success using digital calendar apps like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar since these sync across devices and send notifications. The key is selecting a system you'll actually use consistently.\n\n## Completing Your Enrollment File\n\n### Required Documentation Checklist\nVerify that you have uploaded:\n- **Official transcripts** from all previous schools\n- **Government-issued photo ID** (driver's license, passport, etc.)\n- **Proof of residence** (if required for your program)\n- **Enrollment agreement** with all signatures\n- **Payment information** or financial aid documentation\n\nHaving a complete enrollment file ensures that:\n- Your academic records are properly maintained\n- Your credits are accurately recorded\n- Your diploma or transcript requests can be processed without delay\n- You have access to all student services\n\n### How to Upload Missing Documents\nIf you're missing any required documentation:\n1. Log in to your Excel High School student portal\n2. Navigate to the \"My Documents\" section\n3. Select \"Upload Document\"\n4. Choose the appropriate document type from the dropdown menu\n5. Upload your file (PDF, JPG, or PNG formats work best)\n6. Verify the upload was successful\n\nIf you're unsure which documents you still need to submit, contact your Student Services Advisor for a personalized list of any remaining requirements.\n\n## Taking Action Now\n\nThe sooner you complete these next steps, the more quickly you can fully engage with your Excel High School experience.
