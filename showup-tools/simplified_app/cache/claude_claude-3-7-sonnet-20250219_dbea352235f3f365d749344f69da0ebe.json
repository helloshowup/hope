Understanding how to properly request a Proof of Enrollment (POE) letter and knowing the eligibility requirements will help you obtain this important documentation efficiently. This lesson explains our definition of an active full-time student, the 30-day rule for POE letters, and provides clear instructions on how to submit your request through the LearnStage Help Desk.\n\n## Active Full-Time Student Status and the 30-Day Rule\n\n### What Qualifies as an Active Full-Time Student?\n\nAt Excel High School, an active full-time student is defined by the following criteria:\n\n1. You must be **currently enrolled** in an Excel High School program\n2. Your account must be in **good standing** (financially current)\n3. You must be making **satisfactory academic progress**\n4. You must have **logged into your account** and **completed coursework** within the past 30 days\n\nThe 30-day activity requirement is particularly important. To maintain your active status, you need to demonstrate consistent engagement with your coursework. Simply logging in is not sufficient—you must actually complete and submit academic work.\n\n### The 30-Day Rule for Proof of Enrollment Letters\n\nExcel High School adheres to a strict 30-day rule regarding Proof of Enrollment letters:\n\n- POE letters will only be issued to students who have been **active within the past 30 calendar days**\n- Activity is defined as completing and submitting coursework within your program\n- Login activity alone does not satisfy the requirement\n- If you have not submitted coursework in the past 30 days, your POE request will be denied until you resume active participation\n\nThis policy exists to ensure that our verification of enrollment accurately reflects genuine student engagement. Many organizations that request proof of enrollment (such as insurance companies or government agencies) expect verification that you are actively participating in your educational program, not merely registered.\n\n### What Your POE Letter Includes\n\nWhen issued, your Proof of Enrollment letter will contain:\n\n- Your full legal name\n- Your date of birth\n- Your current enrollment status\n- The program you're enrolled in\n- Your anticipated graduation date (if applicable)\n- The date the letter was issued\n- Official school signature and contact information\n\n## Requesting Your POE Letter Through LearnStage Help Desk\n\nWhen you need a Proof of Enrollment letter, follow these steps to submit your request through the LearnStage Help Desk:\n\n1. **Access the Help Desk**: \n   - Log in to your LearnStage account\n   - Locate and click on the \"Help\" button in the main navigation menu\n   - Select \"Contact Support\" or \"Submit a Ticket\"\n\n2. **Create Your Request**:\n   - Choose \"Proof of Enrollment Letter\" from the dropdown menu of request types\n   - Complete all required fields in the request form\n   - Be sure to include:\n     * Your full legal name (as you want it to appear on the letter)\n     * Your date of birth\n     * The specific purpose of the letter (insurance, driver's license, etc.)\n     * Where the letter needs to be sent (your email, directly to an organization, etc.)\n\n3. **Submit and Wait**:\n   - Click \"Submit Ticket\" to send your request\n   - Allow 1-2 business days for processing\n   - You will receive a notification when your POE letter is ready\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Plan ahead**: Request your POE letter at least 3-5 business days before you need it\n- **Stay active**: If you haven't completed coursework recently, submit some assignments before requesting your letter\n- **Be specific**: If the organization requiring your POE needs specific language or information included, mention this in your request\n- **Check accuracy**: Once you receive your POE letter, verify all information is correct before sending it to the requesting organization\n\n## Over to You\n\n1.
