That's why we've developed the ElevatED Coaching program, a tiered system designed to provide you with the guidance and tools you need to succeed. In this lesson, we'll explore the different coaching tiers, compare their benefits, and show you how to connect with your Success Coach. By understanding and utilizing these resources, you'll be better equipped to navigate your educational journey and maximize your potential.\n\n### Core Concept 1: ElevatED Coaching Tiers\n\nExcel High School's ElevatED Coaching program is structured into three tiers: Launch, Climb, and Summit. Each tier is designed to meet different levels of student needs and aspirations.\n\n1. Launch Tier: This is the foundation of our coaching program. It's ideal for self-motivated students who need occasional support. Launch provides access to a Success Coach for basic academic guidance and goal-setting.\n\n2. Climb Tier: For students seeking more regular interaction and support, the Climb tier offers increased coaching sessions and additional resources. This tier is perfect for those who want to accelerate their progress or need more consistent accountability.\n\n3. Summit Tier: Our most comprehensive coaching package, Summit is designed for students aiming for exceptional achievement. It offers frequent one-on-one coaching, advanced career planning, and personalized strategies for academic excellence.\n\nEach tier builds upon the previous one, offering progressively more intensive support and resources. The goal is to provide a flexible system that can adapt to your changing needs throughout your academic journey at Excel High School.\n\n### Core Concept 2: Comparing Tier Benefits\n\nTo help you understand the differences between each ElevatED coaching tier, let's examine their key benefits using an interactive graphic:\n\n[Interactive Graphic: A table comparing the three tiers side-by-side. Each row represents a benefit (e.g., coaching sessions, career planning tools, study skills workshops), with checkmarks or specific quantities indicating what's included in each tier. The graphic is interactive, allowing students to click on each benefit for a more detailed explanation.]\n\nKey comparisons:\n- Coaching Sessions: Launch offers monthly check-ins, Climb provides bi-weekly sessions, and Summit includes weekly one-on-one coaching.\n- Career Planning: Basic tools for Launch, intermediate resources for Climb, and comprehensive planning and networking opportunities for Summit.\n- Academic Support: All tiers offer access to tutoring, with increasing hours and specialized support as you move up the tiers.\n- Study Skills: Workshops and resources increase in frequency and depth from Launch to Summit.\n\nThis visual comparison allows you to easily see how each tier builds upon the previous one, helping you choose the level of support that best fits your needs and goals.\n\n### Core Concept 3: Contacting Your Success Coach\n\nKnowing how to reach out to your Success Coach is crucial for making the most of the ElevatED program. At Excel High School, we use a Help Desk ticket system to ensure efficient communication and support.\n\nTo contact your Success Coach:\n1. Log into your Excel High School student portal\n2. Navigate to the \"Help Desk\" section\n3. Click on \"Create New Ticket\"\n4. Select \"Success Coach\" from the department dropdown\n5. Choose a relevant category (e.g., \"Academic Planning,\" \"Career Guidance\")\n6. Write a clear subject line and detailed description of your query or request\n7. Submit the ticket\n\nHere's an example of a well-written Help Desk ticket:\n\nSubject: Request for Study Skills Guidance\nDescription: Hello, I'm struggling with time management for my Algebra II course. Could we schedule a session to discuss effective study strategies for math? I'm particularly interested in learning how to balance daily practice with long-term exam preparation. Thank you!\n\nYour Success Coach will typically respond within 24-48 hours, depending on your coaching tier.
