As an online student at Excel High School, you have flexibility in when and where you complete your coursework, but maintaining clear communication about your availability is still essential. This lesson explores the importance of notifying the school before planned absences and provides you with a practical commitment checklist to help you develop this essential habit. By establishing clear communication practices now, you'll build a foundation for academic success throughout your educational journey and develop valuable skills for your future college and career paths.\n\n### Understanding Planned Absences in an Online Environment\n\nWhile the flexibility of online learning at Excel High School means you can study from anywhere at any time, there may still be periods when you cannot engage with your coursework at all. A planned absence is any period during which you know in advance that you will be unable to log in, complete assignments, or participate in required activities.\n\nExamples of planned absences include:\n- Family vacations or travel\n- Medical procedures or appointments\n- Religious or cultural observances\n- Significant family events\n- Extended periods without internet access\n- Work-related commitments (for working students)\n\nEven in an asynchronous learning environment, extended periods without academic engagement can impact your progress and may affect your ability to complete courses within expected timeframes. Additionally, if instructors or staff are expecting to hear from you—perhaps regarding feedback on an assignment or participation in a scheduled check-in—knowing about your absence in advance helps them adjust their expectations and support accordingly.\n\n### Benefits of Advance Notification\n\nNotifying Excel High School before a planned absence is more than just a procedural requirement—it's a crucial component of your academic success strategy. When you inform the school about upcoming absences, you enable your instructors to provide appropriate accommodations, adjust deadlines if necessary, and ensure you don't miss critical learning opportunities.\n\nThis proactive communication offers several important benefits:\n\n**Maintains Academic Momentum:** When the school knows about your absence, your instructors can help you plan around it, perhaps by adjusting due dates or providing materials in advance so you can stay on track.\n\n**Demonstrates Responsibility:** Taking the initiative to communicate about absences shows maturity and commitment to your education—qualities that will serve you well beyond high school.\n\n**Prevents Misunderstandings:** Without proper notification, extended periods of inactivity might be misinterpreted as disengagement or lack of effort, potentially affecting your standing in the course.\n\n**Ensures Compliance:** Excel High School has specific policies regarding attendance and engagement. Proper notification helps ensure you remain in good standing with these policies.\n\n**Facilitates Support:** When the school knows about your absence in advance, they can better support your return and help you quickly reintegrate into your studies.\n\n### The Absence Notification Commitment\n\nCreating a personal system for tracking and communicating planned absences will help you maintain consistent communication with Excel High School. Use this checklist to solidify your commitment to proper absence notification:\n\n**Absence Notification Commitment Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] I will review my calendar at the beginning of each month to identify any upcoming planned absences.\n- [ ] I will notify Excel High School at least one week before a short absence (1-3 days).\n- [ ] I will notify Excel High School at least two weeks before an extended absence (4+ days).\n- [ ] My notification will include:\n  * My full name and student ID number\n  * Specific dates of absence (first and last day)\n  * Brief explanation (while keeping personal details private)\n  * My plan for managing coursework during this time\n- [ ] I will email my academic advisor and copy my course instructors.\n- [ ] I will contact my instructor(s) directly for absences that might affect specific course deadlines.\n- [ ] If an emergency absence occurs, I will notify the school as soon as reasonably possible.\n- [ ] I will check for responses to my absence notifications and follow any additional guidance provided.\n- [ ] I will update the school if my absence plans change (extended or shortened duration).\n- [ ] I understand that consistent communication about attendance demonstrates my commitment to academic success.\n\nBy checking each box, you're making a concrete commitment to maintaining open communication with Excel High School regarding your attendance.
